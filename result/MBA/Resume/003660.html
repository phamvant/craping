<p>1, do i need to list all the training courses i have attended, facilitated or delivered, \'cause i was a hr specialist in company?</p>
<p>2, in what way can i show my accomplishment or contribution to our business, in terms of increasing employee satisfaction, saving labor cost by improving skill and ability, promoting the morale and sense of belonging?</p>
<p>3, big part of my past w/e was about registration and other issues related to law or regulation. i understand it is important, time-consuming and demonding, but all of it is administrative. can i show my talent by demonstrate that?</p>
<p>4, it is hard to show my contribution to the business in terms of cost saving or sales increasing, even i do believe i did a good job and partly, indirectly helped the business development. does anyone have better idea to show my ability through the resume.</p>

<p>--&nbsp; <br>I think you can use cost saving in resume while talk sth soft such as morale and culture in ur esay.&nbsp; resume only cannot do too much.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Legal services work epends on your whole application strategy.&nbsp; If you would not mention it at all. ANd if it has nothing to do with ur career goal.&nbsp; Then not sow on resume.</p>

<p>1. I think it is helpful to list them. Actually if you can integrate them with other application materials such as essays and recommendation letter.</p>
<p>2. how about develop corporate culture? or solve culture conflicts? (if your company has many employees from other areas) or develop new employee training program?</p>
<p>3. any conflicts in your job? did you develop new ideas? or team work?<br>&nbsp;</p>

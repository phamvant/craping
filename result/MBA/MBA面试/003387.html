<h1 class="aTitle">Rotman MBA 2021 Video Interview 总结 [2020.07.23]</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>申请学校：Columbia NYU Rotman</p>
<p><strong>BG:&nbsp;</strong>GMAT 2016 700 美国有一个全奖的 MSA DIY T 免
四年中国四大 四年其他 Financial Experience MSA 毕业后美国小 Firm 两年经验</p>
<p>美国人申学校没有特别多的，美国的顶级中介或者导师最多建议 5 所，不好的会建议更多，美国最好的最大的资讯机构是 Stacy Blackman,好的咨询会有 M16 或者 top 10 前或现任招生官帮你 brianstorm 和改文书，我自己用了他们两小时做 brainstorm,但只为了一个学校 Columbia.效果不是很好，但会告知要注意的问题，比如推荐信最好 800 字左右，不要太少。批评要 gentle 之类。有一些用处。</p>
<p>因为在纽约三年，纽约的学校自然首选。但这个城市像围城。外边没来居住过的，不是旅行，都喜欢和憧憬。但居住过的觉得就是北京人在纽约说的地狱，除二代挥金如土生活潇洒惬意，Manhattan 单独 apartment 5000 起挑自己住的话。每天我在路上时间 3 小时至少，每天睡 5 小时。</p>
<p>话回 Rotman,video interview 已经不再是 Kira 了，是他们自己的系统和问题。Kira 的问题有参考价值但方向有偏颇。面试题应该是一年都是一样的。我贴出来我在中国美国所有网站找到的题库，应该是目前最全的，免费分享大家。今年的面试题目没放里面。Video 面试要有自信，你可以有口音，说话慢，说清楚就好。我见了太多 Columbia 的学生那个口音。中国的、新加坡的、土耳其的、印度的。我好奇怎么过的面试。</p>
<p>加拿大我去了四次，都是周末飞过去吃东西，找小姐姐。印度人是大部分，而且是传统上海的阿三，包头巾教派。因为加拿大对印度人有优惠的移民政策。冬天超冷，比 Boston 还冷，下大雪我开过几次车，做好准备。</p>
<p>祝未来同学们一切顺利。</p>

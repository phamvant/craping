<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>9.&nbsp; Health Care Management</p>
<p>What do health care managers do?</p>
<p>Health care managers play essential roles in keeping the business of health care running smoothly. They plan, direct, coordinate and supervise the delivery of health care. </p>
<p>In large facilities, health care managers may work with several assistant administrators to direct activities in specific clinical departments such as nursing, surgery or therapy. These managers may have more specific responsibilities and training or experience in a clinical area. They establish and implement policies, objectives and procedures for their departments; evaluate personnel and work; develop reports and budgets and coordinate activities with other managers. </p>
<p>Some health care managers may oversee the activities of a number of facilities in health systems. Such systems may include both inpatient and outpatient facilities and offer a wide range of patient services. </p>
<p>Managers in smaller facilities may handle more of the details of daily operations - personnel, finance, facility operations and resident care. In group practices, a health care manager may work closely with physicians and advise on business strategies and coordinate day-to-day business. The responsibilities of managers in managed care settings may extend to areas of community outreach and preventative care. </p>
<p>What degree options are available in health care managment?</p>
<p>Undergraduates can earn a bachelor’s in health care management. Graduate students can earn a master’s degree in health care management or an MBA with a concentration in health care management. </p>
<p>What''s the difference between a master''s in health care management and an MBA with a health care management concentration? </p>
<p>The basic difference between these two options is that the master’s degree is highly specialized and will allow you to focus almost exclusively on health care management. In contrast, an MBA program is designed to develop a general set of management skills in a variety of areas while you learn about health care management practices through specialized elective courses. <br>There are advantages to each: a master’s program will enable you to delve into health care management issues in greater depth; an MBA program will allow you to spend your first year developing a set of skills that can be transferred to other areas and your second year specializing in health care management. </p>
<p>While both a master’s degree and an MBA concentration will prepare you to hold management positions, master’s programs are designed to help you become a leader in the specific field. In contrast, an MBA degree may also qualify you to hold management positions in other fields, should you become interested in a different career. </p>
<p>What will I study?</p>
<p>An MBA with a health care management concentration generally consists of core courses in management fundamentals during the first year and a selection of elective courses specific to health care during the second year. Core courses may include accounting, economics, finance, information systems, marketing, operations management, organizational behavior, quantitative methods and strategic planning. The concentration may include courses that apply the general management knowledge to the context of health care systems – for example, health economics, health care finance, health care marketing – as well as explore areas such as the legal aspects of health care management, managed health care, long-term care administration, health care reform and epidemiology for managers. <br>What career paths do health care management graduates follow?<br>Graduates in health care management pursue executive positions in a wide variety of health care organizations. Positions range from associate manager to assistant director to chief administrator in organizations such as hospitals, HMOs, health insurance and pharmaceutical companies in the private sector to health departments, academic medical centers, mental health agencies, regulatory agencies and various community-based agencies in the public sector. Graduates are also finding opportunities in long-term care - in nursing homes, home-health care, secondary or sub-acute care, senior and retirement centers, as well as various other agencies which care for chronically ill individuals. </p>
<p>What''s the overall career outlook for health care management?</p>
<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in the field of health care management is expected to grow faster than average through 2010 as the health services industry expands and diversifies. Opportunities should be especially good in home health care, long-term care and non-traditional health organizations such as managed care operations and consulting firms. <br>Hospitals will continue to employ the most managers, but jobs will become increasingly competitive as hospitals consolidate, centralize and diversify functions. Employment is expected to grow the fastest in residential care facilities and practitioners’ offices and clinics as services previously provided in hospitals shift more to those sectors. Demand in medical group practice management is also expected to grow as those practices become larger and more complex. Opportunities will also come from health care management companies who provide services to hospitals and other organizations, as well as specific departments such as emergency, information management systems, managed care contract negotiations and physician recruiting. </p>
<p>Ultimately, managers with strong business and management skills acquired through a master’s program as well as work experience in the health care field – particularly specialized experience - will have the best opportunities</p>

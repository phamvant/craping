<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>TOEFL (Courtesy from greenoak @ GC)</p>
<p>Notes:<br>1. All requirements are for TOEFL iBT format, unless specified otherwise<br>2. All information was taken from official schools' sites.<br>3. Even if school does not have an official cut-off score, or if this score seems ridiculously low, it is an applicant's interest to check an average score of the accepted students in order to form a realistic understanding of what is required.<br>4. Overall, it seems you will be OK with 100 for the vast majority of schools, but you will need closer to at least 110 for the most competitive ones.</p>

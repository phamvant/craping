<p>Try University of Nevada Las Vegas, it\'s at least number two in the US. </p>
<p>I think Cornell hotel school is more like a business school, but UNLV offers more work opportunities due to its location amongst tons of world-class hotel/casinos.&nbsp; Add you can do a MBA and MS dual degree at UNLV, which is very popular in the job market.&nbsp; Here\'s a link. </p>

<p>&nbsp;Who\'s Got the Biggest? </p>
<p>Reputation, that is. A look at the battle between UNLV and Cornell to be the world\'s best hotel administration program </p>
<p>By Damon Hodge </p>
<p>Useful as they are, sports analogies have limitations. Say, for instance, you\'re trying to determine who has the world\'s best hotel administration program—the Ivy League\'s Cornell University out of Ithaca, New York, or (wild cheers) hometown favorite the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Equipped with the best faculty, curriculum and research programs, Cornell (ranked No. 1 by Newsweek) and UNLV (the world\'s largest and most expansive program) are the undisputed heavyweights in this academic discipline, the competition between them a veritable Rumble in the Hospitality-Related Jungle.</p>
<p>The problem is deciding who\'s Muhammad Ali and who\'s George Foreman. Both are Hall of Fame fighters and personalities, Ali a worldwide icon and treasured humanitarian and Foreman a perpetually smiling, mega-rich pitchman for his self-named grill and (even better) a columnist for Esquire. And while Ali knocked Foreman out in their only head-to-head matchup, who\'s to say that if they fought 10 more times, he\'d win all 10?</p>
<p>So it is with crowning an undisputed champ in hospitality education—Cornell\'s program is the grizzled veteran, founded in 1922 in scenic Ithaca, New York; UNLV\'s is the brash youngster, opened in 1967 a mile east of what\'s likely the world\'s most kinetic hospitality-related environment. To make the decision tougher, each school has a top-notch dean, world-class professors and powerhouse alumni in top jobs at some of the world\'s largest hospitality companies. Perhaps the best way to settle this academic debate is, well, via sport.</p>
<p>Volleyball anyone?</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>For the past decade, the hospitality industry has been among the nation\'s fastest growing industries. According to North Dakota State\'s Hospitality and Tourism Management Program, hotel-keeping ranks seventh among service industries. The National Restaurant Association reports 11.3 million food industry workers, making it one of the nation\'s top generators of job growth.</p>
<p>A 1998 salary analysis by hotel-online.com showed management (general managers and directors) earning between $49,000 and $150,000 annually—salaries increase by the size and luxuriousness of the property. But hotel administration graduates are just as likely to work in catering, food and beverage administration, and restaurants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Notable Cornell Hotel School Alumni&nbsp; </p>
<p>Brad Stone (executive vice president of the Las Vegas Sands), Richard Cotter (executive vice president at Wynn Las Vegas), Dan Lee (CEO at Pinnacle), Dave Hanlon, (former president of International Game Technology, the Rio and Resorts International), Larry Lewin (CEO of Hyatt Gaming), Chris Komanowski (vice president for development for Harrah\'s), Marc Falcone (managing director of Deutsche Bank Hospitality Gaming), Paul Berry (vice president of hotel service for Bellagio), Doug Seidenberg (vice president of casino marketing at T.I.), Steve Opdyke (vice president of hotel operations at Paris), Andre Carrier (chief operating officer at the Golden Nugget Laughlin), Tobias Mattstedt (vice president of development at MGM).</p>
<p>"What you really learn is how to operate a property and bring guests to property," says Scott Sibella, a UNLV hotel administration graduate and president and chief operating officer of The Mirage. There are 300 employees in management at The Mirage alone. With a hotel administration degree, says Sibella, "you can run everything from a restaurant to a theme park to a hotel. It teaches you to be an entrepreneur."</p>
<p>Among the Ivies </p>
<p>To avoid any appearance of home-cooking, Cornell University bats first—the school\'s press materials arrived earlier than UNLV\'s. Said press materials note that Cornell\'s School of Hotel Administration is "the world\'s leader in hospitality management, education and research"—fighting words?—and has the oldest program of its kind in the nation, its Center for Hospitality Research, opening in 1922.</p>
<p>According to Hotel Administration Communications Director Bill Summers, the program has 800 undergraduates from the United States and 42 countries in its program, 60 chapters in the alumni society, 40 of which are overseas—among the notable local alums is 1995 graduate Elizabeth Blau, the restaurant guru responsible for luring a large contingent of celebrity chefs to Mirage, Bellagio and Wynn Las Vegas. More than 1,700 hospitality industry professionals from 90 countries are enrolled in the executive education program, Summer says, and each year 250 industry leaders lecture at Cornell and more than 140 hospitality companies recruit students for summer employment. (UNLV compares favorably in most areas; it has triple the number of students, with 2,700; each school offers more than 100 courses).</p>
<p>As flacks go, Summers is nice enough, but I\'m looking for reasons why Cornell is the best, about how (I feel a sports\' euphemism coming) all it has to do is stay focused and play its game and everything will be fine, about how everyone else is playing for second place—where\'s that vaunted Ivy League erudition?</p>
<p>The college\'s retiring dean, David Butler (who sort of resembles Gov. Kenny Guinn in press shots) is traveling and unavailable, so the bragging responsibilities go to Gary Thompson, professor and executive director of Cornell\'s Center for Hospitality Research. After cautioning me to be wary of anything an administrator says about its programs, he offers a joke: "You will hear comments like, \'We\'re next to Cornell or we\'re No. 2 after Cornell.\' Truth is, we can\'t see that far down." He\'s not laughing. "There is a big gap between Cornell and its competitors and that gap exists for a variety of reasons ... We have the oldest program in the nation, we\'re in an institution of Cornell\'s caliber and we have an extensive alumni network. UNLV has an advantage over us because it\'s right in the middle of a gaming environment. So if you looked at gaming, you\'d probably see a higher proportion of UNLV alumni in that industry as opposed to Cornell graduates. Theirs is more a niche strategy at UNLV."</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>"UNLV has a large proportion of part-time students because there are jobs for them; not in Ithaca. Most students are full-time students, which makes a difference in the caliber of the students we\'re able to attract ... we have a student profile that correlates with success. The level of intelligence and maturity we see (in incoming students) is impressive. Over time, we\'ve been able to attract highly capable people that go on to positions of prominence in the industry. This becomes self-perpetuating, as alumni refer students to Cornell."</p>
<p>Not only does Cornell attract higher-quality students, Thompson says, but its philosophy on hiring faculty is unique: "Cornell hires professors with unique skill sets, people who are expected to make contributions to their disciplines, and that doesn\'t necessarily mean writing tons of books. Most business schools (are) out of touch with reality; either their faculties lack real-world business experience or they prioritize publishing over curricula." Prior to coming to Cornell, Thompson spent eight years on the faculty of the business school at the University of Utah, where he mainly dealt with workforce scheduling, a huge part of the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>"I hadn\'t worked in the industry directly, but I had a skill set that was a value to the industry," he says. "I have world-renowned colleagues, people who are good academics and can work in business. We\'ve really got a vibrant place for hospitality research ... people come from all over the world to view our content. There\'s not a comparable match in any other hospitality institution worldwide."</p>
<p>UNLV—Beyond Compare</p>
<p>UNLV\'s hotel administration program has come a long way since reputed Cleveland mobster and Stardust owner Moe Dalitz paid for the college\'s first furnishings. The website for the program invites prospective students to "gain a world-class education in the world\'s greatest hospitality and tourism laboratory."</p>
<p>Dean Stuart Mann\'s office is on the third floor of the Stan Fulton Gaming Institute. Mann, who has the textured look of a lifelong academician, talks with a folksy, disarming charm—upper crust without being uppity. Dean of the hotel college since 1998, Mann is used to the comparisons and questions—who\'s better and why? "I am not going to say anything bad about Cornell," he begins.</p>
<p>Darn, there goes the story. Then comes this: "There\'s no comparison." Sounds like fighting words. But it\'s not what you think: He means there\'s no reason to compare the schools: "We\'re like apples and oranges."</p>
<p>Where Cornell focuses on teaching the functional side of hospitality, with an emphasis on accounting and finance, Mann says, "We\'re more focused on hospitality operations, with an understanding of the functional side of the business. Our graduates work in hotels, on cruise lines and can run those operations. In human resources, hospitality operations, MIS (Management Information Systems) and other areas, there\'s a high demand for professionals in specialty areas like meetings, events and gaming and we offer courses in those areas, too. Forty percent of Cornell graduates never go into the hospitality industries, according to their own research."</p>
<p>Other areas that make UNLV different—Mann refuses to say better—include price (costs four times less than Cornell); entrance requirements (Cornell requires 1300 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, UNLV an 1100 SAT score); work experience (Mann says that upon graduating, UNLV students have 1,000 hours of work experience compared to 800 for their Cornell counterparts); more programs (UNLV\'s tourism and convention program is regarded as the nation\'s best); and more faculty (60 to 55 full-time—though Cornell boasts of the "world\'s largest group of scholars focused on hospitality service-oriented management").</p>
<p>A particular source of pride for Mann is how so many books written by UNLV professors have become standard reading in hospitality programs worldwide—remember Cornell\'s Thompson\'s critique on prolific publishing professors?</p>
<p>The titles reflect the diversity of UNLV\'s programs: A Club Managers Guide to Private Parties and Club Functions by Joe Perdue, Rhonda Montgomery, Patti Shock and John Stefanelli (John Wiley &amp; Sons, April 1998); Marketing for Hospitality and Tourism by Philip Kotler, John R. Bowen and James C. Makens (Prentice Hall; 3rd edition July 10, 2002); and Managing Hospitality Human Resources by Michael Dalbor and Robert Chatfield (Prentice Hall, May 26, 2004).</p>
<p>Mann downplays his role in elevating the hotel college, but clearly he shouldn\'t. Under his guidance, the college has expanded to include bachelor\'s degrees in gaming and culinary arts management and created majors in beverage, food service, lodging and resorts, and meetings and events management—all are under the bachelor of science rubric. UNLV has signed memorandums of understanding for cooperation with universities in Korea, Japan, Macao, Hong Kong China, Australia (Queensland University of Technology for a joint master\'s program in event management) and, pending approval from the Japanese government, will open a UNLV-Singapore campus, in June. Created will be a 2+2 Exchange, Mann says, where students will complete two years of bachelor\'s degree study in hotel administration at UNLV and two in Singapore. That UNLV is opening a campus, as opposed to partnering in an institution—next June, Cornell will start a joint master\'s program with Nanyang Technology University in Singapore—is a positive sign. "It shows the respect the government there (in Japan) has for our program. The government wants to deliver an international education to its students," Mann says.</p>
<p>Even the fact that more companies come to Cornell than UNLV to recruit—250 to 100—doesn\'t dampen Mann\'s spirits. Just the opposite. Of the 400 to 500 students graduating annually, he says, 40 percent stay in Las Vegas to work and 25 percent are international students who leave after one year. This leaves 35 percent—180 or so—from which companies can choose.</p>
<p>"Our enrollment rises 10 percent every year and that\'s with little advertising. Cornell is the best at what they do, and we\'re the best at what we do. We do a lot."</p>
<p>The Cornell-UNLV Connection</p>
<p>In the book, The Right Place—UNLV College of Hotel Administration, An Anecdotal History, Cornell is mentioned on 25 of the 332 pages. One passage recounts the story of Gabe Vigliotti, a paid consultant to the Nevada Resort Association (NRA) who wanted to establish a hotel program at the then-Nevada Southern University. Aware that previous efforts had failed, on December 27, 1967, he wrote a letter to Sands hotel-casino Publicity Director Al Freeman: "I don\'t think the idea (for a hotel program) stemmed from the hotel industry. And there is certainly no basis (for your question) that the NRA had to prod the university. Both sides were laid-back, but boy, it\'s become the Cornell of the West."</p>
<p>Also referenced is a Review-Journal story noting "Vigliotti\'s pledge to help fund a building like Statler Hall at Cornell," on how the hotel industry is poaching management talent from Eastern universities. Cited, too, is a Las Vegas Sun story exposing internal conflicts surrounding the creation of UNLV\'s program: "Although similarities between the proposed program and Cornell\'s, including the building and the curriculum, are cited, the newspaper story fails to identify (Howard) Meek (executive director of the Council on Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Education) as the retired, first dean of the Cornell program. Likely, the omission is intentional: As a private consultant, Meek could not ethically invoke the Cornell name."</p>
<p>&nbsp;Notable UNLV Hotel School Alumni&nbsp; </p>
<p>Bill McBeath (president of Bellagio), Tony Santo (senior vice president of Caesars Entertainment), Cynthia Kiser Murphy, (senior vice president of human resources as MGM MIRAGE), Paula Eylar (vice president of internal audit for Boyd Gaming), Jim Germain (president of USA Hosts), Ferenc Szony (president of the Sands Regency in Reno), George Maloof (president of the Palms), Laurel Davis (partner in the law firm of Lionel Sawyer and Collins), John Cottrill (vice president of product and brand management at the Ritz Carlton in Atlanta, Georgia), R. Scott Barber (senior vice president and general manager at Harrah\'s Atlantic City), Chuck Lehman, (president of Fresh and Ready Foods in Southern California and Las Vegas), Rakesh Bhatnagar (vice president of purchasing for American Casino and Entertainment Properties, LLC).</p>
<p>Midway through the interview with Mann, he lets this cat out of the bag: The first dean of UNLV\'s hotel college, Jerome Vallen, got his doctoral degree from—where else?—Cornell, ensuring the two schools would be forever linked. Vallen also co-wrote The Right Place with Flossie Allen. And the links continue: Dina Zemsky, who received a master\'s degree at Cornell and a Ph.D at UNLV and is returning to Cornell to teach. (Attempts to reach her were unsuccessful.) In the "Class Notes" section in back of the Spring 2005 edition of the Cornell Hotel School magazine is an update on 1973 graduate Craig Spaak, whose daughter, Julia, graduated from—where else?—UNLV\'s hotel school.</p>
<p>Facilities and Surroundings </p>
<p>Were the competition between Cornell and UNLV based on facilities, Cornell might come out on top. At the Hotel Ezra Cornell, students run the entire operation for three days as part of their matriculation. (Three junior/senior-level students studying restaurant management plan and manage the Rhapsody At the Terrace Restaurant for one night for up to 200 paying guests). There\'s also the Statler Hotel, a 150-room J.W. Marriott property on campus.</p>
<p>Meantime, the Stan Fulton Gaming Institute, which houses the hotel college, is accessible via a side street on Flamingo or the university\'s northernmost entrance on Maryland Parkway (you\'ll travel a few hundred yards, turn right, then left and proceed to the back). You\'ll cross a ravine in which you can see green algae surfing eastward on streams of wastewater. Given the college\'s prominence—alumni include Palms hotel-casino owner George Maloof, and T.I. President Scott Sibella, both 1988 graduates—you\'d think it would have a more prominent position in campus geography, sidling up to the snazzy new $40 million library. Inside, there are banquet facilities (training quarters) and a mini casino (a gaming "laboratory").</p>
<p>UNLV seems to have an upper hand in terms of the surrounding environs. As Mann says, "Las Vegas is the world\'s greatest hospitality and tourism laboratory," an assertion borne out of the city\'s kinetic transformation from hedonistic playground to (still hedonistic) metropolis of 130,000 hotel rooms, world-class dining, shopping, entertainment and gaming. Plus, there are more people in Summerlin (50,000) than in Ithaca (30,000). When out-of-state parents question him about Las Vegas\' gluttonous, party-all-time reputation, Mann stresses that the city doesn\'t have a monopoly on vice. Big city, small town—makes no difference, you can find trouble anywhere. "Hopefully they\'ve raised their children well enough to avoid the pitfalls out there," says Mann.</p>
<p>Thompson sees Cornell\'s relatively staid and remote location as a minus. "We\'re at a location disadvantage ... Ithaca, New York, is not in a major center," he says, "but we overcome that with the quality of the program."</p>
<p>Alumni Nation and The Final Score </p>
<p>Mark Birtha is in enemy territory. But not in the Marines-battling-Iraqi-insurgents sense. A 1994 Cornell hotel administration graduate, Birtha is director of casino marketing and administration for the Venetian, just a few miles east of the Stan Fulton building. In his position, he\'s hired both UNLV and Cornell students.</p>
<p>"I have much respect for UNLV students; in fact, I married one. "My wife (Roxana) is a UNLV hotel-school grad," he says. "Each school has its strengths and weaknesses which differentiate them in terms of status and regard."</p>
<p>Birtha lists UNLV\'s strengths as having the "best working environment laboratory" in the Strip and Downtown, and an excellent academic and outstanding gaming curriculum. Being in Las Vegas sometimes works against UNLV, as students might work and thus take longer to graduate; some don\'t finish school at all. Since the program is 45 years younger than Cornell\'s, he says, the alumni database is not as strong nor as deep. Birtha says Cornell\'s local chapter of hotel college alumni has grown from 20 members to more than 125 since 1994.</p>
<p>As Cornell\'s strengths, he cites a rigorous academic discipline and an alumni database and network "with graduates in positions around the world in all facets of the industry and other businesses and entrepreneurs who\'ve started companies such as Duty Free Shops, Alamo Rental Car, Harney Teas and Burger King." On the minus side: "Cornell tends to be a bit more academic as opposed to hands-on, and many of the students leave school with very aggressive and sometimes unrealistic expectations."</p>
<p>Most of UNLV\'s hotel college alumni aren\'t as visible as George Maloof, a 1988 graduate who owns the Palms, quite possibly the hippest hotel-casino in the world. Respected when he graduated in 1988—the same years as Maloof (See sidebar for other alums)—Scott Sibella, president of the Mirage, says UNLV hotel administration program is stronger now, buoyed by diverse offerings and proximity to the world\'s hottest tourist market.</p>
<p>"Besides the education you receive, you have 130,000 hotel rooms in your backyard. No other campus has this. Students can go on tours and gain practical experience in house," Sibella says.</p>
<p>(His UNLV education has served him well: vice president posts—hotel and operations, casino marketing—at Trump Taj Mahal; vice president for casino marketing at the Tropicana in Atlantic City and in Las Vegas; senior vice president of casino marketing at Treasure Island (now called T.I.) before being promoted to vice president of casino marketing at The Mirage; named president and chief operating officer of Treasure Island in May 2000, he now holds the same posts at The Mirage).</p>
<p>Sibella thinks UNLV hasn\'t garnered Cornell-type acclaim largely because of more malleable entrance standards—lower requirements on grade-point average and aptitude test scores. "We accept all students that apply," he says.</p>
<p>Yet, he says, the caliber of each program\'s graduates is top notch—MGM Mirage\'s Management Assistant Program is peppered with alumni from both schools. Cornell grads are generally well grounded in finance and accounting, Sibella says, while their UNLV counterparts seem well-rounded, particularly strong in areas related to customer service.</p>
<p>"The main difference is in the mentality of the (Cornell) students ...you can often tell they\'re from back east," he says.</p>
<p>In the end, judging which hotel school is best may depend on what you\'re looking at and for. But if you base your decision on who\'s bested who in the athletic arena, then UNLV might rate higher. On September 11, UNLV\'s women\'s volleyball team beat Cornell 30-21, 30-23, 30-25 in a tournament in Northridge, California.</p>

<p>--&nbsp; [转帖]推荐信范例(MBA专业)</p>
<p>University of International Business and Economics<br>Beijing 100029, P. R. China <br>Sept. 28, 1998<br>Dear colleagues:</p>
<p>This is to recommend Ms. Shan Shan, a graduate from this university’s department of International Business Management, for acceptance into your MBA program.</p>
<p>I have known Ms. Shan as a resourceful and goal-oriented individual since 1990, when she attended a lecture I delivered, at which she asked perceptive and challenging questions. Although she did not officially take a course with me, she often consulted me on issues arising out of her studies. I therefore have come to know her well. I feel strongly that Ms. Shan’s unusual talents and abilities will stand her in good stead for a quality MBA education, which should serve as a major boost to her career.</p>
<p>While at this university, Ms. Shan was an outstanding student, boasting excellent performance in all subjects of her studies and demonstrating great potential. Her overall GPA ranked her among the top 3 in her class of 40 students. But Ms. Shan was no bookworm devoted exclusively to exams. She read extensively in subjects outside her major, particularly in business law, marketing, finance and journalism, all of which seemed to be fascinating to her. In recognition of her intellectual strengths, the department offered, at the time of her graduation, to accept her into its graduate without the normally mandatory examinations. She, however, turned down the offer. A highly independent woman, she already had her own agenda set. She wanted to obtain practical management experience first and then proceed to pursue a Master’s Degree in Business Administrative in your country. She apparently made the right decision, for she has since become one of our most successful graduates in her crop of students.</p>
<p>Ms. Shan is good at communicating in both oral and written English. Some of he most important undergraduate courses were taught by American professors, many of whom considered her oral English as native and her written English as standard. I am sure that she has since improved her English a lot more in her professional life.</p>
<p>In Ms. Shan, we all saw an optimistic and easy-going character. With highly unusual determination, she is not to be daunted by any difficulties. She believes that, with hard work, she can achieve anything she wants. I think her confidence in herself is well grounded in her track record, especially when considering the fact that she entered into this university as the daughter of a most impoverished family, but graduated as a top student.</p>
<p>Judging by what I know of her, I think Ms. Shan is fully qualified to pursue an MBA degree in your program. I therefore recommend her with enthusiasm. And I shall greatly appreciate if you can favorably consider her application for admission and financial aid.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>

<p>--&nbsp; <br>Do you think that a general recommendation letter, i.e. one that does not answer specific questions in the recom form, but is more like the above yet even less detailed, will play a key negative role in one\'s admission? </p>
<p>In my 2001 application, one of my recommenders was too occupied to tailor-make his letters. So he simply produced envelopes containing ticked/signed forms and a "universal" letter of recommendation. He should have covered most of the key factors that schools look for, cuz I gave him a question list that summarized the schools\' requests and sat down to talk through them. But busy as he was, I don\'t think he could have gone into detailed samples like those in the above. All in all, it was just a mediocre recomm I guess. Do you think it played against me a LOT that year? </p>
<p>Also, any insights on: How do b-school adcoms view recomm letters today? Especially, those from Chinese students? How much weight is put there? </p>
<p>So here\'s another thought: I understand that there are many highly competitive applicants out there, who are able to present "dinasour-level" recomms in addition to a "perfect" application package. So for us less stellar applicants, is there any hope to beat them, besides playing the "non-traditional career path" card? (Which, by the way, I don\'t have. :) Seems no chance, uh? ...Am I too perssmistic? </p>

<p>--&nbsp; <br>我觉得推荐信的效果应该这样来看比较客观一点：一封强的推荐信并不能让你脱颖而出，但是一封比较弱的推荐信肯定会有负面的影响。</p>
<p>所以对我们申请人来说，无非就是尽自己最大的努力把这个游戏玩好。 <br>--------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;<br>--&nbsp; 作者：vas<br>--&nbsp; 发布时间：2003-7-21 2:20:00</p>
<p>--&nbsp; <br>My recommender did not have time to tailor-make my RL, either. I am very disappointed that I have never seen a really objective letter sample. <br>I will bet $100 that this sample is not written by a responsible professor, if not written by a greenhand applicant. Not to offense, chipmunk bro, one is far better than non.<br>I intepret chipmunk\'s words in this way: taking the application process as a whole (game) will be more helpful than being obsessed with "stellar recommendor" or "tailored for this school." You\'d better have these, but many who don\'t have still get admitted to top schools.&nbsp; </p>

<p>--&nbsp; Number 6 - YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS</p>
<p><br>I\'ll let you in on a little secret that even most admissions officers don\'t know (or won\'t admit to knowing): A significant percentage of applicants to top B-schools write their own letters of recommendation.&nbsp; I know this because I\'m on the "sell side" of the admissions transaction.&nbsp; (I sound like an investment banker, don\'t I?)&nbsp; My students regularly ask me what they should write in their recommendations. </p>
<p>It isn\'t that applicants are trying to cheat the game; the problem is that most recommenders don\'t want to take the time to write a long letter or fill in the "grid boxes" found in some recommendation forms.&nbsp; So they ask the applicant to do the dirty work and agree to sign the finished product. </p>
<p>What if I Don\'t Want My Employer to Know That I\'m Leaving?</p>
<p>This is a tough situation, and schools hear this same question from hundreds of applicants every year.&nbsp; They always answer something like, "Well, just do the best you can."&nbsp; </p>
<p>I\'ve never heard a good answer to this question.&nbsp; My suggestion is that you get a recommendation from one of your customers, but that isn\'t always possible.&nbsp; The top schools want two recommendations (except Harvard, which asks for three).&nbsp; If you can\'t get the full quota, then send what you can get.&nbsp; That causes a lot of worry, but in the end I don\'t think it makes much difference.&nbsp; Just include a note stating why you can\'t get more recommendations.&nbsp; The schools will understand. </p>
<p>A Few Pointers on the Letters of Recommendation</p>
<p>There\'s an entire section on writing the recommendations at this Web site, so I won\'t address it here.&nbsp; Be sure to check that section out, though, after finishing the Seven Application Elements.</p>
<p>A Final Comment on the Letter of Recommendation </p>
<p>You may hear from some admissions people that they put a great deal of emphasis on letters of recommendation.&nbsp; I hope, for the sake of applicants, that they are bluffing to justify putting your recommender through an arduous process.&nbsp; The quality of your recommendation is so closely tied to your recommender\'s ability to write that it wouldn\'t be fair to place much emphasis on it.&nbsp; Some recommenders are very good writers, and some have even gone to top MBA schools and know what to write about.&nbsp; Others are terrible writers and don\'t know what the admissions people are looking for.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you don\'t believe that the recommendation is more reflective of the writer than of the applicant, then have your boss write a letter for you.&nbsp; I\'ll make up a recommendation for your officemate (against whom you are competing for a spot at Wharton).&nbsp; You can judge for yourself which candidate looks better on paper.</p>

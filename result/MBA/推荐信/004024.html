<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p><strong>How long have you know the candidate:</strong></p>
<p>I have known Ms. W since year X1.&nbsp; Ms. W reported to me as positionA in CompanyA when I was the positionB.&nbsp; CompanyA has been the leading Software Products and Solutions provider in the industryA in China with over $100 million USD in annual revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Two areas where the candidate is the most distinguished:</strong></p>
<p>Ms. W was very dedicated and motivated, and she had exceptional organizational abilities.&nbsp; Her tenure at CompanyA coincides with the height of the Internet boom, when customer expectations grow on daily basis and technologies update rapidly.&nbsp; With her dedication and motivation, she stayed ahead of the customers and the technology team, and won the trust and support of both.&nbsp; Since the team was young with people of differing levels of expertise, she showed her great organizational skills to get the team developed and organized.&nbsp; It was an everyday thing for her and members of her team to fly all over the map in winning contracts after contracts in every major industryAplayer in China.</p>
<p><strong>Areas for improvement and growth:</strong></p>
<p>She joined CompanyA with limited industrial experience.&nbsp; She was a fast learner and had a great career experience at CompanyA.&nbsp; I believe that her experience in recent years in multiple industries has given her a wider and wiser understanding of the IT industry.</p>
<p><strong>Interpersonal skill and abilities to maintain relationships:</strong></p>
<p>She is an out-going person, and her great success as a pre-positionA highlights her interpersonal skills.&nbsp; Well, we haven’t met for X2 years and I still consider her to be a great friend, and I am not alone.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership abilities:</strong></p>
<p>We gave her the opportunity to lead the department because she was always well prepared.&nbsp; When we had to submit proposals to an industryAplayer with new an industryA solutions, her meticulous research and well-organized presentation won the support of our team, and the customers.</p>
<p>Before her tenure, we had to reply on a few high-level consultants.&nbsp; When she was leading her growing departmentA, she encouraged everyone to succeed.&nbsp; For new members, she would gave them in-house training, and sit by their initial industryA solution proposals to smaller customers.&nbsp; In her supervision, we quickly have a team, that each member was capable of leading large-scale solution proposals.</p>
<p><strong>Impact on the organization:</strong></p>
<p>DepartmentA is the most critical department in winning customers.&nbsp; She was regarded by the senior management team as one of the most important contributors to the success of the company in the manager level.</p>

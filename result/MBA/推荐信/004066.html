<p>--&nbsp; [求助]recommendation<br>what do you think the reasons that why this person applies the mba program?</p>
<p>how to answer this question. <br>--------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;<br>--&nbsp; 作者：tsljz<br>--&nbsp; 发布时间：2003-11-6 7:03:00</p>
<p>--&nbsp; <br>i think your recommender can talk about your career maturity, your motivation and how MBA could help you make up for your obvious weaknesses, if there is any(i.e., if you lack business background). For example, you have a clear long term goal and have been pursuing it for a long time. Such an answer may be somewhat close to your "why mba" answer, but from a different perspective. </p>
<p>Just my 2 cents. </p>

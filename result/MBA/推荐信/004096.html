<p>--&nbsp; <br>商管系教授推荐信(转贴)</p>
<p>It gives me a great pleasure to recommend Mr. Cheng as a transfer to the School of Business Administration of your University in the summer quarter of 1989. </p>
<p>During academic year 1980-1984, he was a student in our Department, World College of Journalism. I found him very diligent and intelligent. He often participated in extracurricular activities contributing a great deal to community affairs.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Cheng graduated from this college 5 years ago, he keeps, contact with me very often. Worthy of mention also is his personality, honest, reliable, responsible and mature.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend this promising young man and your favorable consideration and assistance to him will be very much appreciated.</p>

<p>--&nbsp; <br>再一封(转贴)</p>
<p>Dear Addimissions Officer:</p>
<p>I am writing this letter to support the admission of Wenli Lee to the Harvard <br>Business School. I was Mr. Lee\'s teacher and advisor for several years between <br>1993 and 1995. We have met and talked several times since.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee\'s academic credentials are truly exceptional. He not only knows how to<br>reason with numbers, but how to render incisive and imaginative arguments in <br>English. Unlike most of the students I have taught from China(about 60 over <br>the past 20 years) Lee immersed himself in American culture. He composed a <br>joke as part of his first presentation analyzing a local plan. It worked. <br>His classmates laughed and I was witness to masterful culture spanning. Lee <br>came to us a confident individualist uniquely suited to cultural cross <br>fertilization. He earned straight A grades in all my classes. Whether <br>rendering a spread sheet analysis, crafting a graphic or writing a report,<br>Lee always demonstrated uncanny mastery combined with critical wit. While<br>many of the Chinese I have taught performed excellently in class, Lee alone<br>has composed essays and talks that met the sensibilities and tastes of <br>American classmates. Even more importantly he offered new ideas which they <br>(and myself) could comprehend and even assimilate.</p>
<p>Lee has a deep reservoir of talent and ambition. He has already accomplished <br>a great deal in the face of considerable challenge. He has worked hard bridging<br>the cultural gulf separating the Chinese and American ways of life, and <br>produced an impressive record for one who has enjoyed no special privilege. <br>Lee possesses and uses an easygoing manner and spirited conviviality to put <br>people at ease. He can make small talk, but quickly moves conversation toward <br>more challenging and interesting topics. Lee\'s group leadership combines small<br>"d" democracy, intelligent judgment and gentle persistence. He learned early <br>on the painful lessons of coercive collectivism, and has learned how to <br>anticipate and even tame adversarial relations. I have every confidence <br>that he will use these considerable skills to tackle organizational problems<br>on a larger scale.</p>
<p>While a student in our graduate program, Lee took a job helping recovering drug <br>addicts in the suburban community of Harvey. Harvey, an aging industrial suburb <br>with an impoverished African American population, does not usually attract the <br>interest and attention of foreign students from Asia. Lee swam against the strong<br>currents of racism and fear associated with minority neighborhoods. Furthermore,<br>he did so in a manner that added value to the community. Lee has labored for <br>the ABC Authority, a large public bureaucracy, and currently works as a private <br>marketing and research firm. This diversity of experience represents a crucial<br>resource for Lee. He does not simply take jobs, but weaves these experiences<br>together into a framework for understanding American institutions from the <br>inside out. Finally, Lee plays with Americans. He does not hide out in Chinatown<br>or the Chinese cultural center. He rock climbs and sails. He can tell hip from <br>hoopla.</p>
<p>Lee is smart. But more important he has acquired wisdom in the culture of both <br>China and the U.S. He wants to expand his considerable fund of wisdom and use <br>it to provide cultural scaffolding for commercial ties between the U.S. and <br>China. Lee\'s ambitions and abilities are in sync. He is poised and prepared <br>to take this next step in an exciting journey. Not only will faculty and <br>students thank you for admitting such a fine candidate, but so too will <br>those employees, customers and citizens who will benefit from his future <br>employ.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>David Smiths<br>Professor of ABC University</p>

<p>--&nbsp; again about recommendation letter<br>The recommendation letter really bothers me.<br>I\'m currently working in Canada and my supervisor is a Canadian. In her 40\'s, she is very conservative, strict and honest. Although she likes my performance, it\'s not likely that she will say highly of me. Also, as a foreigner working in this company, my oral English might not be as good as the natives. Language also hinder my leadership practices. I\'m sure her recommendation will be positive but not super.</p>
<p>Does anybody working aboard has the same problem? I understand that many Chinese applicants can write their own recommendations, so my mild recommendation will hurt my chance I guess. In addition, the online recommendation takes people longer than the paper ones. Any one in the same boat? <br>--------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;<br>--&nbsp; 作者：tsljz<br>--&nbsp; 发布时间：2003-11-15 11:09:00</p>
<p>--&nbsp; <br>can you try to talk with her and see what she can do for you? If not very positive, you\'d better try someone else. A bad recommendation could destroy your efforts. <br>--------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;<br>--&nbsp; 作者：dianarose<br>--&nbsp; 发布时间：2003-11-19 13:03:00</p>
<p>--&nbsp; <br>Just dont concern severely with this kind of cases. A western professional will never recommend a guy she/he doesn\'t appreciate. Actually "straightforward" recommendation words will not ruin your reputation but strengthen it, since adcoms in b-schools enjoy most reading a REAL person with personal characteristics and diversities, with both convincing advantages and actual disadvantages. While Chinese recommendators, or even applicants themselves, are good at or only capable of composing flattering letters, which will only be thrown into rubbish bins after reviewing - as adcoms will have been enduring hundreds of similar fake letters each year from China.</p>
<p>So just have thorough discussions with your supervisor, share with her your thoughts on personal characteristics, how to strengthen your advantages and fade your disadvantages, and be fully confident against those overstated counterparts from Chinese. :)&nbsp; </p>

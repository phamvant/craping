<p>I would like to enthusiastically recommend John Smith as a strong addition to the Harvard Business School. John not only has the technical qualifications and mental turpitude for admission to your prestigious program, but also has demonstrated the leadership, business acumen, management ability, technical expertise, and oral and written skills necessary to succeed in all that he endeavors.</p>
<p>As John's supervisor at The Insurance Bank for the past two years, I have observed his substantial skills first hand and have been astonished with his level of performance at such a young age. </p>
<p>Although I am four years his senior and have received an MBA, John has consistently displayed insight and knowledge equal to or better than my own, and I rely upon his judgment quite heavily.</p>
<p>In his position as a consultant, John is required not only to perform technical exercises, he is also expected, among other things, to (1) manage multiple projects simultaneously visa a vis predetermined budgets, (2) cultivate and strengthen client relationships, (3) manage a staff of analysts and word processors on client engagements, (4) develop internal systems and procedures, (5) develop new products and services, and (6) think creatively. He has not only fulfilled but has exceeded the expectations of management in each of these very important functions.</p>
<p>Perhaps his strongest abilities are to think creatively and act decisively and correctly. These are skills that cannot be taught and are the principal reasons for John's success to-date. Because of this, John is often called upon by senior management to resolve the most difficult and time sensitive client projects.</p>
<p>I have also had the pleasure of knowing John on a personal basis, and very much enjoy his self-confidence, sense of humor, and personality. John is always the first to organize group activities and has very strong personal relationships both inside and outside the office environment.</p>
<p>Finally, John's unique combination of the above skills with a high level of moral and ethical standards have been critical to his personal and professional development. It is my belief that he will succeed in any undertaking largely because of his determination to adhere to these standards and accomplish his goals with integrity.</p>
<p>I have only touched upon the most important abilities of this highly qualified and motivated individual. With this letter, I can highly recommend John Smith for admission to the Harvard Business School. If you require any elaboration, please call me.</p>

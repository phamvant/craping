<p>--&nbsp; which person should I ask to write recommendation?<br>I have 5 years working experience and low GPA and are preparing for the application of business school. </p>
<p>The school I am interested in need two recommendation letter.<br>I have two choices:<br>1. one recommendation letter from my colleague and the other from my boss, both of which are familiar with me and have a close relationship...</p>
<p>2. one from my boss and the other from my professor in University.<br>the reason I choose my professor is that I want him to prove my academic ability and thereby compensate for my poor GPA? But since he is not so familiar with me , I am not sure how many good words will he speak of me...</p>
<p>which method do you think will help me lot??</p>
<p>thank you very much.. <br>--------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;<br>--&nbsp; 作者：lewis<br>--&nbsp; 发布时间：2003-8-18 12:28:00</p>
<p>--&nbsp; <br>Considering the difference between the familiarity with your colleague and that with your professsor, I would say 1 is the better choice. Also, you can write an optional essay to explain the lower GPA if you really want to clear it. My two cents. <br>--------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;<br>--&nbsp; 作者：albert<br>--&nbsp; 发布时间：2003-8-18 20:42:00</p>

<p>thank you, lewis...I have some more more question:</p>
<p>1. Can I write an additional essay if it is not in the list of essays&nbsp; posted by a school?</p>
<p>2. Do you think that the admission officer will trust my explanation of lower GPA without any support? Maybe my explanation can be better supported by some good words from professor.. But if the admission officer, generally, can trust my explanation without any support, I prefer to use my colleague as reference.</p>
<p>3. Do you think that one colleague that work together with me but not my boss is a good reference for me?</p>
<p>4. "My two cents" , what does it mean? hehe...my poor English..</p>
<p>thank you again..good, luck!</p>

<p>You are welcome.</p>
<p>Normally, business schoosl will ask you to write an optional essay to explain or supplement some facts you consider to be improtant in your application. Again, it is the general case.</p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="quote">2. Do you think that the admission officer will trust my explanation of lower GPA without any support? Maybe my explanation can be better supported by some good words from professor.. But if the admission officer, generally, can trust my explanation without any support, I prefer to use my colleague as reference.</div>
<p>Why not the officers trust you? As long as your explanation is reasonable, they will trust (at least before they get a negative impression on your application package).<br></p>
<div class="quote">3. Do you think that one colleague that work together with me but not my boss is a good reference for me?</div>
<p>As a reference, a boss is preferable to a colleague in MBA application\'s cases.<br></p>
<div class="quote">4. &amp;quot;My two cents&amp;quot; , what does it mean? hehe...my poor English..</div>
<p>Your English is pretty good. "My two cents" means "in my humble opinion".</p>
<p>Good luck! </p>

<p>--&nbsp; <br>According to my limited knowledge, Business schools prefer a supervisor to a colleague as a reference. May I ask you a question: for which type of company you work ? <br>--------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;<br>--&nbsp; 作者：albert<br>--&nbsp; 发布时间：2003-8-19 0:59:00</p>
<p>--&nbsp; <br>in a bank.. I am a lead of a department..<br>I have chosed my supervisor as one of my reference, who is the vice president of my company..</p>
<p>but regarding to another reference, I have two choices.<br>1. the first one is the lead of another department&nbsp; who always cooperate with me and has the same level with me in my company<br>2. the president of my company, who is not so close to me as the first alternative but still keep a pretty good relation with me..</p>
<p>I am wondering that&nbsp; whether I should choose reference letter from vice president and president or reference letter from vice president and one of my colleague..</p>

<p>--&nbsp; <br>one more question, the two reference I am choosing relates to the career of my last two years, when I got a promotion.</p>
<p>I don\'t know whether I should choose a reference relates to the career of my first 3 years before I get a promotion..</p>
<p>thank you so much! <br>--------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;<br>--&nbsp; 作者：lewis<br>--&nbsp; 发布时间：2003-8-19 9:01:00</p>

<p>I am wondering that&nbsp; whether I should choose reference letter from vice president and president or reference letter from vice president and one of my colleague..</p>
<p><br>To me, either is OK. But the later might be safter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don\'t know whether I should choose a reference relates to the career of my first 3 years before I get a promotion..</p>
<p><br>No such need as long as you have two references in your current company.</p>
<p>Keep rolling on!</p>

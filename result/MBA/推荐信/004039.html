<p>--&nbsp; 推荐信多长为好?<br>Hi, any pal cares to help me clarify with the following?</p>
<p>1. How long should the recommendations be?&nbsp; Which style is better, detailed or concise?</p>
<p>2. Should it provide supporting examples for all recommended virtues?&nbsp; How many expamples are enough for each point?</p>
<p>3. Should the two recommenders address different aspects of you? Or should they both emphasize certain strength to make it look more coherent? <br>--------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;<br>--&nbsp; 作者：lewis<br>--&nbsp; 发布时间：2003-10-4 14:08:00</p>

<div class="quote">1. How long should the recommendations be?&nbsp; Which style is better, detailed or concise?</div>
<p>Within 1000 words&nbsp; is prefered. The specific style of the letter depends on the recommender who will write the letter. Either style is acceptable.<br></p>
<div class="quote">2. Should it provide supporting examples for all recommended virtues?&nbsp; How many expamples are enough for each point?</div>
<p>Examples make the points sound. If an example can the point clear, it\'s enough; otherwise, three still make no sense.<br></p>
<div class="quote">3. Should the two recommenders address different aspects of you? Or should they both emphasize certain strength to make it look more coherent?</div>
<p>It depends on what the recommenders think of you. Either is okay. <br>--------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;<br>--&nbsp; 作者：joyoni<br>--&nbsp; 发布时间：2003-10-4 14:15:00</p>
<p>--&nbsp; <br>but i feel that maybe 1000 words is too long to finish reading, i think 600 words is better. <br>--------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;<br>--&nbsp; 作者：tsljz<br>--&nbsp; 发布时间：2003-10-4 20:45:00</p>
<p>--&nbsp; <br>Some experienced people say 1000-1500 words. I believe it depends on the school\'s requirements. Some schools are quite a lot of questions. In that case, you need to provide examples for most of the questions. <br>--------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;<br>--&nbsp; 作者：lukapurple<br>--&nbsp; 发布时间：2003-10-4 21:30:00</p>
<p>--&nbsp; <br>Yes, Columbia asks each recommender 10 questions! <br>--------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;<br>--&nbsp; 作者：joyoni<br>--&nbsp; 发布时间：2003-10-10 3:13:00</p>
<p>--&nbsp; <br>but what if i ask the recommender to write one letter rather than aswer each question of each school?</p>
<p>by the way, which way is better? answering the questions or writing a general letter? <br>--------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;<br>--&nbsp; 作者：chipmunk<br>--&nbsp; 发布时间：2003-10-10 5:05:00</p>
<p>--&nbsp; <br>Answer the question is always the better choice. However it takes more time. <br>--------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;<br>--&nbsp; 作者：valarie<br>--&nbsp; 发布时间：2003-10-10 23:14:00</p>
<p>--&nbsp; <br>I\'ve heard it will be ok as long as your Recom letter is less than 7 pages! <br>--------------------------------------<br>&nbsp;<br>--&nbsp; 作者：zgs<br>--&nbsp; 发布时间：2003-10-10 23:50:00</p>
<p>--&nbsp; <br>I guess that it really depend on the schools. I hear that the recommendation letter shoud be no less than 1 page and each is focused one of your key advantages. Just for your reference. Why not ask the admission office for their advice?</p>
<p>Answering the questions is the best one but most schools understand how busy your recommender is so a letter is quite acceptable. I summarized the common questions from various schools and ask recommender to write only one letter when I applied.&nbsp; </p>

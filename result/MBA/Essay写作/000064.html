<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p><strong>4. Describe a professional experience when you did not live up to your full potential. What would you do differently if you had to do it over again?</strong></p>
<p>Good judgment comes from experience, which, unfortunately, comes from bad judgment. The SystemC was a mammoth project that built a complex integrated system connecting different systems of Bell Canada Enterprise, involving many internal and external teams in the top three IT consulting companies in Toronto. As a positionC, I led a team of X1 from companyC to develop and deliver the integration part of the system. It is a pity that I did not live up to my full potential during the migration. </p>
<p>The mistake was that I did not respond properly when the Data Base Administrator (DBA) team took risks to modify the migration plan to shorten the process under pressure from the clients. The change made some migrated data invalid, which in turn caused a domino effect in the systems. “Whatever can go wrong will.” When the system received invalid data, the potential problems became real problems.&nbsp; If I could do it again, I would collaborate with the DBA team more efficiently to fully understand and correctly calculate the risks. Then I would provide a brief SWOT analysis to the clients and let them know how risky it could be. Once I won support from the clients, I would require the DBA team to stick to the original migration plan to prevent the ad-hoc situation in the first place. </p>
<p>With this tough experience under my belt, I will improve myself to think strategically, communicate persuasively and collaborate efficiently under pressure to face future challenges.</p>

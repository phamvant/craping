<h1 class="aTitle">UC Berkeley (Hass) - Sample Essays - 3</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p><strong><em>Question:</em></strong> What are your professional goals? How do your past and present experiences relate to those goals?</p>
<p>I PICTURE myself PERFORMING a Marketing ROLE in the Media and Entertainment Industry. In the very short term I want to be working with a large M&amp;E company, in charge of a significant division of that business. Among the many sectors available, I have a special interest in the New Media and Media Convergence sectors. But the range of possibilities within the M&amp;E industry is so wide that I would be naive to point one that attracts me the most; I am confident that Haas will provide me with the necessary information and tools for a deeper evaluation of these the segments, allowing me to make my best choice. </p>
<p>Moreover, I wish to hold larger responsibilities. Knowing marketing principles is certainly an advantage in the tremendously competitive scenario we live in, but I need to learn further, I need to improve my General Management Skills to guarantee a successful path towards higher management positions. </p>
<p>In the long term I intend to make a particular dream come true. I will run my own business within this industry, developing an investment fund based on the Cultural Industry in [Country] - a daring dream with potential to transform the [Country] M&amp;E Industry - which has always lacked financial and professional human resources. My work experiences have matched perfectly the Marketing career I designed in the very beginning. I have gathered many different experiences in diverse industries, to experience distinct Marketing realities, which can be applied in most industries. I worked with start-up companies and large multinationals and I have been given the opportunity to cross the traditional boundaries of Marketing touching the General Management field. </p>
<p>I believe choices cannot be motivated by single issues, such as financial rewards, success, pleasure or learning but by a combination of them all. The demanding reality of the business environment in our age, based on fast and increasingly results, can only lead me to a career which will enable me to deliver the expected outcomes and feel absolutely passionate about everyday. Aligning my passions with my job will grant me with a bright and successful future. </p>
<p>Thus, that is the reason I have chosen the Media and Entertainment (M&amp;E) industry, one in which I have been involved during most of my career. From the publishing of [Company 3]'s first CD-ROM in [Country] when I was still a trainee to the promotion of Sports Events for [Company 4] as part of a global Marketing action during the 2000 Olympics. From my involvement with the [deleted] ?the largest music festival in Latin America ?managing its Interactive Communication Strategy to my own personal entrepreneurial venture gathering people for cinema and gastronomy sessions. These are among the experiences I cherish the most, for they are also the most rewarding in my career. My E-commerce graduate course also helped me get involved with M&amp;E since it broadened my mind to the amazing possibilities that will be opened with the convergence of different types of media and the development of new distribution channels in the industry. </p>
<p>Apart from that, my most recent experience at [Company 1] ?though not directly related to the Media &amp; Entertainment industry - provided me with the knowledge of the particularities of Marketing in the Business-to-Business. A knowledge that I will certainly put into practice in the relations with the trade and the distribution segments within the M&amp;E industry. </p>
<p>My decision to follow the M&amp;E industry is also based on the great perspectives and challenges that the segment will face in the next decade. It is a 1.1-trillion-dollar industries experiencing great technological changes which will soon redefine the way people consume information and joy. Development of broadband channels will modify and expand the distribution market; traditional retail chains will confront the growing on-line marketplaces. Analog technologies will be replaced by digital radio and television. Simultaneously, cautious consumers, hesitant advertisers and piracy will temper growth, making it more difficult to implement new business models, models that will require a comprehensive strategic analysis and combination of the economic, cultural, and technological factors that will affect the industry's forecasted average annual growth of 4.8% until 2007. This challenge excites me as much as the opportunity does. It is a risky option. But no other industry could better translate a motto that marked my whole career: NO RISK, NO FUN. </p>

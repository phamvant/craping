<h1 class="aTitle">Leadership品质举例，更新：写leadership经验总结（0109019）</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>[第3页更新]我给同学改文章时,发现大家常常不知道如何升华自己的learning about leadership，写来写去就是坚韧、尊重别人等等……其实leadership的维度很广，层次很深。如下文所述，对leadership的反思，是文章中最关键的message，你所写的action应该充分反映这些message。 这些反思要深刻，要到点子上。<br>所以我从一些关于leadership的论文中摘录一些"leadership"的品质。举一些例子，所谓一个好的leader，他/她应该是怎样的。</p>
<p>建议大家也可以自己做research。例如，你认为confidence很重要，你的优秀品质之一是confident。你可以google一下英文的论文，confidence是什么、来源是什么，对自己和团队有什么影响，为什么一个confident的人更能成为好的leader，一个好的leader好何帮助别人建立confident。这样，如果你写essay时，讲了自己如何帮助别人建立confident的故事，就会成为一篇有深度的essay。</p>
<p>但是，不要生搬硬套。文章的整体逻辑要真实流畅，就是你的反思让人一读，就觉得是可以从这件事情中得到的。</p>
<p>我必须再一次强调，essay is the most critical part of your application, and the understanding of leadership is the critical of the critical。</p>

<p>关于leadership品质的一些总结。我要强调，不要生搬硬套，自己要反思自己到底学到了什么，怎样才算是一个好的leader。（可以这样问问自己，如果我老板有这样的品质，我是否愿意跟着他干。]</p>

<p>What Team Leaders Can Do to Prevent Self-Limiting Behaviors<br>注： Self-limiting指团队中有成员不太engage，因为比方说团队中有的人太强势，或他们不够自信，或者他们觉得自己meanless。</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the meeting beings<br>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choosing the right mix of team members<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduce importance of status (since low-status members defer to high-status)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limit size of teams (large teams suffer from lack of accountability, reduce potential for meaningful contribution)<br>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Framing the team task<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People are more engaged when they understand the importance of the decision<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People increase participation when competing responsibilities are deprioritized<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participation increases when goals are clear, consistent and specific</p>

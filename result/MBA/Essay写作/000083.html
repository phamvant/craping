<h1 class="aTitle">R&amp;D Engineer怎么写Essay？</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>我是做电子研发的，工作来说比较单调。我知道essay在申请中非常重要，对TOP学校的申请几乎起了决定作用。可是我觉得我的工作本身似乎没什么可写的，无法反应出leadership什么的这类东西。虽然也曾被公司派去组织过一两个大型的活动，但那毕竟都不是工作主体，都是临时的。而我工作的本身来讲比较单调，不需要和太多的人打交道，也没有领导过什么（在我们这儿project leader都是40来岁的了，下面N多博士硕士其实都是做普通的工作）</p>
<p>对于这种背景，怎么能突出自己呢？总不能说自己写了多少万行代码，设计了多少万门电路吧。。。感觉比较困惑，怎么才能在这种背景下脱颖而出呢？谁能给点启示？万分感谢！</p>
<p><strong>自己回复自己一下，发现了一篇好文章，不过还是希望大家能指点回答一下我上面的问题。</strong></p>
<p><strong>An engineer's MBA</strong><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>My foray into the industry began as a software engineer. Most MBA applicants have backgrounds in finance/banking/consulting. During my application process, I was confronted with many questions about my background- ranging from "Are engineers at a disadvantage while applying to MBA schools?" to "Does my engineer background help in my MBA?". Simply because, I could not see a one-to-one mapping between what I did at work to the courses and work in an MBA or post MBA. Well, that would make my life tough. Furthermore, bschools do not assess your skills prior to application. I had to rely on business week forums, online research to decide how to confront these questions. After spending a month pouring over these forums and talking to some people, I was relieved. There are several folks who have crossed this path. If you are a software engineer like me, don't be tense. Here are a few guidelines:</p>
<p>1) Beyond Coding/programming/whatever : What have you done that goes beyond coding? I am sure that as an engineer, you are not simply coding in the corner. You have to present,defend and build your ideas. Sometimes, you may have done project management as well. How about process defining, formulation and actually implementing it in a team? Make a list of all such things and think about you will convey these.</p>
<p>2) High level picture: Present a high level picture of the things that you have done. You are the CEO of your own work. Go beyond "developing systems" to thinking about "why this system was built? What role does it play?What's the impact of this system?" and mention those things in your application.</p>
<p>3) IT language: that's a no-no. MBA application is not your project report. Avoid using too much IT talk. Instead of saying "built a client server front end module to retrieve HR database records from some system", use laymen language that is easier to understand. Include other elements of your project. Did you lead a team while doing this project? Did you manage or direct other for their tasks? Now, how about "Managed a team of 3 to develop a HR system with client server functionality".</p>
<p>4) Write those numbers: Did your work improve productivity, caused an increase in sales or revenue, impacted your company positively? Get those stats in your resume. When someone else is reading your resume, these will help them to easily quantify your impact.</p>
<p>5) Communicate well: The general assumption is that engineers are 'ok' or 'not so good' at their verbal skills. If you are not constrained by this assumption, then you should present your application clearly and convincingly. Outside, you might keep yourself out of bschool.</p>
<p>Last, but not the least, being an "XYZ engineer" is your biggest advantage, and will help you to stand out from the pool of i-bankers, consultants, finance specialists applying to b-school. Engineer an articulate and convincing application.</p>

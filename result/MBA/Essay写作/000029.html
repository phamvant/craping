<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p><strong><em>Question:</em></strong> Answer the following five questions.</p>
<p>My passion is to create high-technology products. For the past four years, my work has been extremely fulfilling as I am given opportunities to lead, manage and develop leading edge software products. It is my dream to build a successful company focusing on high technology. </p>
<p>To fulfil this dream, my career plan is to build a solid foundation of project management and people skills, as well as in-depth and broad technical knowledge, with the goal of being a successful entrepreneur by the age of 37. </p>
<p>- If you could have dinner with one individual, past or present, who would it be? Why? </p>
<p>Although my heart says Meg Ryan, my brain decides that I would have dinner with Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs is undoubtedly one of the most charismatic CEO in the computer industry. I respect him for his entrepreneur drive, creativity and success. Two of the companies he co-founded, Apple and Pixar, are innovative leaders in their fields. It would be an enlightening and humbling experience to have dinner with him and I would definitely benefit from the event. </p>
<p>- If you could change one characteristic about yourself, what would it be? </p>
<p>During work, I can be impatient at times; especially when deadlines are tight and the quality of the deliverables are less than expectations. Over the years, I have learnt to moderate my high expectations of others and practice empathy in a sincere and honest way. But I would like to improve this further to the extent that patience is my strength rather than weakness. </p>
<p>- Briefly state what you view as your most significant accomplishment (3 sentences or less). </p>
<p>Between September 2001 and March 2003, I was part of the [deleted] (an overseas IT subsidiary of [deleted] Corporation) management team that: <br>1) Expanded the scale of operation of [deleted] from 70 plus staff to more than 170 staff within 1.5 years.<br>2) Built up the project management and technical expertise of the local teams within 1 year to enable outsourcing of projects from [deleted] Corporation to [deleted] successfully. </p>
<p>- Describe your greatest professional challenge and how you resolved it. </p>
<p>In early 2002, I was tasked to form a product support team within a month (overseas posting), supporting a city-wide shipping community Internet portal. Most of the local employees perceived product support/service as lower value work and shunned such assignments. In this incident, I demonstrated excellent persuasion and leadership skills and was able to recruit a team of 5 willing members. Subsequently, we followed through with a well structured training programme and on-the-job training that build up the expertise of the team within 1 month. Due to the dedication of the assembled team, [deleted] was able to provide the high level technical product support to its valuable customers within the promised deadline. </p>

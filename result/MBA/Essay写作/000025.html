<p>Don't think of another ordinary meal in one of the tons of fancy restaurants in town; instead, picture a cooking spectacle in which I can fully exercise my talent and creativity elaborating a feast. After all, the opportunity to meet someone I deeply admire is a unique occasion. Dinner is served: dishes from all over the world, multiple cultures and references, colors, and aromas! Just as my guest must have wished when he first dreamed about his last project, the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (EPCOT). Walt Disney, the visionary "man behind the magic" who revolutionized the Entertainment Industry with his creativity and entrepreneurial spirit, would be my special invitee. But what to ask a man who created, from a sketch, a 47-billion-dollar company?</p>
<p>The ability of companies to innovate is, in my opinion, one of the most critical issues involved in competitiveness. Thus, if this event had subtitles, they would read: "How have you nurtured an organizational culture where new ideas are expressed and stimulated, fostering a climate of creativity in which new concepts are propelled from creation to implementation?" Next, I would explore his talent of salesman. "How can I develop your kind of ability to convince not only professional investors but also my employees to believe and drop their dollars into risky ideas? How would you translate your most famous quote ?"If you can dream, you can do it" ?into practical actions?" After all, who would have estimated the ROI of the production of the first animated feature-length film (Snow White) back in 1934? Finally, after serving dessert, I would like to have his tips for me to develop a truly entrepreneurial attitude. </p>

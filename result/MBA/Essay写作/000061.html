<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p><strong>1. Discuss your personal and professional development over the past five years and describe how these changes have led you to choose to do your MBA at this time. What are your career goals and how will a Rotman MBA help you to achieve them?</strong></p>
<p>To me, life is like a round of golf. To win, I have to think two or three moves ahead every time I hit the ball. Before every move, I have to ask myself, “Where do I need to put this ball to make my next shot as easy as possible?” This time the answer is to land a MBA to earn a birdie in the next hole of my life.</p>
<p>After discovering that software can improve our lives significantly, I became passionate about this industry. My working experiences as a postionA at CompanyA and as a positionBC at both CompanyB and CompanyC prove that technology alone cannot guarantee the success of a project, however. As a key contributor to a project called projectC at CompanyC, I was excited by the cutting-edge technology used in the project. The project ended up aborted, however, because it was not financially and strategically aligned with the customer’s business goals. This experience strengthened my belief that I have to combine business skills with technical knowledge to succeed. Thus, I realize that I need to pursue a MBA to acquire core business skills, such as finance, operations, and business strategy, to be more solid in my career. </p>
<p>In my personal life, relativeD's 4-month hospital stay after surgery for sugeryD brought the health care industry to my attention. Fascinated by how essential the health care system is in our society and surprised by how primitive health care information systems are, I landed the position of positionD at D. In the short term, I need a MBA program that can accelerate the switch to this industry by providing better understanding of management in health care systems in Canada. My long-term career goal is to transform the health care system into a quality-centered system with information technology by leading the orgnizationD in D. </p>
<p>At Rotman, the integrative thinking approach will transform my way of thinking so I can think through the complexities of the health care service and drive action in a quickly-changing industry. In addition, the health sector management concentration at Rotman provides courses such as “Health Sector Strategy and Organization,” ”Health Care Marketing” and “Health Care Systems” that will analyze and develop a working knowledge of the health care system in the Canadian context; thus, the Rotman program will give me a better understanding of health care systems in Canada.&nbsp; Furthermore, the balanced academic approach using case studies and lectures appealed to me after my class visit to Rotman. Finally, after interacting with Rotman students, I know that I will be surrounded by incredibly motivated individuals with whom I can form life-long friendships.</p>
<p>Aiming strategically, I am ready to tee off in the next hole of my life. With work, life and study to balance, I know there are bunkers and hazards along the fairway. By making every shot count, I am confident that I will earn a birdie.</p>

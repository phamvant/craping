One of the Rotman School's underlying principles is the value of one; this value reflects the belief that each member of the Rotman community has unique needs and talents. What are your greatest talents and/or abilities and how would each enhance the experience of your classmates?</strong></p>
<p>We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give. With more than X1 years experience in different industries including banks, retailing, telecom and healthcare in both Canada and China, I am confident that I have a lot to contribute to the Rotman community. </p>
<p>In year X2, I started a brand new departmentA as a manager at CompanyA by quickly building a X3-person team from scratches. Target-oriented, I led my team and successfully fulfilled revenue of US$X4M, US$X5M more than the revenue target of the year. With my leadership and collaborative skills, I would like to share professional experiences with women and promote women in all aspects of business and management. Now as a working mom of a 3-years-old, I deeply understand how important to empower women either at work or in personal life. I have the desire to make a difference and to improve the lives of women.</p>
<p>In addition, my passion and vision about the software industry will add value to my classmate by leveraging technology in businesses. Furthermore, with more than X6 years working experience at both companyB and companyC, I would like to share my insights about IT consulting field with my classmates. Finally, I hope that my international experience can bridge the cultural gap between Asia and Canada in the classroom. </p>
<p>At the same time, I will proactively learn from other talented Rotman students. Individually, I am one drop. Rotman community together, we are an ocean.</p>

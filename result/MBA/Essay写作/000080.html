<blockquote>
<h4>One MBA, Two Paths</h4>
<p>Columbia Business School provides students with the option of enrolling in either September or January. Students who enroll in September are presented with an internship option after their first year of studies. Students who do not want or need an internship may consider beginning their MBA studies in January and taking their second term during the summer. A January start may be ideal for students who wish to remain in the same industry after graduation or pursue entrepreneurial interests.</p>
<p>The two paths, each comprised of four semesters, merge in the fall of the second year of studies to complete the program of electives. The paths are identical in terms of competitiveness of admissions, academic rigor and student resources.</p>

<h4>Early Decision</h4>
<p>The Early Decision option is ideal for candidates who have completed their research about MBA programs and have decided that Columbia is the school they want to attend. Early Decision applications are reviewed before Regular Decision applications. </p>
<p><em></em>Early Decision candidates must sign the following Statement of Commitment:</p>
<blockquote>As an Early Decision candidate to Columbia Business School, I understand that if I am admitted I will submit my nonrefundable $6,000 deposit to secure my place in the September entering class. <strong>I am committed to attending Columbia Business School and will withdraw all applications and decline all offers from other schools upon admission to Columbia Business School.</strong></blockquote>
<p>Early Decision applicants will find the Statement of Commitment in the Honor System section of the online application.</p>
<p><strong>Early Decision candidates who are offered admission have up to two weeks to submit their nonrefundable $6,000 deposit.</strong> Applicants who are not yet ready for this level of commitment are encouraged to apply for Regular Decision.</p>
<h4>Deadlines</h4>
<p>Columbia Business School uses a rolling admissions process. Applications are reviewed in the order in which they are received, and decisions can be rendered at any point during the review period. It is <em>always</em> to your benefit to apply before the posted deadline. </p>

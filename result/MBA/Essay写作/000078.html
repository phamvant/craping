<h4>Slide Presentation</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>In four slides or less please answer the following question: What have you not already shared in your application that you would like your future classmates to know about you?</p>
<p>We have set forth the following guidelines for you to consider when creating your presentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The content is completely up to you. There is no right or wrong approach to this essay. </li>
<li>Feel free to use the software you are most comfortable with. Acceptable formats for upload in the online application system are PowerPoint or PDF. </li>
<li>There is a strict maximum of 4 slides, though you can provide fewer than 4 if you choose.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Slides will be printed and added to your file for review, therefore, flash, hyperlinks, embedded videos, music, etc. will not be viewed by the committee. You are limited to text and static images to convey your points. Color may be used. </li>
<li>Slides will be evaluated on the quality of content and ability to convey your ideas, not on technical expertise or presentation. </li>
<li>You are welcome to attach a document containing notes if you feel a deeper explanation of your slides is necessary. However the hope is the slide is able to stand alone and convey your ideas clearly. You will not be penalized for adding notes but you should not construct a slide with the intention of using the notes section as a consistent means of explanation.</li></ul></blockquote>
<h4>Optional Essay</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is any important information that is relevant for your candidacy that you were unable to address elsewhere in the application, please share that information here.</p></blockquote>

(Limit response to 500 words, double spaced)</p>
<p>When I left [Undergrad University], I took a position in consulting. It was during my time in consulting that I gained first-hand knowledge of the technology industry. Before entering the field, I was assigned to the Test Engineering team in our Product Development department, where being entrenched in product development forced me to learn the technology inside-out. This rock-solid base in technology allowed me to succeed at client sites, and I had the opportunity to demonstrate leadership potential in two key roles ?both technical leads of portal implementations.</p>
<p>With several years experience in consulting, I moved to Product Marketing and brought my unique customer-focused experience from the field. Starting as a Marketing Programs Manager and later promoted to Product Marketing Manager, I was responsible for creating product positioning and developing, executing and managing product launches. When I joined the team, the product we had recently introduced was failing.<br>Backed by executive commitment, our team implemented several initiatives to increase product revenues. We worked with regional teams to execute demand generation campaigns and attend events. We worked with business development to broaden industry partnerships and support, while engaging our analyst relations team to get face time with renowned and respected market analysts and convert them to our approach. We analyzed purchase behavior, and I presented our findings to 1,000 resellers to teach them how to increase their revenues through our product. Ultimately product revenues and subscription rates grew by a factor of fifteen.</p>
<p>Recently promoted, my new responsibilities comprise of managing a team of three individuals who develop and implement strategies to effectively market to, and communicate with, our training customers and partners. Additionally, our team is responsible for delivering and maintaining the integrity of certification programs. Overall, I'm proud of my career progress ?I've received four promotions in four years. Part of my success can be attributed to hard work and determination, but much of it is due to great managers who've helped guide and develop me along my desired career path.</p>
<p>Largely, the choices I've made in my career path have been guided by my end goals, which have gradually become tighter in definition as I've matured professionally. When I began my career, I knew that I wanted to influence how people think and someday manage a large team. At first I thought that I could influence others through consulting, primarily through making positive changes at client organizations. After some time, I found that the brief nature of our engagements kept me from seeing the impact of our work. Still keeping sight of my end goals, I decided to alter my path by going into marketing, and leveraging my background to bring unique talents to the team.</p>
<p>My most recent move, accepting the promotion to External Operations Manager for [Company 1], is allowing me to build my managerial skills while continuing to work with marketing and communications. I've discovered that marketing is indisputably my calling for influencing others, and I am working towards learning how to effectively manage people. </p>

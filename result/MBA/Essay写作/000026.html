<p>One year ago I called a meeting with [Company 1]'s commercial team to present my new Direct Marketing campaign and wrap up final implementation details. I was excited: the company had never approved such an innovative idea. My excitement contaminated the team so thoroughly that they wanted to implement it quickly and unconditionally. My IMPULSIVENESS was almost blinding my reasoning when I suddenly remembered an occasion when the same impulsiveness brought me a big headache. Years before, as a trainee at [Company 2], I had to launch a promotion that could be a real blast. Torpid by my impulsiveness, however, I simply forgot that our recently hired bread vendor might not be prepared for a fast increase in sales. The campaign itself was a hit, but when we ordered the extra necessary bread supply, the brand new vendor simply said: "I am sorry guys, terribly sorry! Even working under full capacity I cannot cover your needs. I lack personnel to handle the packaging section". I started cold sweating. I pictured the guy behind the counter, "Pardon me, customer. We are out of bread". Terrified at this possibility, I immediately gathered a team and there we went to the vendor's packaging section to help the supplier (and me) to deliver the product. We worked overnight and fortunately guaranteed that no customer hear the infamous apology.</p>
<p>Back to [Company 1], I interrupted the meeting and suggested that we implement the direct marketing action according to our commercial team's capacity to follow up the prospects. As predicted, the piece provided a return of over 60%, far outweighing the market average of 3%. Impulsiveness can get the engines running, but today, whenever I make an important decision, I resort to an ancient Roman poet, "Grant us a brief delay; impulse in everything is but a worthless servant." </p>

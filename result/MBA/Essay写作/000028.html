<p>It's tough to launch a new brand. Now picture how much tougher it can get to re-launch a wounded brand. [Company A] represented a huge challenge for any Marketing professional, for its brief history in the [Country] market had been all trouble. A combination of a mistaken brand positioning, a high price point, and intensive competition had forced their withdrawal from the market in less than 2 years. At the time I started working with [Company A], a customer's perception towards the brand was probably, "Well, you know, those guys don't offer the traditional Italian pizza and charge way above any pizza place on every corner". Thus, my challenge was to reintroduce [Company A] in [Country], breaking all misconceptions that customers had. The solution was a customer-centric Marketing Strategy based on consumer behavior analysis and surveys which I conducted. Through this strategy I decided which of [Company A]'s products could and could not be in the Market and what message to deliver in order to please the customer.</p>
<p>I changed the focus of the old operation thoroughly, redefined the target group (from adults to young adults) and repositioned the brand to the delivery-only market, avoiding the intensive competition of the whole market. I set up more competitive prices and decided not to simply import the products and concepts from the US, but rather adapt the product to the regional characteristics and customers' expectations. Today, a customer perception towards the brand is much different, "Man, these guys rock, there's no better pizza to ask at home. It's always delivered hot and crispy, way different from ordinary pizzas." I am proud to see that, through a customer-oriented strategy I was able to change the customer's perception, set new quality standards, and sediment the base for a consistent and effective growth of what today is a 30-store chain in the [Country] Market. It was also a truly entrepreneurial venture in which we made dough from flour, literally. </p>

<h1 class="aTitle">Sample Essay: Chicago - 2</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p><strong>Question: Why are you seeking an MBA? What are your plans and goals after your receive your degree? (500 words)</strong></p>
<p>Having been a management consultant for nearly three years, addressing business issues in four industries, for seven clients, in five countries, I can confirm that I want to return to that field, but I also want to rank among the most senior executives at Fortune 500 companies. While I remain open to opportunities I may discover at the GSB, my present goal is to become a partner in a professional services consulting firm. To accelerate my achievement of that goal, I would like to complete a concentration in Strategic Management at the GSB. </p>
<p>Fundamentally, I seek the toolkit that will enable me to counter a complex business problem with a creative, outside-the-box solution. And when I can't come up with a solution on my own, I will need to assemble and effectively collaborate with a team that can. An MBA will give me the skills I need to develop my own innovative solutions, to recognize the talent I want on my team, and to lead even the most diverse group to success. </p>
<p>In the short term, the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business (GSB) will provide me with unparalleled analytical skills. While I believe my undergraduate major in Finance has served me well thus far in my consulting career, I need more rigorous quantitative coursework to develop the analytical skills required for solving more challenging business problems. In addition, I look to the GSB to help me become a more effective manager. For example, I expect to implement such principles as set forth in the LEAD program as the managerial groundwork, the feedback approach, and the teamwork principles it sets forth. Therefore, the near-term reason for seeking an MBA is to enhance my analytical and managerial skills. </p>
<p>Now, as a woman with clear career and family goals, timing of the pursuit of an MBA is everything. I do not have the luxury of "letting things fall into place". If I wish a family and a career, I have to move swiftly, with conviction. I recognize this year as the right time for me for three reasons. First, I have gained extensive and varied work experience that will allow me to contribute in the classroom, as well as benefit from others' experiences. Secondly, I am no longer convinced that I can achieve my long-term career objectives within my company, given the changing focus of the company toward such areas as outsourcing and away from strategic consulting work. Finally, an MBA is a critical part of my personal development plan to constantly challenge myself by pursuing learning opportunities beyond those I have already encountered. </p>

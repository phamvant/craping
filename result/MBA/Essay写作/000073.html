<p></p>
<p>Please note that each "round" represents a distinct period in which you may apply, not a succession of steps for your application. You may apply in one round only, one time in an application year.</p>
<p>Given past experience, we anticipate that many candidates will submit their online application materials very close to 5 p.m. on submission deadline dates. <strong>To avoid heavy server traffic and potential delays, we encourage candidates to submit application materials as early as possible.</strong></p>
<p>Applications received after 5 p.m. on October 1, 2009 will be considered in Round 2. Applications received after 5 p.m. on January 19, 2010 will be considered in Round 3. Applications received after 5 p.m. on April 8, 2010 will not be considered.</p>
<p>Regretfully, requests for decisions earlier than the notification dates listed above cannot be accommodated under any circumstances.</p>
<h2>When Should I Apply?</h2>
<p>To avoid overwhelming server traffic generated by the high volume of applications we receive, candidates are encouraged to submit their application as early as possible prior to the deadline of each round.</p>
<p>We encourage applicants to apply in the first or second round, as space in the class may be limited by the third round. In addition, applying in the earlier rounds will give candidates more time to address the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>International candidates needing visas will find that applying in round 3 makes the timing of their visa application stressful. </li>
<li>International candidates admitted in rounds 1 and 2 find that it's helpful to have the additional time to work on English proficiency. </li>
<li>Some candidates may be required to complete preliminary course work prior to their enrollment. </li>
<li>Many deadlines for outside (non-Harvard Business School) fellowships are in early spring. Only students who have been accepted are eligible for these fellowships. </li>
<li>Financial aid is available regardless of when students are admitted. However, since admitted students may apply for financial aid only after they are admitted round 3 admits have <em>less time</em> to prepare their application. </li>
<li>Harvard Business School residence halls and Harvard University-affiliated apartments are assigned by lottery. Deadlines for both of these housing options precede Round 3 notification, and you must be admitted to HBS before you can enter these lotteries</li></ul>
<h2>Application Components</h2>
<p>The application for the MBA Class of 2012 consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Responses to the four application essay questions (see below) </li>
<li>Current resume </li>
<li>Three recommendations (must be submitted online) </li>
<li>Self-reported transcripts from all undergraduate and graduate academic institutions attended (full- or part-time) </li>
<li>GMAT or GRE scores from a test taken January 1, 2005 or later (and TOEFL IBT or IELTS score, if applicable, from a test taken January 1, 2008 or later) </li>
<li>Signed HBS Community Values statement </li>
<li>Signed Statement of Application Integrity </li>
<li>Nonrefundable U.S. $250 application fee (credit card only)* </li>

<p>The School will verify application information and reserves the right to withdraw any offer of admission already made if there is any discrepancy between the self-reported information and information provided through verification.</p>

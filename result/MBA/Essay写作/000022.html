Please note this essay is intended to get a sense of your personality and potential contribution to the Fuqua culture. (Limit response to 750 words)</p>
<p>Often, people make judgments about others based upon perceptions and assumptions rather than taking the time to get to know them. When some people think of me, I imagine that they see my color, education, and outward appearance, but those factors say little to nothing about who I am. I am more than just a Black man. I am more than just a [school 1] and [school 2] alumnus. I am more than just a [detailed physical description]. I am a man characterized by his grounded nature, desire to be a role model, openness, and focus and I plan to use these traits to contribute to the experiences of my future classmates at the Fuqua School of Business.</p>
<p>"I'm from the [country] where everybody is broke, 'ya dig But that don't mean I'mma turn my back on my folks, 'ya dig" - Juvenile (of The Hot Boys), "'Ya dig" </p>
<p>I grew up in a rural area in Virginia. When I was young, I always felt like the underdog because of my small size, shyness, and humble financial status. Since leaving my hometown, this mindset has allowed me to remain grounded and has motivated me to become involved in a variety of activities that many of my peers would not consider. For example, one of my organizations, [deleted], solicits its members on a weekly basis to work at a soup kitchen for homeless women at a church in Washington DC. Many members decline this opportunity because of the menial nature of the work or because they consider the task to be beneath them, but my background gives me a different view of things. While I was growing up, my family struggled financially and there were times when I feared we would lose our home. Remembering those fears makes me identify with the women who frequent the soup kitchen and motivates me to volunteer my time with the program as regularly as I can. </p>
<p>While growing up, the majority of my family and friends were either in strictly blue-collar or non-business/technical careers, so I did not have many role models in my pursuit of higher education and success in business and technology. Now, I feel that it is my duty to be a role model and positive influence in the lives of others to share the benefits of the blessings that have been bestowed upon me. </p>
<p>"My peoples all shapes and colors?My peoples will always remain, Remain with a story to tell" - DJ Jazzy Jeff featuring Raheem, "My People" </p>
<p>I really enjoy interacting with people from different backgrounds. Before entering [school 1], I had primarily interacted with only Caucasian- and African-Americans, so I held many misconceptions about people who came from different backgrounds. I made assumptions based on stereotypes and stories that I had heard and believed those assumptions to be factual. [school1] provided my first experience with diverse groups of people and I was amazed at how much and how quickly I learned from my classmates. Since then, I focused on meeting a variety of people and finding out what they have to offer. I believe that everyone has an interesting story to tell, so I do not discriminate when it comes to meeting others. I look at people in terms of their strength of character and personality rather than their color, education, occupation, or intellect. I am as likely to have a meaningful conversation with a janitor as I am to have one with a Nobel laureate. To me, every new friend represents a chance for a new learning experience, so I try to associate with as diverse a group of people as possible. </p>
<p>"I'm focused, man" - Jay-Z, "Best of Me (remix)" </p>
<p>Once I set a goal for myself, I become completely driven to achieve that aim. Whether pursuing a graduate degree while working full-time, volunteering at a soup kitchen, or improving my play on the basketball court, I devote as much attention as possible to the cause before me. At times, it can be challenging to remain focused on a variety of activities. However, especially after attending graduate school and working simultaneously, I have learned to maintain a balance amongst achieving all of my goals and spending time with my family and friends. </p>

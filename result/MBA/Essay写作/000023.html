(Limit response to 500 words)</p>
<p>In 1992, I saw a movie called "The Lawnmower Man" and, while the movie's plot line was less than impressive, its special effects captivated me. The colors, animation, and computer graphics were unlike anything I'd ever seen before. At that point, my love for technology was born. Over the next three years, I took each Computer Science class offered by my high school. Before I even began college, I knew my career interests lay in technology. When I sat down to watch that movie, I had no idea that it would have any lasting effects on my life, but it indirectly has led to my career choice.</p>
<p>Both my educational and professional experiences have not only increased my technical competency, but also prepared me to meet my long-term career goal of being a senior executive in a technology-oriented company. My undergraduate studies in Computer Science at [deleted] University provided the theoretical basis for embarking upon a career in software development. Working as a Software Developer at [Company 1], a technology consultancy that developed eBusinesses for companies in industries, ranging from telecommunication to major league sports, cultivated my Java programming skills. My final assignment at [Company 1] was as a member of the team that created MLB.com, which proved to be very rewarding. I started that assignment by designing and implementing a back-end messaging system that drove online ticket sales for MLB.com. Then, I transitioned into the Quality Assurance Testing lead for instances of my team's components at four major league baseball teams. In this role, I was able to work directly with our client's senior management in addition to employing my technical abilities. </p>
<p>Since joining [Company 2] as a Software Engineer on its Department of Defense (DoD) Metadata Registry project team, I have been able to gain intimate knowledge of each stage of the software development lifecycle, including requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, and deployment. Initially, my work focused strictly on Java development, but, three months later, I began designing back-end software components of the system. After a year on the project, I accepted the role of Release Manager, which exposed me to post-implementation testing and deployment activities. Four months ago, I accepted an additional role as Requirements Manager and have been involved with the in-depth analysis of system requirements that had previously been handled by the team's technical lead. This practical experience in academic and professional software development has given me an understanding of the processes that are necessary to build a technology product from start to finish. This understanding will be of critical strategic importance as I continue to develop the skills necessary to lead a major technology organization. </p>
<p>As I look toward the future, I am confident that my studies and work experience have combined to create the strong foundation of domain knowledge that I can build upon to reach my goal of leading a technology-focused company. </p>

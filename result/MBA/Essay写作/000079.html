<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>by Bruce<br><a href="http://blogs.som.yale.edu/">http://blogs.som.yale.edu/</a></p>
<p>Despite the common assumption that summers are quiet in academia, June came and went with a flurry of activity here in admissions. The month included lots of outreach and events, starting on the 1st with our first Consortium Orientation Program in Charlotte and ending just last Friday when SOM concluded its inaugural two-week Pre-MBA Leadership Program here on campus (the purpose of which is to expose college students and early professionals who are committed to diversity and inclusion to the possibilies of an MBA education).&nbsp; In between, there was the GMAC Annual Industry Conference, the Forte Foundation Annual Meeting, and meetings with Womensphere, StartingBloc, and a number of other partner organizations.&nbsp; It was a very busy month, and the Consortium OP and Pre-MBA Program in particular were notable as indicative of the importance of diversity here at SOM.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve had a chance to take a quick breath from all these events, I wanted to do a quick post to announce our 2009-2010 application deadlines and essay topics.&nbsp; Here they are:</p>

<li>A central premise of our teaching about leadership at the Yale School of Management is that true leadership—leadership that helps to address a significant problem in a new way—is necessarily personal. It is only when personal passion aligns with meaningful aspirations that individuals are able to inspire others to act in support of an important goal or cause. What are you most passionate about, and how have you demonstrated a commitment to this passion? 
</li><li>What achievement are you most proud of and why? 
</li><li>What is the most difficult feedback you have received from another person or the most significant weakness you have perceived in yourself? What steps have you taken to address it and how will business school contribute to this process? 
</li><li>Describe a situation in which you devised and implemented a creative or unique solution to a difficult problem. What obstacles did you face and how did you overcome them? 
</li><li>Required for reapplicants: What steps have you taken to improve your candidacy since your last application?</li></ol>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (OPTIONAL)</strong></p>
<p>If any aspect of your candidacy needs further explanation, please provide any additional information that you would like the Admissions Committee to consider. (250 words maximum)</p>
<p>I hope this information’s helpful to anyone who wants to get a jump on their SOM application.&nbsp; We will be posting our summer/fall recruiting schedule shortly and the application itself should be live in early August.&nbsp; We will be sure to let everyone know when those things happen.&nbsp; In the meantime, happy writing!</p>

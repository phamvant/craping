<p>Introduction to the Southern Dialect </p>
<p>Given the possibility that I, a Southerner, may attend the GSB next year, I can think of no more helpful information to provide the admissions committee than a guide to the Southern dialect. After all, it would be awkward for all involved if I were to arrive on campus only to find that no one could understand me. Therefore, I hope to acquaint the admissions committee with "Southern Speak" through this essay. Below, in an attempt to prevent bewildered stares, I will give you a short "dictionary" of some favorite Southern words. </p>
<p>"Y'all"<br>Ironically, "y'all" is the Southern word most ridiculed by those above the Mason-Dixon Line, yet, by my observation, is also the most quickly adopted of all Southern words. "Y'all" tends to receive criticism for its grammatical impropriety, but I can not, for the life of me, figure out why. "Y'all" is the conjunction of you and all. It provides an effective means of distinguishing when one is addressing more than one person (i.e., "Are y'all responsible for deciding who is admitted to the GSB?"). "Y'all" is gaining popularity throughout the United States, in part thanks to Southern rappers like Nelly and Outkast. Like Nelly and OutKast before me, I will do my part to extend the reach of "y'all" to the greater Chicago area if granted admission to the GSB. Yonder<br>"Yonder" is a noun that represents a place. If you replace the word "yonder" with "there" in the following sentence, you are sure to understand its meaning: "Are y'all going over yonder tonight?" I expect to have to use this word a great deal upon setting foot on the Hyde Park campus, so I want there to be no confusion about its meaning. For example, "Is Dr. Fama's class in that building over yonder? Edelstone is over yonder, right? Did y'all see Gwyneth Paltrow filming a scene over yonder?" See what I mean? </p>
<p>Grits<br>"Grits" really has two meanings. The first is a Southern breakfast food made from small, broken grains of corn. The second, GRITS, is an acronym meaning Girls Raised In The South. Grits ?the food ?are relatively bland until mixed with A LOT of butter and cheese. GRITS, however, are definitely not bland and mix well in most situations (such as in a cohort at the GSB next fall).</p>
<p>And that's all, y'all!<br>So there you have it ?an introduction to the Southern dialect. Thank you for taking the time to get to know my fun side. I hope to meet y'all up yonder next September, perhaps over a breakfast of eggs, bacon and grits! </p>

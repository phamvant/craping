<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p><strong><em>Question:</em></strong> What are your short and long term career goals once you earn your MBA? Why are you interested in the Fuqua School of Business and how will The Duke MBA help you reach your goals?</p>
<p>My career aspiration is to be a Senior Vice President of Marketing for a large enterprise, or a medium enterprise with significant growth potential. Ideally, I will manage marketing, including demand generation, communications, analyst interactions and press relations, and integrate the marketing function into a cohesive strategy for the entire organization. However, management is only part of my aspiration; I also want to build a team of professionals with great potential and help develop each person to the best of his or her abilities. Success will be assessed in two parts ?the first element will be dependent on the success of the organization overall. The second element will occur after I am Senior VP, as the team of individuals each go on to achieve his or her goals. </p>
<p>Before becoming a Senior VP of Marketing, I look forward to continuing my career path as Marketing Manager in gradually more challenging roles, moving towards Senior Manager and Director. Hopefully, these roles will combine supervising more people and directing larger marketing campaigns and efforts. Important short-term goals for me are to seek out opportunities to learn more about management and to build relationships with successful marketing leaders.</p>
<p>To realize my aspirations, I will need core skills in marketing that I do not possess today. Much of my experience is practical, and gained through "trial-by-fire". Missing from my education are the foundational marketing concepts and theories upon which practical experience is built, as well as the basics of business essential to performing as an executive. I strongly believe that an MBA is the right way for me to gain this knowledge. Just as there is no substitute for experience, there is no substitute for the classroom environment. In this atmosphere, I'll have the opportunity to gain an unparalleled competency in marketing and business. However, theoretical knowledge is only one requirement. To realize my goals I'll also need to develop my potential as a leader ?which is why I'm applying to Fuqua School of Business. The school employs the techniques necessary to teach students how to observe and act on the world ?positively impacting those around them. The reason why I am pursuing an MBA now is because I am nearing a plateau in my personal development. I've had the chance to learn much about leadership through experience, such as the necessity of commitment, prioritization and coming together as a cohesive group. Continuing in this vein, my new position is providing me the chance to learn how to be a great manager of tasks and people, but I'll need more to achieve my ambitions. I look to an MBA to help move me from marketing manager to organization leader.</p>

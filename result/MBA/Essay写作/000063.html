<h1 class="aTitle">U of T, Rotman MBA essay - 3</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p><strong>3. Imagine that ten years from now a colleague is describing you to a new employee. What will s/he say about you that you are not known for now? How will you achieve these new skills?</strong></p>
<p>“She can build models of the ‘big picture’ by putting together the jigsaw pieces of a complex business problem. By implementing the best model that resolves tensions, she turns challenges into opportunities. She contributes significantly to transforming the Ontario health care system into a quality-centered and technology-powered system by successfully combining skills in finance, strategic management and operation management with those in information technologies.” My colleague will introduce me with the above comments.&nbsp; </p>
<p>On one hand, I will pursue a MBA at Rotman to achieve these new skills in integrative thinking, finance, strategy management and operation management. The more I read about Rotman, the more I am excited by Rotman’s revolutionary hallmark of integrative thinking. In addition, Rotman’s pioneering curriculum in health sector management will prepare me to advance my career in the health sector. </p>
<p>On the other hand, as a part-time student, I will apply the new skills I learn in class to my current job immediately. In my current job as a positionD at D, I often feel overwhelmed by ambiguous business problems with incomplete and uncertain information. By using real business problems as study cases, I will hone my new skills in my real work.</p>
<p>Believing in learning by doing and thinking before doing, I will keep practicing those skills in my career, and acquiring new skills whenever necessary. I am today where my wills have brought me, and I will be tomorrow where my wills take me.</p>

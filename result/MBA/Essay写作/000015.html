<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p><strong>Question: If you could be present at any event in time, what would it be and why? (500 words)</strong></p>
<p>"You can have anything you want - if you want it badly enough. You can be anything you want to be, have anything you desire, accomplish anything you set out to accomplish - if you will hold to that desire with singleness of purpose." ?General Robert E. Lee </p>
<p>"One of my superstitions had always been when I started to go anywhere, or to do anything, not to turn back, or stop until the thing intended was accomplished." ?General Ulysses S. Grant </p>
<p>These are two very different approaches to making things happen, and two very different men made the statements. General Robert E. Lee was the leader of the Confederate forces which championed slavery. General Ulysses S. Grant served as leader of the Union forces which refused to allow the bigotry to spread any further. If given the opportunity to be present at any event in time, I would choose General Robert E. Lee's surrender to General Ulysses S. Grant on April 9, 1865 at Appomatox Court House, Virginia. From the quotes above, both Generals placed high value on accomplishments, as do I. At this event, however, only one of the Civil War's two most reputable leaders could claim victory. <br>Most leadership skills must be learned through observation and experience rather than through books or independent study. Being present at this event would allow me to witness the leadership of one phenomenal U.S. leader in his time of triumph and another in his greatest defeat, as well as the lessons the Generals learned in the process. <br>A lesser man than Lee would have crumbled under the pressure of defeat; instead Lee accepted his fate with humility and embraced the ensuing change with poise. A lesser man than Grant would have wallowed in pride, but he shared Lee's trait of humility as evidenced by the Union's compassionate reception of Lee's surrender. Though remembered very differently in U.S. history, these two Generals clearly have much in common. Even more than grace and humility, though, the two share some of the most difficult traits to learn: the ability to inspire, gain trust and ultimately influence action.<br>Influencing action has been critical in my most recent role as a spend category sourcing lead for a broad strategic sourcing effort. I had to use influence and gain trust to motivate two executive-level client team members to meet an aggressive timeline and identify substantial savings. Though certainly no Appomatox Court House, my success in this role is a favorite work accomplishment, because it's given me self-confidence and faith in my leadership abilities.<br>Ultimately, I hope to adopt many more of the leadership characteristics possessed by Lee and Grant in my leadership style. I will strive to inspire and motivate others, to be compassionate, and to accept defeat as graciously as I embrace victory. If I were present on that day at the McLean House in Appomatox, I know I would benefit from observing all of those and more in these two gifted leaders. </p>

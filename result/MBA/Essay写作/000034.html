<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p><strong><em>QUESTION:</em></strong> Describe a situation where you introduced and/or managed change in an organization. Tell us how you influenced others in an organization (business, school, extracurricular activity) and comment on the professional and/or personal attributes you used to do that and how these attributes (and others) might be important in the attainment of your career goals. How do you expect to further the development of these attributes at the MIT Sloan School of Management? </p>
<p>When I was in rural Japan in the summer of [deleted], I felt like Superman in a country full of Kryptonite. Sent to southern tip of the southern-most island of Japan to manage the SAP implementation for [deleted] as an [deleted] consultant, I was responsible for implementing business process changes in a country where I did not speak the language. I had lost my power to communicate. The business managers with whom I had to work had a conflicted view of me. On one hand, they viewed me positively because I was instructing them how to use the new tools to do their jobs. At the same time, they resented me because I was directing them to do tasks in unfamiliar ways. </p>
<p>So how did I thrive? Four critical attributes enabled me to make that engagement a success: perseverance, patience, the capacity to listen, and the ability to manage and work with people who were different than me. </p>
<p>Perhaps no day typified the challenges I faced better than the first day of "go-live," which came two weeks into my six-week stay. On [deleted], we stopped all 57 global computer systems used by [deleted] and converted the entire company to SAP. Such installations are notorious for their complexity, as every part of the business is changed at the same time. The Japanese distribution center, which usually shipped 1500 packages a day, shipped a grand total of six packages that day. Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. Bar codes did not scan. Book-to-physical inventory discrepancies hidden in the old systems appeared. SAP configuration that had been tested and tested now malfunctioned. </p>
<p>While I had the SAP knowledge, I could not readily communicate it to my Japanese counterparts, and they could not explain their issues to me. Resolving each challenge required dedicated listening and patience. Frequently, the problem was a process change mandated by SAP, which required me to design a solution with the Japanese warehouse supervisor through a combination of verbal communication, written drawings, and hand signals. </p>
<p>Slowly, but surely, we got that distribution center working. Within three weeks, we made more shipments than ever before in that warehouse ľ 1700 in one day. Through the strength of global teamwork, patience, and perseverance, we realized our return on the SAP investment as well as a great sense of accomplishment. </p>
<p>A company's success is defined by its people. As a chief executive, I will need to motivate my team and ensure each person feels important. Patience, listening, and the ability to appreciate different viewpoints are required for managerial success. The rigor of a Sloan education demands both teamwork and trust in your teammates. These are critical lessons for every manager. At times, as the leader of my Sloan team, I will manage the overall project and delegate assignments. Other times, as a team member, I will contribute toward our end goal. Practicing teamwork in an educational environment offers the opportunity for analysis and introspection. Due to the hectic pace of the business world, it is difficult to find the time to examine the inner workings of a team. Studying for two years at Sloan will enable me to study team dynamics and reflect on my role as both a leader and a participant of a team.</p>

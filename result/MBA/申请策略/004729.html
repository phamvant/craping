<p>Happy Holidays! As the year comes to an end and the round two application deadline approaches, we know you are at different stages in the admissions process. To spread some holiday cheer, we’d like to share with you a couple of tips that you might find helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Tip #1 – Interview Preparation</strong><br>For those of you who have already applied, we are still in the process of reviewing applications. If you are invited to interview, please remember that the interview is an opportunity for you to tell us more about yourself, your background, and your career aspirations. The majority of our interviews are conducted by trained second-year students. Interviewers will not have read your application before the interview – they will only have reviewed your resume – so the best way to prepare for the interview is to review your resume and essays and practice articulating your past experiences and future goals.</p>
<p><strong>Tip #2 – Essays<br></strong>For those of you who are still working on your application, we look forward to receiving it by our Round 2 deadline of January 10th. Please remember that you will need to submit all your materials by that date. </p>
<p>As you work on your application, we suggest that you pay particularly close attention to your essays. Essays are the one area in which you will have the chance to make your application stand out from the rest. They are also the one area in the application where you can communicate directly with the admissions committee about yourself – your background, interests, and career objectives. Because we only have two required essays, we expect that what you write will be clear and focused.</p>
<p><strong>Tip #3 – Get to Know Us</strong> <br>For those of you who are still thinking about whether to apply to Yale SOM, we encourage you to learn more about the program by: </p>
<ul>
<li>reading the latest news on the new core curriculum</li>
<li>getting in touch with one of our Admissions Ambassadors</li>
<li>chatting with other prospective applicants and current students on our Discussion Board</li>
<li>visiting campus and sitting in on a class</li></ul>
<p>Have a safe and happy holiday season! </p>
<p>Best regards, </p>

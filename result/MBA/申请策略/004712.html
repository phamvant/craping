<h1 class="aTitle">Inside Wharton MBA Admissions: Top 10 Applicant Myths We Encounter</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><ul type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">It is better to apply in Round 1 than 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The chances of admission are comparable in both rounds. Round 3 is more selective and allows less time for international students to process visas. <br></font>
</li><li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Wharton is a finance school. <br>Wharton is widely recognized for its breadth and depth of curriculum across 18 disciplines, each of which is taught by world renowned faculty. <br></font>
</li><li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Wharton looks for a set profile of candidate. <br>Wharton seeks a diversity of academic, professional, geographic, and personal backgrounds. We accept many students who have neither studied business nor worked in consulting or investment banking. <br></font>
</li><li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">There are minimums or cut-off scores for the GPA and GMAT. <br>Both measures are evaluated jointly, along with measures of ability to handle quantitative coursework. The distribution of GPA and GMAT scores among admitted students is broad. <br></font>
</li><li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Work experience is a pre-requisite for admission.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Candidates are evaluated on both demonstrated and potential leadership and management skills. Wharton actively encourages individuals to apply when they feel they are ready. For some, this will be directly from undergrad or with only 2-3 years of work experience.<br></font>
</li><li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Candidates are assessed on their number and/or type of extra-curricular activities and community service. <br>We seek well-balanced students who possess a broad perspective on life. Candidates may have less formal commitments that exhibit this balance. Quality is always valued more than quantity. </font><br>
</li><li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Applications are pre-screened. <br>All applications are read in their entirety by at least several members of the Admissions Committee. Admissions decisions are made across multiple criteria; it is the rare candidate who is denied based on one area of an application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> <br>
</li><li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Applicants are evaluated relative to others with the same professional or geographic background. <br>Applicants are evaluated relative to the entire pool. There are simply too many ways to disaggregate and assess candidate profiles. <br></font>
</li><li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I have a better chance of being admitted if I visit or interview on-campus. <br>We are committed to fairness and equity and recognize that there are applicants who are unable to visit us for monetary and/or personal reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></font>
</li><li class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">International students are not eligible for loans or scholarships. <br>International students are guaranteed loans for up to the student budget (tuition and living expenses) through Citibank. Other loans may be obtained and may require a cosigner. All students are eligible to apply and be considered for a fellowship. </font></li></ul>

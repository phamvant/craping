<h1 class="aTitle">MBA with no Working Experience</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>I went to U.S. undergrad and currently working at Citigroup Corporate &amp; Investment Bank in New York. I&nbsp; noticed many students here on the forum are talking about getting a MBA degree right out of college without working full-time for 2 or 3 years, and I feel obligated to share some insight with and give out some advices to you. I feel very<br>strong that getting a MBA without working for 2 or 3 years is not only a waste of money but your own time. </p>
<p>The reasons are: </p>
<p>1) Your chance of getting into top MBA program is slim, if not zero. It is true that many top MBA programs claim that they do accept applications from college seniors, and some of them even waive your application fee. However, as far as I know, you need to have extraordinary academic record, superior leadership experience either in or outside school, and in most cases, an extremely well-thought business idea or a big-name family business awaiting you to take charge. If you don't have all of the above criteria, you should seriously reconsider your plan. Even if you don't care about wasting application fee, a rejected record with your dream school is not very desirable at least. </p>
<p>2) If you are thinking out getting a MBA right now, you probably don't process the maturity factor that most top MBA programs are looking for in any one applicant. From<br>their perspective, how much you are getting paid by your employer is not as important as how well you have survived your first job after college. And this can demonstrate how mature you are and what kind of a person you are in front of your boss and colleagues, as reflected by your recommendations. </p>
<p>3) Working full-time for at least couple years will open your eyes and help you better decide which career path you really want to take. Sometimes a perfect job is not as perfect as you once thought and vice versa. Plus, you can really relate your real-life experience to MBA studies and achieve a better understanding of the work, people, and society. This is very very important for your personal develop and most important for your career promotion along the way. A MBA from Harvard will open as many doors as you can imagine, but after that it's you who decide who you want to be and how you are going to get there. </p>
<p>4) This is a general advice rather than specific. If you don't go to top 10 MBA, please don't go. Getting a MBA for the sake of getting it is very dangerous. We are talking about branding yourself for life. Don't rush and apply only when you are ready. </p>
<p>5) I think Chinese over emphasize the power of education. Education can change life but it's not the only way. A strong work ethic and persistence are more important, in my opinion. These are my two cents . Thanks for taking the time to read and I welcome any comment or correction.</p>

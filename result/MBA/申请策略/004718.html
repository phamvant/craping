<h1 class="aTitle">Too young or too old for MBA</h1>

<p>As far as the adcomms are concerned, it's not age that's the factor, it's experience level (except for a handful of age-biased schools like Harvard).&nbsp; If you've got 14 years of business experience, you're going to have a hard time convincing them that the regular MBA is right for you.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the adcomms' eyes, you'll overshadow your classmates, won't get much out of the program, and you'll be too advanced for the positions available through on campus recruiting.&nbsp; When writing your why MBA essays, these are the issues you'll need to keep in the back of your mind.</p>
<p>Now, if you've only been in the business world for 5+/- years because you were in the military, switched careers, were a late bloomer, whatever (or maybe you're an engineer or tech type), you'll have a much easier time convincing them that the MBA is right for you.&nbsp; Nonetheless, you have to focus on writing a kick ass Why MBA essay.<br>As for recruiting, it depends on your goals and past experience.&nbsp; If you want to be a consultant or i-banker when you grow up, you're going to have a tough hill to climb.&nbsp; Other areas, it will depend.&nbsp; But, you may have to pound the pavement a bit more than your classmates.&nbsp; But in this day and age, no one should rely on on-campus recruiting no matter what their age or experience.</p>
<p>If you've had 8+ years of heavy duty business experience, you might want to consider the EMBA.&nbsp; The pros - you can work while going to school and your classmates are more experienced and more knowledge to share (not to mention better networking).&nbsp; The cons - outrageously expensive if you are self-sponsored, little or no access to career services and on campus recruiting, no summer break to try out internships, little free time for the finer things in life.</p>
<p>To put my comments in perspective, I applied last year at 30 with 9 years of experience.&nbsp; Got dinged across the board.&nbsp; Feedback was I was too experienced for their regular MBA programs.&nbsp; Got into a couple EMBA programs but decided the adcomms were right ;-) and I didn't need it.</p>
<p>I think bschools see value in what a more experienced student can bring to the class discussion, but you still have to make the case for how the degree will propel your career (adcomms need to see you as employable when all is said and done) and why the FT program is the best fit for you.</p>

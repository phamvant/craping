<h1 class="aTitle">加拿大MBA Video Essay 和interview 经验总结</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>背景：</p>
<p>目前已经申了Ivey/ Queen’s Smith/ DeGroote的MBA，其中</p>
<p>DeGroote申的是16年Coop，给的是traditional MBA的offer，已拒。
Ivey和Smith申的是17年年初的mba，刚刚提交video essay. Smith 说要等我的学校成绩单和学历学位证书寄到办公室才能安排面试。目前还没寄，汗。
Ivey预计今天晚上，最晚明天提交申请。</p>
<p>因为是二胎妈妈，还在上班，二宝目前4个月，想了想，觉得16年fall入学太赶，可能影响二宝的哺乳。所以暂定名年年初的mba申请，届时二宝一岁多，可以断奶，我念书也少些牵挂。</p>
<p>对于加国的mba，我只钟情以上申请的三所，因为本人并无金融背景，以后也没打算在投行等金融行业发展，申请加国mba的目的十分明确，个人发展希望继续从事咨询行业，顺带实现带全家移民的夙愿。所以Ivey是首选，Smith做备选。</p>
<p>现在发帖，只是想总结下video essay的一点个人感想。</p>
<p>据说video essay是16年新设立的一道槛，旨在提高初轮interview的效率。我个人觉得，按照你学校的期待程度由低到高，video essay由前往后的去录。举个例子，Mc Master DeGroote的coop MBA虽然是性价比最高的，也传说是加拿大最好的mba项目，不过因为16年fall开学，我申请时已经是尾巴的末端了，所以确实不报希望；同时考虑到小宝，就把它设立成期待值最低的申请，先录的是也是它。Ivey应该是最适合我也是录取最难的，我就最后录Ivey的video。具体原因见第二点</p>
<p>Kira Interview 是这些学校录video interview的平台。虽然我是第一次用Kira，不过我本人就是做类似系统咨询的，相对比较了解系统及数据库的逻辑。经过本人验证，准备了一份question list,同学们如果按照这个去准备自己的面试题，差不多能40% 的碰到原题（不敢绝对保证，而且估计对今年申17年的才有帮助），欢迎大家一起来验证，一起添加题目（一些生活相关的，比如talk about your favorite movie等题我就没添加了，那些考过雅思的同学应该都不陌生）。这种系统，又是第一年投入使用，题库肯定是非常有限的。</p>
<p>我比较懒，准备的questionlist还包括部分之前看前辈们的面经积累的题目。所以也许对二轮interview也有帮助也说不定。</p>

Q: What towrite and what not to write in essays?</p><p>A: Other thanstudying for the GMAT or GRE, the essays are typically the most time consumingpart of an application.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;I know when I read a good essay because it answers the question and isspecific about the applicants goals, experiences, etc. A good essay is personal enough to tell a storywithout going too far. <br>&nbsp;<br>The worst thing tosee in an essay is another school's name. Double, triple check those essays!Also spell check and have someone else read you essays before turning them in.</p><p>一篇好的essay 应该是一个包含申请人职业发展的故事。最糟糕的事情就是你的essay 上面有别的学校的名字，反复检查，不要犯这种低级错误啊！</p><p>2. Q: When it comes to recommendation letters, what are the biggest faux pas you have seen? Also, do youprefer receiving recommendations strictly from a workplace perspective, or doyou actually prefer getting a different perspective of the candidate from oneof the recommendation letters (such as community service, extracurriculars,etc.)?</p><p>A: I would say the biggest mistakeis having someone write a letter who does not know you, but you think becauseof their title that it will carry more weight. I would say find someone whoknows you and knows what you have done and can detail why you would be a goodfit. </p><p>The only time this might not be the case would be if the recommender wasan alumni and knows the school and program. This person could then detail whyyou would be a good applicant because they know you and the program. </p><p>We preferprofessional references but we will take academic. Recommendations fromcommunity service activities are fine, as well.</p><p>糟糕的推荐信是找一个名声很大但是不了解你的人来推荐你， Carey 建议找一个了解你的人写推荐信。</p><p>Wed Sep 19, 201212:41 pm</p><p>3. Q: Can youdescribe what exactly do you look in a candidate for the selection?&nbsp; And what is the weight age of the recommender's letter?</p><p>A: We honestly consider the entireapplication. Obviously the numbers, GMAT/GRE and GPA are important, butjust as important is fit with the program. We spend a lot of time reading overessays to determine how a prospective student might fit in with our culture andmission. For information on our admissions criteria, it can be found </p><p>I think your question is in regards to how much weight do therecommendation letters carry. Please let me know if this is correct. The recommendation letters arevery important, but I would say less important than the essays.</p><p>考虑申请人整体的符合程度，当然面试官还是说了推荐信没有你的essay 重要。所以大家好好对待essay!</p><p>4. QWhat areyour Dos and Don'ts formore personal essays that ask the applicant to "describeoneself" to the panel/admissions committee?</p><p>A：Great question. I would say stick thehighlights, academicexperiences, professional experiences, volunteer and leadership experiences andthen how you came to understand that you wanted an MBA from that school. </p><p>With that said,if there is something that you think is out of the box and in line with whatthe school's mission is, feel free to detail that. For example at Carey we havea hands on international experience called Innovation for Humanity, if an applicant was part of thePeace Corps or had some exceptional international experience and wanted to go into more detail about that, that would make sense in an essay.</p><p>好的个人陈述包含学术经历，工作经历，志愿者经验，领导经验以及如何意识到需要在这个时候读一个MBA. 还有就是，国际经验这个对于国际生来说无疑很有优势。</p><p>5. Q: Are there any tips you have for those who are applying for B-School for the first time comingfrom a non-business background (I'm a pharmacist by profession).</p><p>A: Goodquestion, Mayank. I would say the most important thing for someone looking atan MBA without a business background is to make sure you do your research onthe programs you are interested in. Review their website, talk to current students or alumni, and again,attend events.&nbsp;</p><p>Then take that information and be able to detail specifically how you,with a different background, would be able to fit into their school andculture. I spend quite a bit of time reading essays and when I see an essaythat is specific and shows that the applicant has made the connection betweenthemself and our school, it's definitely a good thing.</p><p>Wed Sep 19, 201212:15 pm</p><p>6: Q:How does Carey view career changers?I've seen some schools look for students who have a very specific career pathin mind, and other schools who are more concerned with what you've done knowingthat the MBA experience will expose you to new things and influence your careerdirection.</p><p>A: Greatquestion and we love career changers! You are correct, people choose to go to Business School for a number of reasons and a lot of time it's because they are looking for a different professional path. We see this a lot and just ask that an applicant detail how their past experiences have prepared them for the MBA, and what they hopeto get out of the MBA experience.</p><p>如果你申请MBA 但是有很重大的career changes. 只要你能说明你过去的经验能怎么帮助你顺利完成MBA并且找到你心中理想的工作就可以了。 </p><p>--------------------------------------</p><p>原文引自：<br><a href="https://forum.chasedream.com/thread-837333-1-1.html">https://forum.chasedream.com/thread-837333-1-1.html</a></p><p>参与讨论及查看更多的相关文章请访问【北美MBA申请区】<br><a href="https://forum.chasedream.com/forum-13-1.html">https://forum.chasedream.com/forum-13-1.html</a></p></div>

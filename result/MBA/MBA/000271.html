<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>Sorry, can't input chinese.</p><ol><li>Why MBA?</li><li>Why Ross?</li><li>Followed up with why Erb and Tauber? Answered briefly (It was my question for her)</li><li>If graduated from Ross, what kinda alumni do you wanna be?</li><li>Tell me a time when you convinced/encouraged a group of people? And following up questions.</li><li>If no science, engineering, or business, what would you do?</li><li>Questions for her. </li></ol><p>I felt like I did not do well, especially questions 4 and 6. Her questions were not that straightforward. I wrote a thank you letter afterwards, but she did not respond. Is that normal??</p><p>And some drama happened during the interview.</p><ol><li>The interview was in a cafe. I arrived 15 minutes earlier and waited for 10 minutes to find a seat.</li><li>The interviewer was late for about 5 minutes (I called her at our scheduled time, just in case).</li><li>No resume-walk. The lady was pretty down-to-earth. For example, business school is nothing but to help you find a job. Thus, I did not say a lot of crap.</li><li>I could not find my wallet to pay my coffee afterwards. She paid it for me. (it was damn cold that day. I changed clothes in my car before walking to the cafe. My wallet was in my car).</li><li>I arrived around the cafe early and reviewed the questions in my car (with heat and fan). The battery of my car ran out. Jesus. (I did not realize this until long after).</li><li>Returned from the interview, my car couldnot ignite on a bridge (it was snow outside, so damn cold).</li><li>My car was on a police car spot. Almost got ticketed by cops.</li><li>Asked a lot of people in cold and finally started my car.<br></li></ol><p>--------------------------------------</p><p>原文引自：<br><a href="https://forum.chasedream.com/North_American_MBA/thread-803447-1-1.html">https://forum.chasedream.com/North_American_MBA/thread-803447-1-1.html</a></p><p>参与讨论及查看更多的相关文章请访问【北美MBA申请区】<br><a href="https://forum.chasedream.com/North_American_MBA/list-1.html">https://forum.chasedream.com/North_American_MBA/list-1.html</a></p></div>

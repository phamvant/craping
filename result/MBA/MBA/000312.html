<h1 class="aTitle">收到UT Austin (McCombs) MBA 拒信，报申请经验，求攒人品 [2013-02-15]</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>受到UT的拒信。硬指标都是一样的（G740, T105；6年corporate, 3年海外，油田服务行业；国内重点大学本硕，GPATop2），软指标方面： 
面试面得很好（校面试官当场反馈），但是整个application质量较粗糙，essay写的很烂，简历写得很低调（第一版，没有修改就交了，惭愧！），再加上刚到美国生活没有工作，可能都是短板。供大家参考。欢迎拍砖。</p><p>我对UT印象不错，感觉在校生，admission和校友都很nice，无缘得进，可惜了。</p><p>祝大家都拿到心仪的offer！</p><p>最后附我当时收集的面试题目，面了1.5hours，除了少数临场发挥，问题基本全中。</p><ul><li>

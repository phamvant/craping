我申请的R1,10月15日压线交的申请，我问过学校，她说他们在申请截止后才开始审阅材料，所以同一轮里第一天提交申请还是最后一天没有区别。大概11月初同时收到了videointerview和face-to-face interview邀请。</p><p>关于video interview题目我总结过，见以下链接<a href="https://forum.chasedream.com/thread-1227006-1-1.html">https://forum.chasedream.com/thread-1227006-1-1.html</a><br>&nbsp;<br>face-to-faceinterview可以skype, on campus，或者选择他们去你的城市做宣传的时候面试。我选的是去校园面试。</p><p>强烈建议方便的同学面试前参加项目的SHADOW DAY， 和CURRENT STUDENTS一起交流以下，感受一下课堂氛围。面试时候也有更多POINTS可以说，了解了这个项目的话回答WHY FOSTER就不会太空洞。shadow day, information session等举办的日期都可以在项目网站上看到。</p><p>ANYWAY，项目学生平均工作经验在六年左右，所以感觉学校比较偏爱招工作经验多一些的，比较好拿奖学金。我个人认为5Y+工作经验比较理想。我自己目前只有两年full time, 所以不是很有信心被录取，不过还是拿到OFFER了，是小奖，第一年一共USD15k，offset一部分学费，第二年奖学金得再申请，basedon 第一年的表现。在论坛看到牛人奖学金offset学费等最后只需要叫2万美元就读完项目了，这应该是大奖吧，哈哈。</p><p>问题总结如下，有前辈被问到的还有我被问到的，都包含在以下题目里。祝之后的同学申请顺利！！！</p><p>1.What'sthe strongest point in your application?

<p>面经：</p>
<p>Got in the lobby 15 minutes early and Marcy came out to get me 5 minutes after (so important to arrive early as they stated in the invitation). Started off with small talk and then tell me about yourself.</p>
<p>Took advantage of this intro question to go into career goal and why Wharton. Followed with three standard behavioral questions (involved in a negotiation/worked with someone senior/managed a team that failed). </p>
<p>Left 10 minutes or so for Q&amp;A which I used to highlight my knowledge of latest development at the school (heard from current students). Marcy was very professional and nice so the interview was quite smooth. I tried to take control of our conversation which worked out well. </p>
<p>Lasted ~30 minutes. In short, Wharton interview is quite straightfoward and all about preparing for the pre-defined set of behavioral questions and career goal/Why Wharton.</p>

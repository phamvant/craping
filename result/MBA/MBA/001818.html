<h1 class="aTitle">Cornell MBA Interview R1 [2018.11.28]</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;">
<p>Interviewed on campus with a very nice second-year MBA student (45 mins).</p>
<ol>
  <li>Please introduct yourself.</li>
  <li>How did you balance your work and personal life?</li>
  <li>Describe a hard situation you had with your manager or employee.</li>
  <li>What's your short/long term goal?</li>
  <li>Why consultant?</li>
  <li>Why Cornell and Johnson?</li>
  <li>Did you talk with any Cornell student or alumni? What did you learn?</li>
  <li>What do you like about Ithaca?</li>
  <li>Any question for me?</li>
</ol>
<p>The interview is more conversational. He even refered other MBA students to me after the interview, but I am not sure if it's a good sign. Good luck to you all.&nbsp; </p>

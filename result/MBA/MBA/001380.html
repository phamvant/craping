  <li>Core recruiters' concentration for admission;</li>

</ul>
<p><strong><em>ChaseDream:  Hi, Jason, could you please give a brief introduction of Hult to our netizens?</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Jason: </strong>We're a global business school. At Hult, we  provide programs for undergraduates and graduate programs, which include MBA,  Masters, EMBA, as well as executive education. So, at all levels of the business  world, we provide education. We pride ourselves on the highly global school with  total 7 campuses around the globe. We pride ourselves on the very relevant and  practical education for business, bringing students in and sending them out. We  do also pride ourselves on really focusing on the way the business world is changed  and rapid changing business world requires business people who are able to adapt  quickly and be very innovative. That's why we strive to look for our students  and we strive to prove our students upon why they're here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>ChaseDream:  What sets Hult's MBA program apart from the rest? In other words, could you  please tell me the unique points of your MBA program comparing with peer  schools? </em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Jason: </strong>Sure, I think, the key starts with how we developed the MBA Program. It's based on  going out to CEOs and finding out what kind of talent they needed in their  company. And we crafted our programs very much around, making sure that  everyone they leave Hult has gone through and acquired all those skills, for  hard skills and soft skills, that can make them effective in the business  world. So I think that's core we designed our programs. And the other core  piece is around the global rotation. We think we are quite unique. We have the  7 campuses, which are our own campuses. And we very much encourage and promote  the fact that you can actually study in up to three of these campuses during  your time in the MBA. I think those two things combined we created the most  relevant and global experience for our students. We believe that every business  person today needs to be thinking globally and to be thinking about the way  that they can be thrived in the business world, constantly changing, constantly  to be able to adapt. And I think that's really core to what sets us apart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>ChaseDream:  What do you think is the greatest difference among global campus rotation  locations?</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Jason: </strong>Each campus has its own unique purpose. Be  honest, 30 people want to go to 30 campuses and they want to live in 30 cities,  that's one thing. But we've chosen strategically the location for our campuses  to really give students the best opportunity to study in the right place for what  they are interested in. So for our San Francisco campus, there is no better  city to go to for learning about technology and innovation. London campus, it's  part of the city, very close to the financial community of London. Boston is  really a central education and business minds with a lot of high academics just  in and around that area. And then, the Shanghai campus, we think our students  should have exposure.to the world. The world changing economy is China, what  better city to have it than in dynamic Shanghai? The other campus that I  mentioned, Ashridge campus, about an hour outside of London, which is very much  focused on leadership, that's primarily for our executive education. And New  York is another campus we have, which is focused on media and financial.</p>
  <p>And our diverse campus again is, one for  experience in different culture, in a different way of working. So for us, we  think they are very different experiences from what you get culture was. The  commonality is related to what courses were teaching and we made it very easy for  you to switch. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>ChaseDream:  How many Chinese applicants had been accepted in recent 2-3 years? </em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Jason: </strong>It is probably a little bit difficult for me to  go back. What I can say is that we have about 150 students from China this year  across all of our Master programs, including MBA program. And that's been  growing to some degree of last few years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>ChaseDream: For both Master and MBA, what about alumni in China? How many totally?</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Jason: </strong>We have about 650 alumni currently in China. We find  that alumni are very dedicated to Hult. Our students can lever the alumni to  find jobs. That's one of the key ways for students to find jobs, whereas there is  alumni getting to their companies to come onto the campus to recruit or  directly been contacted by the students.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>ChaseDream:  Among your admission requirements, which one do you think matters most? What is core recruiters' concentration?</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Jason: </strong>One of the key things is that we make sure we  interview with each one of the perspective students. We try to find the right  kind of person, the right kind of fit. So we very much focus on our interview questions  in finding out how much global citizen they are or can be, how much they  embrace various cultures, the thought of working across boards, and making sure  they are fast thinkers and be able to adopt change, be able to challenge and be  innovative. That's what for us makes the richest and most differentiative  student body. That clearly the test scores, grades and working experience are  also our important minimum standards, but what we are trying to get to is  really making sure we have the right fit of the student body. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>ChaseDream:  For MBA applicants, are work experiences important to their application? Does  job title matter?</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Jason: </strong>Yes, absolutely. For the MBA, a minimum  requirement of working experience and what they did with that experience is a  very important factor. For us, it's not the job title, but what the person has  done in the job. So, it's not so much around the title, but we want to make sure  that they have had a fairly robust set of work experiences. For people who  worked in startups, they are quite valuable students for us to have in the  class, providing innovation and entrepreneurship of the student body. They do  not need a job title if they push the business on their own. We think that is a  rich experience that can benefit the rest of the class. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>ChaseDream: </em></strong><em><strong>I note that your MBA program is one year. How should students handle  both the core curriculum study and the 6 weeks' module work in companies in the  one year time?</strong></em><strong></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Jason:</strong><strong></strong>There is no easy answer. It's a very intensive  program and it's a lot of hard work. I think from our perspective, that's one of  the things again during interview process that we want to make sure that people  are aware of the level of work they are going to have to commit to in this  program. Our students do get through the academics and do the internship, do  the modules as some of their credit, but it takes their initiatives to make  sure they can work well with our career services and find that right  internship, and at the same time, being applying for jobs for after the graduates.  So, there are a lot of things to do and it is quite hard work. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>ChaseDream:</em></strong> <em><strong>By the way, how does Hult help  some students to make career switch?</strong></em><strong></strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Jason: </strong>Our career service starts even before people  have arrived on campus. Because it's a one year program, we try to engage  students very early, so that they are not behind as they are trying to find  jobs. They each have as many personal consultations with the career service  advisor to help them prioritize if they try to change both industry, as well as  job function, to make a big switch. We have several rotation campuses to help  make a switch. But I think it's about getting them started early; it's about  having these personal consultations; it's about crafting the courses they take to  help them to bridge the gap, perhaps with the job function and industries they  are trying to go to. And there is also the internship, which can be a step tool  if you are trying to make a big leap in both job function, as well as industry.    </p>
    <p>We try to have a path for everybody; we try to  work them through; we also try to get people ready early and ask them to think about  and work as hard as they can on making the switch.</p>
  </blockquote>
<p><strong><em>ChaseDream:  Many B-schools are further expanding their  advantages like connecting with industries, so what's the most exciting  development at Hult in recent years?</em></strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Jason:</strong> I  think one of the most exciting developments in the last couple of years is really  the insertion of leadership development as part of the curriculum. We think the  soft skill will carry you though out your entire career, even if particular  technologies or practices change. </p>
    <p>At the same time, the  year-to-year built alumni network and network with corporations that help us to  get more and more interested companies on campus to get the informed students.  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>ChaseDream:  During recruitment season, what types of corporations would like to come?</em></strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Jason: </strong>We  have all sorts of corporations to come. Our largest employer is<strong></strong>Google, in terms of where people got  job. But we have people got jobs of consultancies, like Deloitte, PWC, and jobs  at banking institutions all over the world, as well as jobs at lots of startups.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>ChaseDream:</em></strong> <em><strong>As far as I know, school's ranking is what  most Chinese applicants concerned about, especially on US News and Financial  Times. However, our netizens found that on Financial Times, there's no ranking  for Hult in recent two years. Will you engage in it in the future? But on economist, 2016 Global Full time MBA ranking,  Hult ranked 60 in the world.</strong></em><strong></strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Jason: </strong>Yes, we're on the track that we'll reappear on  those rankings in 2018. We have also recently gained four spots in the  Bloomberg Businessweek, ranking us #17 Best International MBA of 2016.</p>
</blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>ChaseDream: Very nice to hear that. Are there any aspects of  program that you'd like to highlight? Or What suggestions would you like to  offer to global oriented Chinese applicants?</em></strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Jason: </strong>I think we've covered the key aspects. My  general advice is that applicants should look at what is best fit for what they  want to do and what they want to be as a business person when they are looking  into business schools. We think we stand very strongly for someone who wants to  think globally, work globally, wants to be in the fast-paced business world. We  think we stand very well for focusing on those kinds of leadership. We want to  make the impact in the world when they are doing in business. While there are lots  of great business schools out there, we want students to look very much at what  is the rank fit for them and the kind of business person they want to be. And  we think, for particular types of business person, we fit very well for those  criteria. </p>

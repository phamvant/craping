<h1 class="aTitle">IE MBA interview面经 [2012-04-19]</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>I took IE admission test and then IE admission interview today in the morning, without breakfast and the process took more than 3 hours.</p>
<p>Admission test and personality questionaire were both hard and fun.</p>
<p>Interview by Albert:</p>
<p>Q1, Why IE.<br>Q2, Short term and long term career goal.<br>Q3, You managed a lot of people. ( I functionally led 500 people in sales )<br>Q4, You must travel a lot ( International working experience ).<br>Q5, Based on your seniority ( 10-year WE, GM with International subordinates ), do you consider EMBA program, because Admissions may highly recommend EMBA to you. EMBA &amp; MBA are the same in term of curriculum, faculty, degree, but are different in classmates, and EMBA is a part time program, more economic. ( No, I need to refresh my life and I need dedicated studying experience, IMBA is my choice, and a new friend is 2012 IMBA intake )</p>
<p>May receive feedback in two weeks or so. Cheers !</p>

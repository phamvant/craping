<h1 class="aTitle">[已录] 加拿大 Brock University MBA Kira 面经 [2019.02.16]</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>楼主 2.3 完成申请，2.9 收到面试，很拖拉今天晚上才录……一共八个问题，最后一个是written question，前面七个都是口语问题。比较紧张已经有点懵了所以有的问题可能忘记了。</p>
<ol>
  <li>What do you think are the best and most challenging aspects of coming to study in Brock next year? Why do you choose Canada?</li>
  <li>What's your weakest area in English language? What strategy are you currently using to improve your English language proficiency?</li>
  <li>Graduate programs at Goodman require a substantial amount of group work. Tell me about a time when you were working with a group that wasn't functioning well together. What did you do, and what was the outcome?</li>
  <li>How do you think a Master's program can help you with your career goals? Why?</li>
  <li>If you could do your undergraduate studies again, would you do the same things you did? If not, what would you like to change?</li>
  <li>（附带一个因为 Kira 把我卡退了，没存上的问题）<br>
    (1)If a group of students move to another country. They only interact with the student amongst the group. What advices would you give them?<br>
    (2)What do you think is the reason students who travel abroad only form relationships with the people from the same country? Do you think it is negative or positive?</li>
  <li> If you were to create a slogan for your life, what would you choose?</li>
  <li>How can companies attract and retain their best talents?</li>
</ol>
<p>我觉得前四个问题是比较保守的 why school，career goals，英语等问题，非常好准备，后面4个就是那种创新题，参照之前两个楼主的面经问题我觉得起码就这个学校面经帖出现的低频率应该是不太可能遇到同样问题。建议大家随机应变，把我们的面经问题（只要不是太飞的）都准备准备，到时候有的答案可以套来套去。</p>
<p>因为楼主申的是 MBA 所以问题没有涉及很专业的，但我在别的帖子看到好像是申 accounting 还是 Finance 的同学就会被问到比较专业的知识惹……</p>
<p>更新一下，2.28号录取了。</p>

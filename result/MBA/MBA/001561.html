<h1 class="aTitle">Queen's MBA interview experience</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>Hi guys - as a tradition to give back to the community, I'd like to share my experience and thoughts on the MBA interview with Queen's. Hope this could be of some help to those applying or are interested in MBA programs in Canada in general.</p>
<p>Out of all four I interviewed with - the other three being Rotman, Ivey, Schulich, Queen's has the best and most professional interview team, showcasing how much weight they put into each application that's invited for an interview. My interviewers are director of the MBA program and director of career services. Both are extremely experienced in their respective area of expertise but easy to talk to.</p>
<p>The interview itself lasted for 30min - starting with walk-thru of resume, and then follow-up questions by the interviewers based on your resume and some key points they've picked up in the application profile, and in the end 1-2 questions (they stressed asking something that can't be found on their website/oneline). Very tightly packed and efficient.</p>
<p>In terms of questions - the interviers didn't ask any boiler-plate questions out of no context, but tied their enquiries very closely with what I said in my resume walk-thru, hence making the entire conversation cohesive and interactive. One suggestion to all prospective interviewees is that, really know your stories cold, and be able to articulate what your experience/examples reflect you from the perspectives of personality, career objectives, etc.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, decisions will be made within 2 weeks of the interview date.</p>
<p>Good luck, and let me know any questions.</p>

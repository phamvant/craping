<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>Recieved Haas' sponsor $40K and meanwhile the admission from Kellogg. Very lucky.</p>
<p>Copy my background hereof: PKU Law 88/100, Eco 84/100, PRC lawyer 3.5 years, G:730 T:104</p>
<p>Thanks to my interviewer, a very nice alum!</p>
<p>My interview questions: </p>
<ol>
<li>Why MBA? (I also said my career goals.)</li>
<li>Why now?</li>
<li>Two leadership stories (one in university, another in professional)</li>
<li>Conflict story</li>
<li>Why Kellogg?</li>
<li>My hobbies (why art? Why law? Why running?)</li>
<li>Any questions regarding Kellogg or interviewer?</li></ol>
<p>Collectively lasted over 70 min.&nbsp; A quite relaxed talk.&nbsp; It was my first interview, so I didn't prepare a lot.&nbsp; As my interviewer said: speak from your heart and you will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Good luck to all!</p>

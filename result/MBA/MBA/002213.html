<h1 class="aTitle">2021 加拿大申请总结 [2020.10.10]</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>跟伙伴们分享一下加拿大主要学校项目的 MBA 面试的题目和题库以及自己准备面试和拿到 offer 的一些心得。</p>
<p>面试的题目分成以下几类，我也想分享一下自己的理解的准备心得。</p>
<p>第一大类：PERSONALITY &amp; “FIT” QUESTIONS</p>
<p><strong>Personal Characteristics</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Tell me about yourself.</li>
<li>Give me the five-minute “tell me everything I should know about you” presentation.</li>
<li>What are you passionate about, and why?</li>
<li>How do you prioritize?</li>
<li>What does global competition mean to you?</li>
</ol>
<p>这一类题目主要是从直观了解你，你的表达，你的言谈举止，性格，等等，这里要注意两个方面：<br>
1）面试官到底问的是什么问题：比如多大 MBA 招生官 Agnes 就问的我：Tell me about your self and your journey after college. 所以这里要从大学之后开始讲。那这一类自我介绍题目重点有以下几个：</p>
<ol>
<li>整体思路框架：应该是你的 1-3 段工作经历（或者更多），在每个工作经历重的职位，自己负责的主要内容，和工作成就，同时也要突出自己在每个经历的 learning and growth.</li>
<li>自我介绍开始就是展示自己的 personal branding 了，所以从开始就要按照之前 mock interview 和自我准备的 plan 去展示了（这里还有很多内容，可能我要再写一篇关于如何做 personal branding 的内容了），简而言之，就是抓住自己的 core values in presentation（for instance - mine is outgoing + open to learn + career foucsed)那在讲述自己的 story 的时候就要按照这些特色来合理展开，突出重点，很好的展示自己的 first impression（当然如果之前就有对接过面试官的话，那就另当别论了）</li>
<li>比如：我在 P&amp;G 做 Product Marketing Manager, I was responsible for account A, B, C; I led my team in consumer analysis in regard to D. We achieved 20% growth in E. I Learned that...is the key to..., etc. 大题是这个模版啦，加上一些 transition words 应该就会很棒了。</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Strengths &amp; Weaknesses</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What is your greatest weakness?</li>
<li>What is your greatest strength?</li>
<li>Give me three of your strengths and three of your.</li>
</ol>
<p>Weaknesses.</p>
<p>这一类题目最重要的就是清楚的认清自己的优势和劣势了，优势我觉得就不用说了，在劣势方面很重要的就是诚实吧，我了解到很多人会说比如对科技不敏感啊，性子急啊，没耐心啊一类的。如果你真的是这一类的话，那可以展开说。但如果不是的话，也不要硬凑。还是认真想想自己的缺点，但是重要的是，要说出来自己是如何弥补自己的缺点的，这才是最重要的。你一定希望招生官可以看到你在弥补不足，在持续学习啦。所以这里注意这一点就好。</p>
<p>比如：我工作的时候因为项目太多或者 multitasing 导致我会在细节上出错，这样的问题往往会给团队其他成员或者其它部门的同事带来不必要的工作。那针对这个问题，我首先建立了自己的一个 failure resume, 在这个 failure resume 里面加入了 pay attention to details 这个自己的问题，然后针对这个问题我会在之后的工作中注意改正这些细节，比如 typo, Upper/lower case, etc. 最后要讲同事/领导是如何称赞你改正了这些问题，持续进步的。</p>
<p><strong>Academics &amp; Extracurriculars</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Why MBA</li>
<li>Why did you choose Ivey/Rotman/Schulich/Queen’s etc.. MBA?</li>
</ol>
<p>个人觉得这类问题特别重要，其实就是借着这个机会向面试官展示自己为什么要去读 MBA，为什么不继续工作了，为什么要去加拿大，为什么不去美国等等，其实也没有这么多问什么了，不过也有可能会问道其中一些。所以这里我觉得最重要的是突出三点：</p>
<ol>
<li>职业发展瓶颈：说明自己之所以读 MBA 是因为工作上遇到的 bottle neck - 比如升值，confined thinking, limited opportunities 这一类的</li>
<li>个人转型需要：自己想从 marketing 转行 finance，因为……</li>
<li>行业转型需要：自己想从 CPG 赚到 consulting，因为……</li>
<li>和项目的 match：个人职业发展需求和项目的 A，B，C 匹配，比如，Ivey 的面试官 Brenda 最后问我还有什么问题么？我问她相比于 Rotman 的地理位置，Ivey 在 London 的这个劣势对项目就业和资源产生了什么影响呢？Ivey 的 MBA 项目又是如何解决这个问题的呢？（感觉有点反 interview 她的意思），然后 Brenda 说了一堆我觉得也真的没有太多实际内容，然后这个时候我和她说"Especially during this COVID period when people have to find jobs/networking at home, it is actually cost-saving to study at Ivey than at Rotman. Student can't go outside doing social so the advantage of studying at Rotman because of location is eliminated" 大概就是这个意思吧，那其实我问这个问题最主要的原因也是要展现我和 Ivey MBA 项目很匹配的一点特质，那就是 Navigate through uncertainties. Ivey 很强调学生应对不确定性，在不确定性中做决定的能力。所以这也是我想通过一个问问题的机会从另一方面突出自己和项目的 match.</li>
<li>Relocation：希望之后去北美发展，而这个 MBA 的跳板对我很有帮助。（当然这里去加拿大可能会让学校觉得你是为了 immigration 啥的，不过我个人觉得其实也没啥啦，那些招生官心知肚明的）</li>
<li>其他需求：比如 work life balance 啥的，在国内螺丝钉 996，出去追求 life quality,请自己编……</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Recruiting Process</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Why do you think that you are the best candidate?</li>
<li>Where else have you applied?</li>
</ol>
<p>这一类和上面有点像，但是更突出的就是你和项目的匹配度，以及你的其他选择，因为学校面试官也挺好奇你的其他进展的，所以这两方面都要准备一下。</p>
<ol>
<li>和项目匹配度：其实之前说了很多了，要去 research 学校项目的特色，校友 alumni 的一些回馈啊，经历啊什么的发掘出来这个学校的一些特色，然后突出自己和这些特色之间的 match&amp;fitness.</li>
<li>在和 Ivey 面试官 Brenda 面试中，她问了我还申请了其他什么 MBA 项目，并且问我觉得这写项目之间的不同指出是什么？那当然如果你特别了解每个你申请项目的不同，当然，也是一定有不同的。比如 Ivey 最一开始的 MBA 也多 2 年制，后来为了差异竞争，缩短到了一年，然后更加突出了 case 教学等等。</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Successes</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Describe a challenging experience.</li>
<li>What has been your biggest success?</li>
<li>What are your two major accomplishments?  What makes them so special?</li>
<li>Which work experience in the past were you most proud of?</li>
<li>What project are you the proudest of?</li>
</ol>
<p>这一类题目我觉得应该没啥问题，个人成就主要就要说一下自己的职业伤的一些成就吧，创业经历啊，项目成果啊，获奖啊等等。这里还是要突出在做这件事情的过程中是如何一步一步解决问题，运用 tools/processes 去分析问题，并且最后解决问题，drive results 的。</p>
<p><strong>Future</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Where do you see yourself in 1-2 years/5 years/10 years/ a few years?</li>
<li>What are the three things you want to be remembered by?</li>
<li>If you could have one wish for your future after graduation, what would it be?</li>
</ol>
<p>这一类问题也是经常被问到的，面试官会问你的职业规划，短期/长期职业目标等等。这里最重要的就具体，细节，专业(Specific + Detail + Professional)SDP 的意思呢就是要首先清楚的说明自己 MBA 毕业后想从事 A 行业的 B 公司的 C 职位，希望在 3-5 年内得到晋升 D 的机会，那么在 3-5 年工作期间我的目标是希望专注在（比如）运营领域的 operating profit, 希望可以提高公司 8% 的 operation profit 类这一类的。然后在 long term career plan 里面的话就是要宏观的说说自己的人生梦想了，比如我要开一家自己的“火锅店”一类的。</p>
<p>“Off-the-Wall” Questions</p>
<ol>
<li>Who’s your hero?  Who do you admire?</li>
<li>What is your favorite color?  Why?</li>
<li>What kind of animal do you consider yourself most like? Why?</li>
<li>What is the craziest thing that you have ever done?</li>
<li>What was the last book you read for fun?</li>
</ol>
<p>我自己觉得在 KIRA/网上录制面试中会遇到这样“托福”类型的问题，这个真的就是个人发挥了，自己清楚自己要表达什么。那么在准备过程中的话，最重要的是：</p>
<ol>
<li>知道自己答题的 frame work，比如 Rotman 有一道题问:"Imagine you could be any kind of animal, what sort of animal would you like to be and why?" 那其实呢，我在练习的时候还真的准备到了，就回答了我想成为 monkey, because the monkey is smark, social, can climb up trees and fly over trees.</li>
<li>多自己联系，录制视频，然后回看提高改正，各种类型比如 travel, ice cream, hobby, go back in time, take risk 等等一类的。</li>
</ol>
<p>接下来就是最中重要的表现类问题了，那这一类题其实回答模版和思路就更重要了，别用 STAR 的模式(Situation, Task, Action, Result)来回答每一问题。这些问题我在准备过程中是花最多时间和经历的，因为要 look back 想自己的工作经历，不断总结反思提炼，看看有没有可以升华的地方。</p>
<p>第二大类：BEHAVIOURAL QUESTIONS</p>
<p><strong>Leadership</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Tell me about a time when you were in a group and you led it.（自己作为一个leader是如何lead团队，这里lead有很多方面，所以可以想自己在团队中自己擅长的方面，讲出这个process）</li>

<h1 class="aTitle">Kelley MBA Interview Experience in Beijing [2013-02-26]</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>I was interviewed by James Holmen from IU Kelley yesterday morning in Beijing, quite a pleasant experience in general.</p><p>I scheduled my appointment at 9:45 am. Assuming traffic jams splattered all over the city on a monday morning, I left home early. When I arrived, it was only 8:15. </p><p>"It must be a dream", I thought, "How come there a monday morning without the grand parking?" I slapped my face for a reality check. It hurt.</p><p>And there Jim sat, interviewing a girl. I took a cozy sofa spot nearby, and ordered a cup of coffee. The girl finished her interview at 8:50. I stepped up to say hello then retreated to my original spot finishing my coffee and browsing twitter. 9:33, it was my turn.</p><p>Jim started my interview right after the last candidate left. No rest, no coffee, must be a tiring day for him.</p><p>We started off by some casual talks. Beijing weather, Beijing Air pollution, why I arrived so early (I did not tell him about the reality check part...) And then:</p><ol><li>Why MBA <br>(I added the "why Kelley" part in my answer, anyway that's to be asked)</li><li>A lot experience-related questions</li><li>Career goal and why</li><li>What passion/characteristics led to your current success</li><li>How would your team/colleague describe you</li><li>Cross-cultural communication experience</li><li>What do you do out of work</li><li>Question for him and school</li></ol><p>Jim is so nice that talking with him is an absolute pleasure. He took real interest into conversation and made notes from time to time.</p><p>Before I left the hotel I paid for my coffee. "40.25 Yuan, sir." said in a sweet voice by a female hotel staff. </p><p>"40.25? Why is there a .25?"</p><p>"There is an additional service fee included."</p><p>That's when I realized I got used to integer-pricing.</p><p>Out of the hotel gate to my surprise, it was snowing. Snow flakes swirled down in great rushes over Beijing in amazing silence.</p><p>Wish all of you luck and peace. And if there is to be any peace it will come through being, not having.</p><p>--------------------------------------</p><p>原文引自：<br><a href="https://forum.chasedream.com/thread-808240-1-1.html">https://forum.chasedream.com/thread-808240-1-1.html</a></p><p>参与讨论及查看更多的相关文章请访问【北美MBA申请区】<br><a href="https://forum.chasedream.com/forum-13-1.html">https://forum.chasedream.com/forum-13-1.html</a></p></div>

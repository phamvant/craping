<h1 class="aTitle">UT Austin Mccombs MBA R3 interview, better late than never</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>I'm sorry that I post it so late, I thought I had done it.</p>
<p>I'm an applicant in R3, and arranged my interview with an Chinese alumna.</p>
<p>The alumna Aili Zhang is so nice, she is such a friendly and passionate person as other students or alumni I've met.</p>
<p>About my interview, I guess it kinda went well, but I'm a little worried about that half way through our conversation, she began to talk with me in Chinese, I'm not sure it meant it was too hard to understand my English or the opposite.</p>
<p>Below are the topics we talked about:</p>
<ol>
<li>Self-introduce</li>
<li>Why MBA?</li>
<li>My career goal. Then some following questions. (If I'm not mistaken, we began to talk in Chinese from these follow questions, I don't remeber whether there was some other questions she asked between the two topics.)</li>
<li>Compare my current employer and previous employer, two primary difference.</li>
<li>My stengths/attributes.(Loss of memory again... I'm not sure whether it was the last question she asked.)</li></ol>
<p>Then I asked her three questions and several following questions.</p>
<p>That's all. The whole interview lasted about 1hour.</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

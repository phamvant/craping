I don't think the interviewer asked me a lot questions and a lot of them just came up because what I said. The interview was a lot less intense than the HBS one and we did share some laughs together. The interviewer had everything from application in her Ipad and she did check on it from time to time. She did remind me to say the outcome of the events which we all knew is important. For the most part, she let me talk until the cows come home, and she was writing on her note pad all the time except the last 15 minutes. </p><p>1.

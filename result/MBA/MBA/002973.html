<h1 class="aTitle">HBS MBA伦敦 面经 外加一个问题... [2012-02-23]</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>The interviewer was extremely nice which made it hard to tell whether the interview went right or wrong... questions include...</p>
<ol>
<li>tell me about your work. what do you do. what role you play</li>
<li>assuming I am a new Associate, tell me in an elevator speech what I need to do about the project</li>
<li>follow-up questions on the industry I mentioned I was working in</li>
<li>how would the people you coached describe you</li>
<li>what is your career aspiration with follow-up questions</li>
<li>why do you think an MBA is important to achieve your career goal</li>
<li>challenges I faced moving to London with follow-up questions</li>
<li>question based on the CV: asked about the volunteer work I did</li>
<li>question based on the CV: I was saying on my CV that I like to cook, so he asked what would be my signature dish</li>
<li>question based on the CV: also about my hobby</li>
<li>how could you contribute to HBS</li></ol>
<p>总体感觉是话题经常换，每一个topic都聊聊但不是很深入，只要不纠结于为什么总在换话题，总体的flow感觉还是很流畅的。问题非常tailored，没什么跟essay有关的，但是很多based on CV，所以大家一定要多看看自己的CV... I was really surprised that my interviewer actually asked questions about cooking and dancing...<br>Interviewer人实在是太nice了，也总是面带微笑，给人感觉非常好。</p>
<p>希望对大家有所帮助。加油！！！<br>也希望我两所学校都有offer</p>
<p>想请问大侠们，怎么能查到我的interviewer的全名啊？HBS网站有list么？谢谢！！！ </p>

<h1 class="aTitle">In@ Insead Fonty Round 2 with interview experience  [2014-02-21]</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>I received my offer over photo yesterday and I can't wait to share with you guys:</p><p>My background: Undergraduate at HKUST , business major, low GPA, Big 4 in Hong Kong for four years, Gmat 710</p><p>For my application, i was very overwhelmed by the many essay required. And i did not use the optional essay, for which I was told not to write unless you have something very important to say. My focus on my application is my international experience (my exchange in france, secondment in work, and etc) and my willingness to learn and adapt. My future aspiration is to join retail industry in asia, even starting my own brand.</p><p>For the interview, I met with two alumni, one from SCB, another from M&amp;S. I had my first interview in the banker's office. It was a 45 minutes. I sent my CV to him before, so we basically discuss on my CV. There is one aspect interesting about me, my recent experience of working as salesperson in a department store. It was an unusual change from an chartered auditor. So I also took the opportunity to convince him my passion and career goal of working in retail industry. Owing the fact that he has little experience in Retails, he didnt challenge me much and he seems intrigued that he finally met an unconventional candidiate.</p><p>The question he asked other than my CV: what is your future career plan? What other school you applied besides insead? What is your first choice?</p><p>My second interview was with a retail personnel. She was very experienced and very friendly to talk to. It was an 2 hour interview, for which it overran a while. She was also interested in my job as salesperson; i carefully explained to her my commitment in retail industry and what i learned as a salesperson for my future career. We mostly talked about different brands, retail strategy, our point of view of future retail industry. At the end, she also asked me, where do i see myself in 5 years and 10 years? What other MBA school you applied, and what is your first choice?</p><p>Overall, I feel that it might be more difficult for a typical banking candidate to get in than someone with a more interesting background. At least it helped with interview that interviewers would be more interested in you. So please work very hard to think about your future career at the stage of application essay, it will definitely help. </p><p>Besides, I would like to thank all fellows in chasedream.com for their generous help through the process. And for those who also worked in big4, don't be afraid to apply for MBA. We are not disadvantaged in any way.

Tell me about your education and career.<br>2. You said you are pretty good at teamwork, give me an example.<br>3. Give me an example when your initial teamwork trial was not successful, what did you do to improve it?<br>4. Short-term career goal?<br>5. What was the most impactful thing you did during your second job?</p><p>I asked three questions regarding teamwork/competition, Grade Disclosure (K is the only school that discloses students' grades to employers) and advice on how to better leverage the time before MBA maltriculation.</p><p>Seems that they really want someone team-oriented. Good luck to everyone!</p><p>--------------------------------------</p><p>原文引自：<br><a href="https://forum.chasedream.com/thread-1227109-1-1.html">https://forum.chasedream.com/thread-1227109-1-1.html</a></p><p>参与讨论及查看更多的相关文章请访问【北美MBA申请区】<br><a href="https://forum.chasedream.com/forum-13-1.html">https://forum.chasedream.com/forum-13-1.html</a></p></div>

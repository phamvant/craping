<h1 class="aTitle">In @ MIT LGO and HBS MBA + Interview Tips</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p><strong>MIT LGO:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Why MIT? 
</li><li>Why LGO? 
</li><li>Tell me a time when someone on the team did not meet your expectation and how did you go about it? 
</li><li>Tell me one time when you are overwhelmed by a situation and how did you handle it? 
</li><li>My interview was on the short side</li></ol>
<p>about 25 minutes. I was really nervous since it was my first interview. I also asked three questions to the interviewer. Sent the thank you letter before hopping on the plane to Jamaica the next day. Spoke with plenty during the interview fest.&nbsp; Wasn't too sure how I did - I kept on telling people how short my interview was and did not know how to interpret that.</p>
<p><strong>HBS MBA:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Tell me about your work? 
</li><li>What do you do? ( A few follow up questions on products and processes) 
</li><li>Tell me about your team and your office? 
</li><li>What do you suggest you boss continue doing, stop doing and start doing? 
</li><li>Lots of questions on UG experience: Why? 
</li><li>How was it and etc. What is your career vision?</li></ol>
<p>My interview went really well. I was offered to ask questions at the end. I thought that was a positive indicator for sure. I cracked a few jokes ( appropriate ones of course) and felt that I did really well.</p>
<p>I prepared plenty for both interviews. Wrote down answers to possible questions. However, for the MIT one, I spent too much time trying to remember what I wrote down about certain questions during the interview and did not come out too naturally. I also took a day off before the HBS one.</p>
<p>Overall, make sure you know where you want to be and where you came from. Act authentic, professional and show a level of enthusiasm/energy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Best luck to everyone else. I know I am blessed. Tough decision for me especially after joining the MIT open house. I am probably going to pick HBS.</p>

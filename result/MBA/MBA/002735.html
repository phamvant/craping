<h1 class="aTitle">Chicago Booth MBA面试 - 11/29/2011</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>在他公司大厅先等了足足15分钟，校友2000年毕业的，senior director of corporate development in a high-tech firm, a really good-looking guy and very well dressed(I think he could have easily made it to be a pro model)</p>
<p>1) talk about himself a bit<br>2) walk through resume, why did you come to US, why MBA, why Booth?<br>3) how did the acquisition of your previous company work? (he does M&amp;A stuff)<br>4) questions or concerns for him?<br>5) what kind of leaders do you like better?<br>6) what kind of work environment do you like better? collaborative, competitive, independent?<br>7) short-term career goal? long-term?<br>8) what European country do you like the most? 我说Italy, Tuscany countryside，他说他两个月前刚去过一次，blablabla</p>
<p>我以为他是搞general management（最后发现是corporate finance），问了个很傻的问题，他好像对IBD很感兴趣。</p>
<p>面的感觉不好，一共35分钟吧，一开始ice-breaking就做的不好，中途他有好几次都cut me off，感觉明显在赶时间，最不可思议的是他中途居然花了好几分钟在看别的candidate的简历while I was talking，昏死，I'm that boring, sigh ....</p>

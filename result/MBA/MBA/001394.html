<h1 class="aTitle">关于“the act of Congress”这道SC，分享我的个人总结！</h1>

</blockquote><p>考点： <br>
（1）  限制性与非限制性修饰语 <br>
（2）  修饰语的位置 <br>
（3）  Ving的语义 </p><p><strong>（1）绿色的是非限制修饰语（non-essential modifier），黄色的是限制性修饰语（essential modifier）</strong></p><p>关于这点，RON： <br>
(d) is incorrect because it purports to modify"the act of congress" with nonessential modifiers (i.e., modifiersthat are set off by commas). if that's the case -- i.e., if these modifiers areallowed to be nonessential -- then that means "the act of congress"can stand on its own.
that would imply that there has only been one actof congress, ever. <br>
The course offered onWednesdays will fit nicely into your schedule. --&gt; inthis example, "offered on wednesdays" is an essential modifier,signifying that there are also other courses (and so we need the essentialmodifier to narrow the possibilities to one).</p><p></p><p>Offered on Wednesdays, the coursewill fit nicely into your schedule. --&gt;this time we have a nonessential modifier, indicating that "thecourse" can stand on its own. this doesn't make sense unless there is onlyone course. <br>
在各个选项中，只有A受到了限制，E就把定语化为了谓语。但是，句子想表达的IntendedMeaning是——The act of congress ALSO established sth.所以这个做谓语要更合适！</p><p><strong>（2）关于修饰语的位置：</strong> 
<br>D is wrong because,it is a BAD sentencestructure, <br>
Modifier,Modifier,Subject </p><p>Good sentence structure should be <br>
Modifier,Subject ,Modifier <br>
<u>BAD 不一定代表 WRONG。但是读起来非常不GMAT-LIKE！</u></p><p><strong>（3） Ving如果用逗号隔开，主要有两个用法：</strong> <br>
1）做状语，一般在SVO后面，多为伴随修饰V，与V同时发生或作为V的结果。 <br>
2）做定语，一般在SVO前面，修饰S，但S一定要可以发出Ving这个动作。</p><p>



















</p><p>E选项中，如果是ESTABLISHING作为结果伴随就不正确，因为made provision和establish在语义逻辑上是平行的。但如果理解为同时发生呢？</p><p>--------------------------------------</p><p>原文引自：<br><a href="https://forum.chasedream.com/thread-1286090-1-1.html">https://forum.chasedream.com/thread-1286090-1-1.html</a></p><p>参与讨论及查看更多的相关文章请访问【GMAT语法专区】<br><a href="https://forum.chasedream.com/forum-23-1.html">https://forum.chasedream.com/forum-23-1.html</a></p></div>

<p><strong>2013 年官网 suggestion:</strong>
<br>FIRST, an open-ended, introductory question about yourself;
<br>NEXT, a “behavioral” question similar to what you would be asked in a business school or job interview that
asks how you handled a certain professional situation;
<br>FINALLY, a “thought” question that offers a statement and asks if you agree or disagree with it, and why. The
questions are meant to give us a better sense of who you are, how you act, and how you think.</p>

<p>I would especially emphasize that we do not expect perfection with these questions. We know that they are unrehearsed, extemporaneous, in-the-moment responses. We are more concerned about the thoughtfulness of your responses than the “polish” of the presentation. (That said, please do dress appropriately.)</p>

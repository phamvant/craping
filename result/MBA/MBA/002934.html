<h1 class="aTitle">Chicago Booth MBA校友面经 [2012-02-11]</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>一直从CD上获益很多，希望自己的经验对后来人有帮助</p>
<p>上周6在HK面的，校友非常nice，a conversational interview, 有部分问题还是在后来我问问题的过程中和聊天中问的。整个面试大概1个小时。</p>
<p>1. Walk through resume （a few further questions on my career choices）<br>2. ST goal<br>3. Why Booth<br>4. What quality of you are you most proud of<br>5. Tell me an example of you that you turn things back on track when they deviate from normality<br>6. What would your subordinates describe you as a leader<br>7. Your contribution to Booth<br>8. What if you are dinged by Booth, or even all B-schools that you applied<br>9. If you could live your life another time, what changes would you make<br>10. Other B-schools applied</p>
<p>Best luck to the folks waiting for both interviews and final decisions, including myself. </p>

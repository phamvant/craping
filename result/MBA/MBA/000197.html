<h1 class="aTitle">In @ INSEAD (Fonty campus)/ Interview Exp. [2012-12-19]</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>Got the call yesterday. Can't type Chinese on this laptop. </p>
<p>Background: G720; Engineering undergrad (GPA 3.3); 3.5 yr WE in consulting in Canada</p>
<p>Interview experience: Interview with alumni in my local area.</p>
<p>First interview with a recent alum: 1.5 hrs<br>
Asked lots of bahaviour questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tell me a time when you worked with a difficult person.</li>
<li>Tell me a time when you had a disagreement in the team. How did you come to the end solution? (This one relates to the mandatory teams you are placed into during P1/P2 at INSEAD)</li>
<li>Tell me a time when you had to work with people from different cultures/backgrounds.</li>
<li>Tell me a time when you failed to achieve the end goal. What was your takeaway?</li>
</ol>
<p>He also gave me lots of time to ask questions.</p>
<p>Second interview was with an alum that graduated more than 10+ years ago. He is currently the CIO for a chain of bookstores in North America. The entire interview was about 45 minutes.</p>
<ol>
<li>He asked me to walk him through my resume.</li>
<li>Asked why INSEAD, why now?</li>
<li>What would I do if I didn't get in?</li>
<li>Have I ever visited the campus?</li>
</ol>
<p>About 20 minutes into this interview, he said he is done with his questions and opened the floor for me to ask questions. I was very confused at this point on my performance, but decided to ask him some of my prepared questions about his background (since he did engineering as well). </p>
<p>In general, the interviews were very much a conversation. I think they really wanted to know how you would interact with other people in the classroom.</p>
<p>Good luck to those applying in Round 2!!! Hope to see you on campus.</p>

<h1 class="aTitle">Notre Dame Kira 面经 [2019.09.25]</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;">
<p>Just finished my kira. The writing topic is the first time you learn about ND. Speaking questions include disagreement in team setting/skills want to improve/ what you would like to happen at some point of your life?</p>
<p>My internet disconnected one time, so I actually saw four speaking questions. I am so nervous that I can only remember questions I answered. Sorry...But it seems like a brand new one, because I cannot recall a single words.</p>
<p>I found a type in my writing but did not have time to correct it.</p>
<p>Wish me good luck for on campus interview. ND is my dream school.</p>

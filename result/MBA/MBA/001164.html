The interviewer worked in management consulting for two years after Kellogg and switched to entrepreneurship. He just started his own company.</p><p>The interview was very, very conversational and unconventional in a way that my interviewer did not directly throw behavior questions such as "tell me about a time when...". We started the conversation by talking about his start-up and my internship at a VC, and then we switched to the "walk me through your resume" question.</p><p>Anyway, questions were:</p><p>1. Walk me through your resume<br>2. What do you specifically do at XYZ company and tell me about a project you did (I work in management consulting)<br>3. Tell me about a time when you had to convince your client to accept your recommendations<br>4. Short-, long-term career goals and why<br>5. Why Kellogg?<br>6. What do you do outside work<br>7. Tell me about a show you and your team put together (I mentioned at college I was crazy for stage management and theatrical production)</p><p>We then spent quite some time going through my questions for him. I asked about his start-up, the idea, addressable market, how Kellogg has helped him during the process, etc, followed by some common questions about Kellogg community and life.</p><p>My interview was about 50 minutes and the vibe was very casual and good. </p><p>Hope this helps and good luck! </p><p>--------------------------------------</p><p>原文引自：<br><a href="https://forum.chasedream.com/thread-1240257-1-1.html">https://forum.chasedream.com/thread-1240257-1-1.html</a></p><p>参与讨论及查看更多的相关文章请访问【北美MBA申请区】<br><a href="https://forum.chasedream.com/forum-13-1.html">https://forum.chasedream.com/forum-13-1.html</a></p></div>

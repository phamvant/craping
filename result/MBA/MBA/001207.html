<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>今天面了Foster，但是不是admission interview，收到学校的邮件是这么说的：</p><p>Dear 问啊问啊,<br>Thank you for applying to the Foster School of Business Full-time MBA Program at the University of Washington. We are currently in the process of reviewing the applications received on January 15th, and you have been selected to participate in a video interview. This is different from an admission interview in that the questions have been pre-recorded and you will record the video on your own time. Once you have completed your video, it will be added to your application for further review. Please note that some candidates who complete the video interview may still be invited to complete a formal admission interview at a later date, as we continue issuing invitations throughout the review period.<br>The video interview invitation and instructions will be sent out via e-mail later today, and your deadline to complete the video is Wednesday, February 10th. You will find detailed instructions on completing the video interview once you register using the link provided in the e-mail. If you do not receive the invitation e-mail within the next 24 hours, first check your junk mail folder. Gmail users may also want to check the “promotions” tab if the e-mail does not show up in your main inbox.<br>Thank you again for your interest in Foster. We look forward to getting to know you better!<br>Sincerely,<br>Foster MBA Admissions<br><a href="mailto:mba@uw.edu">mba@uw.edu</a><br>206-543-4661</p><p>-------------------</p><p>然后我准备了几天今天就开始做题了，结果只有两个问题：（<br>1. Tell me about something you learnt in the recent years that is important to you.<br>2. What is the leadership style of your supervisor, and what would you wish your supervisor to improve.</p><p>感受：<br>这些题目都是提前录制好的，而且画面色彩看起来非常渣，像是好几年前录的（夸张的说：想向下我们现在回看TVB剧的那个色彩），我认为是有个题库，只要大家收到video interview的都积极po题，应该能积累到足够的样本供大家练习</p><p>但是万变不离其宗，正如introduction里director说了，考察aaa，bbb，ccc，但更重要的是主要是考察你的storytelling skills。所以不管它问什么问题，都能用一个故事很好的回答才是根本。平时饭桌上大家可以有意无意的练习这种技能，跟朋友聊天也是，每次轮到你说话，控制在1：30到2：00内，用故事描述的STAR方式聊天</p><p>我的第二个问题很有意思，明则问你老板的领导力风格，实则测试你自己希望成为什么样的领导，以及你对领导的不足是如何巧妙提出的，很刁钻的一个问题。但是大家平时工作中应该都有想过，所以我也不多说啥了</p><p>--------------------------------------</p><p>原文引自：<br><a href="https://forum.chasedream.com/thread-1242427-1-1.html">https://forum.chasedream.com/thread-1242427-1-1.html</a></p><p>参与讨论及查看更多的相关文章请访问【北美MBA申请区】<br><a href="https://forum.chasedream.com/forum-13-1.html">https://forum.chasedream.com/forum-13-1.html</a></p></div>

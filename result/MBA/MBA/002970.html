<h1 class="aTitle">INSEAD MBA vs. HEC MBA + experience</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>I've just received the mail from my coordinator Jamine Sim. am still too excited and need to calm myself down... i think all the hard work has finally paid off. I was going to pay the HEC deposit tomorrow morning, but now i guess i might better think twice which one to choose. </p>
<p>My back ground: 28yrs old; bachelor in enginering from 211+985; master in engineering from the french engineering Ecole, full industry scholarship; one year internship in technical consulting in Paris; 2.5 yrs WE to now in a french automotive company working on R&amp;D, 1/4 time in france and 3/4 time in china; other international experiences in several EU countries but only short period (industrial placement / exchange) ... ; GMAT 740 6.0; T waived ... </p>
<p>I studied on the GMAT test for around 2 or 3 months starting from Aug.2011. It was painstaking. Test was taken in Oct. Applied only 2 b schools: HEC and INSEAD, both in France. Got admitted by HEC in Dec. as I remember... and from last night I saw lots of ppl starting to receive the offer, and today I was refreshing my Gmail inbox like crazy during the whole day even if I knew it was not working hour yet in France.... and eventually I've received the offer. I decide to give Jamine a big hug when I go to Fontainbleau soon in the summer... :) </p>
<p>For the interviews, I do find that the HEC ones more challenging than the INSEAD interviews... For HEC, the 2 alumni didn't show great interest in my 10-min ppt presentation, and they were really tring hard to dig deep into my career ambitions and all the other details... I was almost sweatering after the 1-hour tough time ... By the way, one of them is an entrepreneur in red wine business and was previous vp of LV Asia, the other one was global purchasing director of a F500. </p>
<p>The INSEAD interviews were much more pleasant as I feel. The 2 alumni were very nice. One of them happen to be acquainted with my boss, however at that moment my boss did not know that I was applying for MBA yet (was afraid that it jepadize my current career in the company...) .. but everything else of the 2 interviews were really great and pleasant. I think I'm gonna write them an email to inform my admission result, and to see if there is any chance to buy them a coffee sometime :) One of the alumni was CEO of an industrial company, the other one working in top IB. </p>
<p>So, for the interviews or the application assessment, they want see that you are the kind of person that always among the best ones wherever you were in the past. Anyway, I'm in!!! And for now, Im really concerning which MBA should I take. Although I know that INSEAD is better. But ... a lot of my colleagues (mostly french) suggest me go to HEC. Even one of the INSEAD interviewers also told me that HEC might be a better choice if I want to stay in the french industry ... I guess I need to think twice. But tomorrow is the last day to pay the HEC deposit ... For me, compared to INSEAD, HEC has certain strengths in terms of: 1)strong link with the french industry, 2)rich resource of double degree programs and exchanges, 3)internship opportunities, 4)bilingal option 5)influential in the french world ... For INSEAD, everyone knows its strength in consulting, diversity and international scope... and it ranks much better than HEC. So i'm 60% for INSEAD and 40% for HEC, for the moment. But anyway, I will go to the bank tomorrow morning to pay the 6000E either to HEC or to INSEAD. </p>
<p>I think my background is quite modest compared to the other INSEAD admitted guys. and so i feel lucky, and am really happy to get into both HEC an INSEAD... OK now Im calmed down a little bit and wish you all good luck for your application :)</p>

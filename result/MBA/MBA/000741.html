<h1 class="aTitle">USC Full-Time MBA interview on Campus [2014-03-01]</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>Sorry for the late post. My interview took place on campus 3/1 </p><p>They didn't allow me to choose the Skype interview, instead I had to fly over from Asia and spend $$$ to have a quick 30 minute chat with a 2nd yr student. I'm not sure if they are testing my loyalty for this school. (J/K)</p><p>They have a 2nd year student to walk you into a small room and just chat with you regarding your background and experience. </p><p>here are the questions</p><ol><li>Walk me through your career to date?</li><li>Why MBA? Why Now?</li><li>Give me an example when you led a team? what contribution did you make? and what was your role?</li><li>give me a time where you working on a difficult team? and how did you handle it?</li><li>What is your short term and long term career goals?</li><li>What clubs will you join?</li><li>What challenges you at work?</li><li>Any questions for me?</li></ol><p>The 2nd year student started to chat with me about housing, and her background with in consulting and she want it to do Entertainment. she successfully landed a job at NBC. One of her classmates find a internship at Disney. </p><p>No extraordinary question, but the experience was horrible, from my drive around the neighborhood to the inside facilities. I can't feel the personal attention they keep on advertise on (close knit collaborative group) Maybe, I wasn't in a class that day.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess when business schools emphasis the fit, they really mean it, Don't get me wrong, USC is a great school but I can't see myself spend 150k for two years at USC. I don't want to talk bad things about USC but I can definitely tell why the drop in ranking lately and the job placement % rate drop. Personally, I think MBA is more for learning from each other rather than heated competitions, when I was there for my interview the Indian brothers waiting for the interview look at me as if I was going to take one of their spots in the full time program. ( Of course, it is a competitive nature, but come on, can you see yourself working with these people in the future? I know it's only one or two individual. You're there to acquire new skills and build lasting friendships with people who share common interests with you) One thing I know for sure is most of us Chinese students only see the rankings and reputation of the school, sometimes we forget about the ROI, the fit, and what can the school really do for you? (only my personal thoughts) please don't attack me.<img alt="" src="https://forum.chasedream.com/static/image/smiley/default/titter.gif" border="0" smilieid="9"></p><p>--------------------------------------</p><p>原文引自：<br><a href="https://forum.chasedream.com/thread-897644-1-1.html">https://forum.chasedream.com/thread-897644-1-1.html</a></p><p>参与讨论及查看更多的相关文章请访问【北美MBA申请区】<br><a href="https://forum.chasedream.com/forum-13-1.html">https://forum.chasedream.com/forum-13-1.html</a></p></div>

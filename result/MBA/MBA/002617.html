<h1 class="aTitle">In @ HBS + Interview Questions for HBS &amp; MIT LGO</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>Still digesting the news... Good that the adcom actually calls to confirm the offer otherwise I kept thinking that I mis-read the decision! :D</p>
<p>Have been lurking on CD for a long while. The information on the forum was really helpful for my application. And the courage and company of the CD'ers really inspired me from going further... making this whole journey much easier.</p>
<p>Thanks whoever posted this phrase in the forum: Don't ding yourself before others ding you! - I didn't plan to apply for HBS at all. Until I saw this. I went through the program and asked myself: do I really want to be educated this way, let alone the fame of HBS? The answer was, yes, I want it. Then that phrase gave me the courage to try.</p>
<p>Some profile info for reference:<br>Female, undergrad SJTU, graduate in France. GPA is never better than 3.2.<br>3.5 working experience in the UK, oil and gas industry. Work mainly involves in process improvement.<br>G760+6, T118.</p>
<p><strong>Interview questions from HBS in London:</strong></p>
<p>- Talk me through how you end up where you are.- It's really about personal experience and the decision process along the way I suppose.<br>- Asked me something that stands out in my CV... and asked why I think I am good at it.<br>- Tell me about your comany, your industry, and your competitors. What does your company do?<br>- In your opinion, what does your company not do, but should do?<br>- Do you believe in what you are doing will make a difference for your company?<br>- What do you want to do after graduating from HBS? In long term?<br>- What kind of news do you follow? (There's your book question!)</p>
<p>The whole session was 30 min sharp. The interviewer was really friendly and complimented me all the time, making the conversation very relaxed. I felt good connection with my interviewer. Guess was just lucky!</p>
<p><strong>Tips of interview?</strong> As many people mentioned, know yourself, and be yourself probably is the most important. No surprise or trap questions. The interviewer showed genuine interest in knowing me - which is nice!</p>
<p><strong>Was also interviewed for MIT LGO program</strong> - didn't get in at the end. But thought I'd share interview experience with those who want to try in the future! Questions:</p>
<p>- Which three LGO partnership companies do you want to do your internship for?<br>- Tell me about a time when you have an incompetent team member, but you still need to complete the task.<br>- Tell me about a time that you failed to meet the target / expectation. How does your manager / colleagues react to the result?<br>- Tell me about a time that you are in a conflict with your colleague / manager.<br>- Tell me about a time that you have to lead a team in which your team members don't get along well / in conflict.<br>- Anything that you wish me to ask you?</p>
<p>Yes it was the daunting behaviorial interview - and I was put off a bit because I felt the interviewer is rather going through a process than trying to know me. I didn't make the connection with the interviewer and shine through. Guess lessons learned... I over prepared and prepared all sorts of stories I could find on the internet. Must have made my response sound like reciting from a book. And for those I haven't prep'ed for, it was obvious! :) MIT is the most organized, structural MBA program that I've seen. Something that I always wished I could be... but alas, I never am. :)</p>
<p>HBS is the last school I'm waiting answer for. I'm dinged by four other schools already. I was ready for a "no" when I saw the decision letter. But that was the time I told myself all is not lost. The long process of application made me understand better about myself and what I want. I become more determined on pursuing what I want to achieve in life. This was the most important thing of the process, regardless of the result. - I consider myself a very lucky girl, but hey, want to share these thoughts with the courageous CD'ers on the way. </p>

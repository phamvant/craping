<p>Thoughts:&nbsp; <br>
Since the interviewer works for venture capital, heconstantly reminded me the difference of “dream” and reality.&nbsp; So while I was mentioning my goals, theinterviewer was kindly giving some of the feedback, and helped me to realizewhat is practical and what is not. During the entire process, not only theinterviewer was able to carefully pay attention to all my answers, but alsogiving out suggestions for my career goals. </p>
<p>I had sent him a thank you note and received a nice reply. </p>

Theinterviewer liked that I did not send her entire package of my applicationessays (apparently a lot of other of other interviewees did).&nbsp; She like the way how I presented myself inperson.&nbsp;&nbsp; She also gave a lot of adviceon the language qualification section (you need to speak at least threelanguages in order to receive a degree from INSEAD).</p>

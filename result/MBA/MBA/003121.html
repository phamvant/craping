<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>报过offer了，但是拖了很久，受版主要求，记几笔申请总结吧。希望来年的同学们都能有好的收获</p>
<p>背景：PKU 金融本科，IBD 2年，PE 2年；G/T 710 113；GPA 3.3<br>申请：Stanford / HBS / CBS (Rugular Round) / Booth / Wharton<br>面试：HBS / CBS / Booth / Wharton<br>Decline w interview： HBS / Booth<br>Decline w/o interview: Stanford <br>WL：CBS<br>in @ wharton w/ $$</p>
<p>去年十月中旬决定要申请的，10月22号考T（G在四年前考过了），出了成绩之后开始一边工作一边选校、写essay、找推荐人。<br>明白自己GT和GPA都不高，也没办法花100%的精力，所以整个过程很平和，没有找中介，仅把这段经历当作整理心情和重新认识自己的过程。由于反复叨扰一些朋友，也多了一些深交的好伙伴，算是一大收获。</p>

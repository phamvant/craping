<h1 class="aTitle">Berkeley Haas MBA 面经分享</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>是去学校面的，当时对Haas的感受特别好，因为天气好，大家都挂着笑容，又有幸去到Super Saturday面试。全天的活动学校都特别精心安排，有很多在读的学生来跟我们social，组织了好几个panel帮大家放松，认识彼此，认识学校。还特意安排了整个Berkeley的tour，给我们Tour差不多一个半小时的领队还是本科的president of students, 特别nice的一个小姑娘。Tour真的非常impressive，学校感觉超大超有文化，总之当时就觉得能进Berkeley就太酷了！（这也是后来我为啥这么纠结选校的原因吧）</p>
<p>去了之后我就在ClearAdmit发了篇面经。如下：</p>
<p>I was invited to the super Saturday interview hosted on campus on Feb 20.The events were very well organized, and the interview was just a very smallpart of the experience. The adcom and current students hosted lunches,different panels for team work and student life, and everyone we met was verykind and helpful. The interview was with an alumnus who graduated in 2012 andworks in a similar industry. The interview was blind, my interviewer had myrésumé with him but he barely looked at it or asked any questions directly frommy résumé. It was very conversational and open. The whole interview processtook about 45 minutes.</p>
<p>A few questions during the interview:</p>
<ol>
<li>Walk me through your résumé.</li>
<li>Why MBA, why Haas?</li>
<li>Did you ever had an experience that your idea was different fromeveryone else and you convinced other teammates to work with you? How did youdo it?</li>
<li>What is your leadership style? Give me an example.</li>
<li>A specific question for my past working experience in the industry we workin.</li>
<li>Any questions for me?</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, I feel like Haas is a close knit community with very kind people.Haas didn’t really talk a lot about team work, but I (and a few otherapplicants) feel that Haas is definitely the school who “talk the talk and walkthe walk,” with people who truly wish you the best and help where they can. Ireally enjoyed the weekend out in San Francisco. Weather was perfect and everyone I met was wonderful and nice. We had a campus tour and class visit thefollowing Monday. I was very impressed by how beautiful and how huge the campusis! Very informative undergrad Haas tour guide too! </p>

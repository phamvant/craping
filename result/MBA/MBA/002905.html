<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>MSU 2/7</p>
<p>12:30 p.m. (technically 2/8)</p>
<p>Skype interview</p>
<p>Length: 15 min.</p>
<p>1. tell me about your social activities.</p>
<p>2. your internship experiences.</p>
<p>3. other questions you wanna ask</p>
<p>p.s. I don’t know why this interview is this short, but she seemed in a hurry and didn’t want you to talk too much.</p>
<p>4. what role has performing arts had in your life such as acting in a drama? ( this one was sent to me as the topic for an essay which I have to finish within 2 hours and send my answer to her email.)</p>
<p>p.p.s. I was extremely tired and sleepy at night especially after a whole day’s work. It’s not easy to get myself excited at 12p.m. but I guess I was ok as I washed up my face before the interview. I think my performance was so-so, but she said I am good at interviewing when answering my question about job opportunities. That’s good news, isn’t it? Ha</p>

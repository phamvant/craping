<h1 class="aTitle">[已录] WPI 伍斯特理工 MSMI 面经 [2018.03.16]</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>感谢CD当时看面经就准备了这六个，真正面试的时候三个还是四个问题全中了。一开始会有一些练习的面试题，比如让你讲个有意思的故事之类的，我没准备说的还不好有点担心，实际录视频的时候因为问题都准备了就好很多。WPI这个只能录一遍不能重复，所以一定要做好准备再开始视频。说几个注意事项：
 </p>
<ol>
  <li>事先多看几遍introduction视频，记住WPI的全称读发和自己申请的专业避免尴尬。 </li>
  <li>条件允许开个word小窗把（关键词）打出来，作为提醒自己的点。注意千万不要通篇打出来，你读或者找句子的眼神，迟疑的几秒人家一下就看出来了。</li>
  <li>问题是以视频的方式提问的，一位老师会说出问题（只有一遍抓关键点），视频结束后你开始说。 </li>
  <li>时间很短应该是60-90s，尽量语速快一点，但也不用rush，他们除了听答案也是观察你在摄像头前的表现。 </li>
</ol>
<p>以下是CD版主们总结的问题，我准备面试时自己随便敲的答案：</p>
<ol>
  <li>Dreaming Career？
    My dreaming career is to establish my own business at my middle age.
    Before that I have to work hard to accumulate my wealth, experience and connections, foundation of my future success.
    The strong alumni of HIT and WPI can provide great chances for me to meet great people with different skills but same value.
    A team will be setup, and I will lead my team, use everything I learned in WPI such as negotiation, communication and other analyzing skills to raise funds, develop products and sell them to the right people. </li>
  <li>这个program如何帮助达成goal? / Why this program? Why WPI?
    I choose WPI because it enjoys high prestige, accepted and respected by the whole world. It’s really kind of honor to further my study in here. It’s academic-oriented atmosphere is really close to my undergraduate school HIT, when we are doing sth we mean it. I really like this serious spirit. And the climate of New York state is another factor since I came form the very northeast of China.

  <li>在一个怎么样的group task里面，你做了什么让这个task成功？ </li>
  <li>在学习工作之外，最喜欢什么activity？    Photograph: First cam from dad (stock)

    Exciting to catch splendid moments in my life
  love of life: passion achieve everything and fear nothing</li>
  <li>Describe team work
    Vital, Strategy, solution: one can never achieve
    The power of teamwork is far more greater than the sum of every single one.
    Secret of teamwork: is to put the right one in the right position (learn lesson from my own exp)
    Avoid mistakes: clash of personalities, conflict of timetable/tasks
  Teammate: just do your job; head: control the whole progress and be responsible for your choice</li>

<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>周一面完就一直在出差，申请总算全部结束了。把体会最深刻的这次面经贴出来。</p>
<p>面试官是这几年一直在上海面试的Eileen Chang. 问的问题非常的多也很深刻，30分钟问了差不多17-18道题目。基本能问的都问了。总结一下就是生活了25年的逻辑全部被挑战了一遍，内心深处的东西被剥开仔细检查了一遍。</p>
<p>在外面等候大厅寒暄了一会，自我调侃了一下我中文名字的发音方法，讨论了一下房间很热，要开门通风还是有点私秘性，面试官就开始介绍了面试流程和目的，HBS的面试也是作为申请材料的一部分，最后放在材料里一起才决定录取的</p>

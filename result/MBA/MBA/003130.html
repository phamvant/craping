<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>We are thinking of the Class of 2015 application process as three stages:</p>
<p><strong>1. Introduce Yourself</strong></p>
<p>This is the written application. These are the components:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the demographic data gathering you expect!</li>
<li>Resume</li>
<li>Transcripts of academic work</li>
<li>GMAT/GRE test scores</li>
<li>2 <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/mba/admissions/writtenapplication.html" target="_blank">essay questions</a></li></ul>
<p><strong>2. Tell Us More</strong></p>
<p>This is the interview process. Interviews are:</p>
<ul>
<li>By invitation only after review of written application</li>
<li>On our campus or in TBD hub city locations, or in some cases, Skype</li>
<li>30 minutes</li>
<li>Conducted by members of our Admissions Board</li></ul>
<p><strong>3. Have the Last Word</strong></p>
<p>This is new. AFTER the interview, candidates are asked to do a written reflection on the interview experience which will be submitted via the online application system. This is a chance for you to have the "last word," so to speak.</p>
<p>We'll be hosting weekly Q+A webinar sessions beginning on June 1 at 12:00 noon, Boston time. Subsequent webinar sessions will be held through the summer on Thursdays at 1:00pm, Boston time. To sign up, please visit our <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/mba/admissions/events.html" target="_blank">Events</a> page.</p>
<p>We will hold on-campus admissions information sessions throughout the summer every Monday and Friday at 1:00 pm, Boston time. No advance registration required. For details, please see our <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/mba/admissions/visit.html" target="_blank">Visit HBS</a> page.</p>
<p>Our process is the product of an admissions team that is always in design/development mode. All throughout the year we meet and dream up ways that will make it easier for you to feel "understood" and undertake assessment steps that map to what we do here in the classroom and what you will do in your careers. We're always trying to tweak and improve, and this is what we've come up with for the Class of 2015. Welcome to the starting gate.</p>

<h1 class="aTitle">2004 the WSJ recruiters MBA Ranking</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>The National and Regional rankings are both determined by how recruiters rate each M.B.A. program on 20 different attributes, their future plans to recruit students from the school, and the number of survey respondents who said they have recruited recently at the school. Business schools in the National ranking tend to attract a relatively large number of recruiters, many of whom come from national and multinational companies and pay high salaries. M.B.A. programs in the Regional ranking are more likely to bring in recruiters from their region than the schools in the National ranking. They also generally have smaller M.B.A. enrollments and attract fewer recruiters than the National schools.</p>

<p><strong>THE TOP INTERNATIONAL SCHOOLS</strong></p>
<p>This ranking includes European and North American schools that have a global pool of recruiters. It is based on how recruiters rated each school on 20 different attributes, their future plans to recruit students from the school, and the number of countries from which the school draws recruiters. To be eligible for the ranking, a school needed respondents from at least four countries to say in the survey that they had recruited there recently.</p>

<p>New York City is the home of investment banking and most other financial services, so it should come as no surprise that it’s the home of the best business schools for employability in banking.&nbsp; Columbia Business School and NYU Stern School of Business are No. 1 and No. 2 in New York City, as well as in the Northeast and nationally.&nbsp; NYU Stern even scores the No. 1 spot in San Francisco and No. 3 in the West.&nbsp; Columbia also makes it into the Top 5 in the Midwest and Southeast.</p>
<p>How important is business school prestige in banking employability?But don’t think you won’t get anywhere in finance without a NYC MBA.&nbsp; The finance industry is not as geographically focused as the legal industry and lacks the prestige obsession of consulting.&nbsp; Aside from the broad geographic reach of New York schools, employment patterns in finance show a slight regional tilt.&nbsp; In each region, a local school is No. 1 in our employability rankings.</p>

<h1 class="aTitle">TUCK - Briefing of Top Business Schools 2</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>Recently&nbsp;I am reading "Your MBA Game Plan". It is quite well written, and it provides a lot of information. There is one section in the book that introduces the differences among all the top schools. I try to transfer some of the information to CD so you all can take a look at. Credits are given to the authors of the book: Omari Bouknight &amp; Scott Shrum. Please do not use the following excerpt for any business purposes. And Mr. Zeros please erase this message if copyright is concerned.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to scan the book. So I have to type the entire passage from scratch. It is impossible for me to finish all 30 schools in a short period of time since I myself am in the application process too. So I will do one school each time. Response which schools you want to read first. I will work on the school that gets the most responses. Certainly if someone here has the same book and would like to share the excerpts, you are more than welcome to add the schools.</p>
<p>Please pardon my typos. I type it, not just copy and paste.</p>
<p>2. TUCK: My most favourite school. TUCK rockSSSSSS!!!</p>
<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="5"><strong>Tuck</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Think Small. Think intimate. Think great outdoors. That's exactly what life at Tuck is all about. The country's first graduate school of business offers one of the smallest programs among the top 30 schools, with fewer than 250 students in each class. The small class size – coupled with the school’s location in rural Hanover, New Hampshire – results in a close-knit community in which everyone knows everyone else.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Academically, Tuck's MBA program focuses on turning out competent general managers. Most of the first year curriculum consists of core courses in the main management disciplines, with the second year left open for electives. No specific majors are offered. First year students complete most of their coursework in the same study group, which Tuck emphasizes as a way for students to grow closer and develop their teamwork skills. More than the average top program, Tuck is looking for students who demonstrate strong teamwork skills, so make sure that this is a main theme in your Tuck application.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Tuck is also serious about leadership, and one unique part of the first year experience is the Tuck Leadership Forum, which runs throughout the first year. The Forum is a series of mini-courses in topics such as management communication and entrepreneurial management, al designed to help improve students' leadership skills. Students then complete a team project, such as creating a business plan or doing consulting work for an existing business. The program also provides students with a chance to work closely with faculty and plug into Tuck's alumni network while still in school.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Speaking of the alumni, what Tuck lacks in size is made up for in devotion. Tuck's alumni have been described by some as fierce in their loyalty to the school and to each other. Tuck touts its alumni's 60 percent plus annual giving rate as further evidence of this dedication. While the school may not have alum in every company, Tuck students are known to get good results from the alumni they do call upon. In your own application, make sure that you can provide convincing proof that you, too, will be active alum, preferably by demonstrating loyalty to your undergraduate school.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Tuck's remote location means that it is not for everyone. Some applicants, especially those with spouses, often find it difficult to relocate to Hanover. To its credit, Tuck goes out of its way to make the transition a smooth one, often providing spouses and partners with fulltime work around campus. Still, only slightly more than half of Tuck's admitted applicants actually enroll in the program. This means two things for you: 1 Make sure that you really want to attend Tuck before you apply. It's a great school, but its size and location sometimes turn people off. Save yourself a lot of time if your think these aspects of the program will be a problem for you. 2. Even more importantly, you really need d to demonstrate why Tuck is for you. Tuck's students tend to be passionate about their school, and you need to demonstrate this same passion in your application. Visiting the school – especially for your interview – can go a long way toward helping you make your case. Also, think about applying in Tuck’s Early Action round if you are sure that Tuck is where you want to be. This relatively new program is a great chance for you to show your commitment to the school.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Tuck isn't the household name that Stanford and Harvard are, but its general management program is known to be one of the best in the country. Tuck graduates have a strong reputation in consulting and financial services, particularly on the East Coast, where nearly two-thirds of its graduates end up living after school. If you are considering a career in general management, or are interested in consulting or banking, don’t overlook Tuck. If you can demonstrate that the school’s environment is right for you, and make a case for why the general management approach is what you want out of business school, then Tuck will give your application strong consideration</font></p>

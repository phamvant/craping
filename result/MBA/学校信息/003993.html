<p>Re: Calling MIT Sloan 2010 Fall Applicants - 15-02-2010, 11:54 AM</p>
<p>Dear Puys...</p>
<p>I know i hope you would have gone through this info but just re-iterating the admission process.</p>
<p>RG: Okay. I’ll start from the application deadline. The first thing we do is import the data to our own database. And even though it’s a paperless application, we print everything and the data is loaded into the database.</p>
<p>The first person to see the application is me. I review each application online and distribute them for reading to members of the committee. They are distributed randomly, by the way. And our readers are all internal – we don’t use students or alumni. The reviewers are all internal staff along with some contract readers – so it’s entirely controlled by us.</p>
<p>The readers pick up a batch of 20, 25, or 40 applications depending on how fast they read. And then a week later they come back with the applications they have scored, and those scores are recorded. From there, I will go into the database and look at the scores, and based on those scores, about 18 percent will be invited for an interview.</p>
<p>That's right. We score the applications. We don’t have a global rating. Instead, we score every attribute. <u>There are about nine that we look at, ranging from GMAT score to GPA to work success to all the other attributes, like leadership attributes. Essentially there are two major groups of attributes – demonstrated success (GMAT, GPA, work success) and then the leadership attributes. We add up the sum of the two scores, and based on those two scores I will decide the 18 percent who will be invited for an interview</u>.</p>
<p>Is it always 18 percent? No. The size of the class is constant – 324 MBAs plus roughly 50 in our Leaders in Manufacturing dual-degree program. The other number that is constant is the number of people we will interview. Basically, we interview no more than 800. So depending on the total number of applications we receive, the percentage of candidates that are invited for an interview varies. But it is no more than 800 people, and from there we will admit slightly more than half.</p>
<p>We could interview 1000, even 2000, but we can’t ever offer more than 500 spots, so our strategy is to do the selection at the interview stage. And that’s my job, to find the 18 percent or 800 candidates we will interview.<br>They are then interviewed by members of committee. Committee members will score them again, and based on those scores, we will pick the 50 percent to admit.</p>
<p>It’s actually quite easy. We don’t spend a lot of time debating because we can refer to something specific in the application. Either it’s there or it’s not there. We don’t say, “I like this person because this person is outgoing.” We don’t do it that way. We say we like this person because this person has a high competency in creativity, or relationship building, or goal setting, or influencing. (Those are all among the leadership attributes we consider.)<br>It’s a sensible process based on tangible considerations. So when someone says, “Why was this person not admitted?” we can really pinpoint where this particular applicant stood out or didn’t came up short.</p>

<p>I hope this answers the bucketing question asked earlier.</p>

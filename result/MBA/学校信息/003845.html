<h1 class="aTitle">visiting Wharton, Kellogg and HBS</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>NEW POST (April 28, 06)</p>
<p>Just got back from my visit to the US this week.&nbsp; Yes, I ended up visiting Wharton, Kellogg and HBS.&nbsp;It was a really exhausting trip, but it does help me clear out a couple of my questions about each school.&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who wants to know where i will be attending this fall, my answer is HBS!&nbsp; </p>
<p>I just think it fits my personality and exceeded my expectation.&nbsp; The campus is so beautiful that it looks like museums, not to mention that there are so many protagonist actually come on campus to discuss the case with you in almost every class (You can ask question directly to the protagonist... remember they are all CFOs, CEOs of the company that HBS prepared the case for).&nbsp;&nbsp; I am totally impressed with how all the students are participating in class.&nbsp; BTW, almost half of the class were graduating from "Prestigous" university.. really..all brand name university.</p>
<p>As for Wharton, it is very very strong in Finance.&nbsp; With my limited (really!) finance background, I don't really understand what the profs are talking about... but from what it sounds, it is really good!&nbsp; If you are seriously looking to go into banking and anything to do with Finance, this is a school that will provide you with all the hard skills in this arena.&nbsp; Not too sure with Wharton's marketing program --&gt; especially when they claim they are very strong in Marketing (I seriously doubt it!)&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean it is just not the right school for u if you are looking to go into marketing period.&nbsp; Students are very competitive at Wharton (even more than HBS).&nbsp; Most of them work in New York (I'm sure they know what the finance profs are talking about). They really like to win and they certainly are very successful in their field/job. </p>
<p>Kellogg is a very traditional place to be... They have very nice professor and students.&nbsp; They are much more relax about school and life (which means a lot less competitive).&nbsp; I actually like the professor at Kellogg, but I am not sure how hard the course material are... I guess i can learn 80% of everything from Kellogg through reading business books (good books of course).&nbsp; </p>
<p>Finally, it really comes down to what you really want to be.. what your personality is like? How u fit into the school culture?&nbsp; Think carefully before you apply and this might help u get the most out of the MBA education.</p>
<p>Ciao, </p>

<p>Thanks</p></div>
<p>I think all 3 schools (HBS, Wharton, Kellogg) have very different style and focus.&nbsp; I used very much the same essays for all my applications, but I am a very passionate person so i guess none of the school really dislike this quality.&nbsp; </p>
<p>At interview, I "tailor-made" myself to be someone that fits perfectly with their culture (esp if you are interviewing with the adcom).&nbsp; At my Kellogg interview, I focus more on my contribution to community and my involvement at extracurricular at my undergraduate program.&nbsp; At my Wharton interview, I come through as a well-rounded person that knows what my career direction and goals are.&nbsp; Because my goal is to be an entrepernuer, I intentionally discuss a couple of business ideas with my interviewer.&nbsp;&nbsp; At my HBS interview, I make sure I am a very focus and confident person.&nbsp; My answers were very specific to the questions asked. Also I made up my mind on one decision/solution even though it seems like i haven't thought about every aspects of the business.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you use this approach, however, you have to provide very strong supporting on why you pick this decision/solution.&nbsp; Basically, you have to sound very analytical and confident. </p>
<p>In short, you have to slightly modified your style to make you "fit in" to the school culture.&nbsp; This is what "REAL MARKETING" is all about.&nbsp; It's about positioning the product (applicant) to fill consumer (adcom) needs. </p>
<p>Hope this helps!!</p>

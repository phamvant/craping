<h1 class="aTitle">some thoughts about Kellogg</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>I went to Kellogg's MBA info. section two days ago. The section was run in Goldman Sach's office. (GS has a really really nice office in downtown manhattan, they are damned rich.....) To be honest, Kellogg's alumni are one of the brightest bschool alumni&nbsp; I've met so far. (I've met Chicago's, and Duke's, and Columbia's. Will meet Tuck's Stanford's and Wharton's later). Six alumni attended the info. section. (2 blacks, 1 spanish/black cant really tell, 1 white, 1 greek, and 1 chinese) They are all intelligent and down to earth. two of them are bankers, one is a consultant, one is founding an actor school in new york, one is opening a winery in Harlem, and the last one, a chinese guy, who was an ex-banker, is running his private equity firm in Connecticut. Surprisingly, this chinese guy was an international student. He attended K in 1997. worked in Chase Manhattan bank for a few years before he runs his own firm. His English is really fluent, and his jokeS cracked us up. They are indeed the most down to earth bschool students I've met so far. (I am not trying to badmouth the other schools. Will apologize if someone is offended)</p>
<p>They didnt focus on k's strenght very much, which is their marketing. Instead, they spent a great deal of time on presenting their finance program, which is the most popular program in kellogg. They also talked about Kellogg's diverse culture so much. They talked about their students-run events in Kellogg, their drinking stories, and their teamwork spirit. That night was full of jokes and laughter. It was a great evening. My conclusion for those kellogg-wanna-be is that you really need to bring up your uniqueness and teamwork oriented stories to Kellogg instead of your excellent analytical or alone wolf type leadership skills. </p>
<p>Good Luck!!</p>

<h1 class="aTitle">Kellog - Briefing of Top Business Schools - 12</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>The two words you will almost always hear when you mention Kellogg are "teamwork" and "marketing." Donald Jacobs, the school's dean from 1975 to 2001, is responsible for establishing the school as a top-ranked MBA program, and he did it largely on the strength of his philosophy that business managers can't be effective without knowing how to successfully work in teams. Even though Jacobs is no longer involved in the day-to-day running of the school (he's retained the title of Dean Emeritus), his approach is still very apparent in the school's program and culture. Most homework assignments and projects are done in teams, and the school has recently instituted a Web-based peer review system called TeamNet, which students are required to use in some of their classes.</p>
<p>Marketing is the school's other best-known strength, and much of the credit for that goes to Philip Kotler, who has written some of the best-known Marketing text books in the world. The rest of the Marketing faculty includes many other heavy-hitters who have distinguished themselves in their own right. All of this leads to heavy recruiting from companies looking for Marketing experts and brand managers.</p>
<p>Lost in the noise about Kellogg's Marketing program is the fact that its other programs are also very strong. In fact, Marketing isn't even the school's most popular major; more Kellogg students study Finance than anything else. Although Kellogg's curriculum is considered to be General Management in nature, students generally specialize in two or three fields.</p>
<p>The school also has noted faculty in areas such as Strategy and Managerial Economics. Just as Finance is a more popular major at Kellogg than Marketing, the biggest recruiters at the other top schools—McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group, Goldman Sachs, etc.—also do more hiring at Kellogg than the biggest marketing-related firms.</p>
<p>As you would expect, Kellogg's admissions office looks for teamwork-oriented applicants. "Sharks" or hot shots need not apply. This doesn't mean that Kellogg looks for 600 touchy-feely people each year, but rather, it looks for applicants who know how to get things done when working with others. Think of the "desert island test"—if you can think of someone whom you'd hate to be stranded with on an island, then Kellogg probably doesn't want that person, either.</p>
<p>Maybe even more importantly, Kellogg looks for people who will get involved at the school. A distinguishing characteristic of Kellogg is that pretty much everything is student-run, from clubs to international study trips ("Global Initiatives in Management") to professional conferences that the school hosts. Chances are that a student will even review your application. It's not uncommon for a student to be involved in five or six different activities or clubs outside of the typical four-class schedule. What this means for you is that you need to demonstrate that you will get involved in your profession, school, and community. And less can be more: Instead of listing seven clubs that you once participated in while in college, focus on the one or two activities that you’re really passionate about and show exactly how you got involved in those activities and made a difference.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Although Kellogg is best known for its teamwork approach, the school is increasingly positioning itself less as a place where students learn to be team leaders, not merely team players. In other words, people who work well with others, but aren't just follow ers. The administration wants recruiters to come to Kellogg looking for their next generation of leaders, rather than for marketing or finance experts who are easy to get along with. That means that Kellogg is looking for more outstanding leaders in the applicant pool. To this end, think of personal examples of how you've led teams toward a goal in the past. Most applicants will just think about teamwork in terms of how they helped others accomplish a goal, but show the admissions committee how you led a team to success and you'll be in great shape.</p>

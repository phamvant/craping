<p>In a world filled with business schools, Haas maintains a high degree of distinction. That distinction can be seen just by reading through the Haas essays, which at times seem more like questions from a psychologist rather than from an admissions committee. Indeed, the essay questions are indicative of a school that is serious about admitting applicants who can maintain almost paradoxical balances—applicants who are committed to traditional business learning, but display a bit of personal panache. Applicants who would be willing to stand alone based on personal conviction, but are willing to unite in the name of teamwork. Applicants who are looking to make waves in the marketplace, but remain cognizant of social and ethical responsibilities. If you can paint a picture of yourself that reflects these traits, in addition to satisfying the more common admissions requirements, then you stand a good chance of being accepted into the Haas family.</p>
<p>The Haas learning model continues to emphasize three main themes: Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Management of Technology, and International Business Management. For the last several years, Haas has benefited from a symbiotic relationship with nearby Silicon Valley. This has resulted, not surprisingly, in an intensified focus on entrepreneurship. Haas now boasts multiple opportunities for students to cultivate and test their business ideas as well as to interact with mentors and experts. The Lester Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, founded in 1991, supports a variety of activities such as the Berkeley Business Incubator, UC Berkeley Entrepreneurs Forum, and entrepreneurship fellowships and internships.</p>
<p>Technology has also been a natural outgrowth of Haas' geographical location. The Management of Technology Program offers a number of opportunities including courses such as Strategic Computing and Communication Technology, Information Technology Strategy, and International Trade and Competition in High Technology. The program also features research initiatives, and the annual Leading Edge Technology Conference.</p>
<p>The final theme, International Business Management, is highlighted in Haas' course offerings in addition to its International Business Development (IBD) and International Exchange programs. IBD offers students the opportunity to participate in a global consulting project with a team composed entirely of Haas students. In terms of exchange programs, Haas offers six in locations such as London, Barcelona, and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Although the Haas learning model is rooted in general management precepts, students can obtain certificates in any one of the three themes in addition to Corporate Environmental Management and Health Management. Displaying an understanding of these themes and how they would benefit you should be a critical part of your application.</p>
<p>Demonstrating the teamwork dimension is also important, as Hass admissions counselors are actively looking for applicants who display team spirit. The learning model group assignments and interact closely with faculty. To demonstrate fit with these characteristics, you should display a pattern of getting involved and a sense of community. </p>
<p>The Haas learning model has a strong bent towards applying abstract theories to real-world situations. This approach begins with the faculty, a majority of whom have significant experience within the marketplace, and extends to the students, who boast an average of 5.2 years of work experience. The maturity dimension is highly valued at Haas and gaining acceptance with under three years of work experience can be challenging. As an applicant, you should try to display a diversity of experience and insight into how complex issues such as globalization, ethics, environmentalism, and politics impact business operations.</p>
<p>As other business schools scramble to revamp their programs in order to promote a new focus on ethics and social responsibility, Haas will benefit from its reputation as a pioneer in the field. With a required course in ethics, numerous electives, programs, and events focused on the topic, Haas gives full treatment to the interaction of business, ethics, and social responsibility. The National Social Venture Business Plan Competition is a hallmark of that interaction, as business schools across the country compete for a total of $100,000 by presenting plans that outline business propositions that have a societal or environmental component. Although a majority of Haas grads pursue careers in the traditional areas of consulting and finance, they all are all influenced by Haas' incorporation of social issues within the learning model. As you present you rprofile, make sure that you reflect a cognizance of societal and ethical issues that extend from business issues.</p>

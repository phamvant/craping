UNC Chapel Hill is at the center of Research Triangle Park (RTP) in North Carolina. The whole area is rapidly growing, and has been ranked as top 5 of most rapidly developing area in US, peered with Austin, Texas. The incoming population is sky rocketing, so does the real estate market needs. Both are great indicator of fast ecomonic development. climate wise, chapel hill is fantastic, especially for me who come from up state new york. The area is peacefull for a great study period and active enough that you won't be bored at all with friends, parties and outing!</p><p>The school itself has a very strong reputation in southern area of the US. For those want to stay post MBA, there will be vast opportunities across the country, thanks for Kenan-Flagler (KF) alumni networks. What you would gain the most from an MBA program is its alumni networks. An effective and friendly network is the key of success after the MBA. I heard the team spirit in my first visit at UNC KF B-school, this very strong tie of alumni and current student gets stronger and stronger when i'm getting close to my class of 2017. </p><p>Concentration wise, UNC KFBS is well know for marketing, finiance, healthcare, and consulting. In each of these areas, you will gain tremendous help from the successful alumni over the world, and with the top guidance from the industry leaders!

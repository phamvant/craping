<h1 class="aTitle">Darden - Briefing of Top Business Schools - 18</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>Upon visiting Darden, you will be immediately struck by three traits: the stunning campus, the dynamic classroom interactions, and the academic discipline. Each of these traits is rooted in closely-guarded tradition. While many business schools have changed their models over time to keep up with the latest fads, Darden has remained true to the ideals that have kept its students highly regarded as general managers. Your application should clearly display your fit with the Darden philosophy.</p>
<p>The central tenets of the Darden philosophy are based upon the close-knit feel of the school and the respect among students and faculty. Every weekday morning "First Coffee" is held, during which the Darden community sits down and discusses topics that are pertinent to the school. Students consistently rave about the bonds that are formed throughout their years at Darden, and the alumni are among the most committed to their alma mater. Indeed Darden has the highest endowment per alum of any of any business school. Although the class size is growing, the small school feeling remains. If you intend to get accepted, you should indicate your desire to become a member of this community, and provide examples of how you have and would be a contributing alum. A visit to the Darden campus and classroom is a great way to show commitment to the school; just make sure to mention the visit in your application.</p>
<p>The case study method still remains the major pedagogical tool through which the Darden learning model is taught. Professors select students through cold calls to initiate case analysis and then invite the entire class to participate in the dialogue. Students are placed in the role of the decision maker and must have the ability to articulate and defend their positions in an insightful manner. Your ability to contribute to case conversations will most likely be tested during your Darden interview. The interviewer will be evaluating your ability to provide cogent responses, your confidence level, and your professionalism. Your challenge is to position yourself as a candidate who can play both the student and the teacher roles within the case study framework. It should be noted, however, that while Darden is a case study school at heart, it has added other educational devices to its toolbox such as: video cases, articles, simulations, and experiential activities.</p>
<p>While the cases place you in the role of an individual decision-maker, case preparation is conducted in student learning teams. As a student, you would be placed in a learning team immediately after starting the Darden program. Teams are expected to meet every night, so discussing your ability to interact well with others should be an important piece of your application.</p>
<p>Darden expects its graduates to be leaders in their fields, but it also understands that leadership is learned through a path of progression. Make sure your essays show a progression in leadership and your recommendations highlight your potential to continue growing as a leader. </p>
<p>Darden is also well known for its strong emphasis on ethics. All students are required to take a course on the subject and ethical challenges often arise in cases through out the rest of the curriculum. The Olsson Center for Applied Ethics supports Darden's continued examination of the ethical aspects of business. Don't be surprised if a question on ethics comes up during your interview. </p>
<p>Darden is one of the few schools that doesn't impose word limits on its essays. This is nice because of the added flexibility. However, that added flexibility can also lead some applicants to go overboard, writing essays that quickly lose their focus and clarity. It is therefore extra important for you to ensure that your essays answer the stated questions and do so in a powerful and thoughtful manner. Make sure that your essays are segmented using headers and that any background information provided is only given to support your position. Even though the essays have no limit, admissions members certainly have limited patience.</p>
<p>While some modifications have been made to the Darden learning model to curb excessive work, the academic experience remains intense. Although students don’t take exams on Saturdays, as in the past, the Darden experience is anything but a two year vacation. Perhaps for no other school is the analogy to drinking from firehose more appropriate. There are no days off at Darden, as students spend more time in the classroom than at any other top business school and conquer 13 cases a week on average. Students are expected to enter the program with a background in statistics, economics, and accounting. The benefit from such a rigorous learning model is that graduates truly feel that they’ve received value in return for their efforts. The intensity pays off in preparation. Focus on this benefit and your ability to succeed within the parameters of the learning model, and you will be on your way to establishing a good fit with the Darden tradition.</p>

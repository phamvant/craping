<h1 class="aTitle">Kelley - Briefing of Top Business Schools - 15</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>Curriculum innovation is one of the strongest assets of the Kelley learning model. The curriculum continues to receive accolades for its integrated, cross-functional approach to teaching. The basis of the approach is that ral-world business challenges are not discretely segmented into functions and therefore business school should be taught in an integrated manner. The admissions committee is looking for applicants wit leadership potential who view business issues in a cross-functional way and are interested in participating in a learning model that is taught in an equally integrated and flexible fashion. </p>
<p>The initial 24 weeks of the first year are split into three sections: Grasping the Foundations of Management and Decision-making, Identifying New Business Opportunities, and Managing an Ongoing Enterprise Profitably. These sections consist of a total of 14 modules, each module building upon the lessons of the previous modules. The goal of the core curriculum is to provide students with tools and intuition that will be invaluable in making management decisions. As a checkpoint, mid-way through the core, students participate in a team-based case competition, which allows them to display the benefits of integrated learning. One way for you to display an appreciation for the Kelley approach is to discuss how the results of actions you've taken in a business environment have been beneficial to multiple functions and not just the one to which you belong.</p>
<p>Outside of the core curriculum, students select majors and minors from a suite of 11 options including: E-Business, Finance, Information Systems, Marketing, Production/Operations Management, and Strategic Management Consulting. If none of the options suits their needs, students can design their own major that fits with their career interests. To supplement their specialized study, students can apply to participate in an "Academy." Academies are industry-focused and allow students to take part in career-focused course work and professional development activities such as discussions with professionals in the industry, a speaker series, and trips to relevant companies. There are Academies for Consumer Marketing, Entrepreneurship, Global Experience, Health Care, Investment Banking, Investment Management, Sports and Entertainment, and Management Consulting. Discussing these learning opportunities and how they would benefit you in achieving your career goals is a great way to establish fit with Kelley. </p>
<p>Looking into the future, Kelley will continue to focus attention on technology, leadership, and global initiatives. Technology is viewed as a powerful enabler of many of the strategies discussed in the classroom and Kelley strives to be recognized as a frontrunner in the usage of technology. Like most other top business schools, Kelley would like to be known as an institution that produces leaders and has established its Leadership Development Institute to help support that objective. From an international perspective, Kelley has gradually increased its international student percentage to 30 percent, and has added several study abroad opportunities. If you have the background or the direction to capitalize on any of these trends, make sure to spell them out in your application.</p>
<p>If the curriculum is the heart of the Kelley learning model, then the faculty is the life-blood. The faculty receives high praise for accessibility, commitment, and expertise. The strong commitment of the faculty has helped create a collegial environment in which teamwork is a strong norm. The admissions committee will be very interested to hear ways in which you can contribute to this environment. Loners and gunners need not apply.</p>
<p>While interviewing with Kelley is not required, it is encouraged. Nonetheless, only approximately 50 percent of applicants participate in the interview. The interview is an excellent opportunity for you to establish fit with the program as well as to display a true desire to attend the school. Your initiative will be duly noted by an admissions committee that is looking to increase its yield percentage.</p>

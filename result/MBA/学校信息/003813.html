<h1 class="aTitle">A feeling to the Ivey</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>Haven't been here for a long time. Now I am an Ivey MBA 2007 student and I am glad that I made the right choice. </p>
<p>The first thing I would like to share with you guys is that Ivey is still the best b-school in Canada. You can tell it from the recruiters. If you want to develop yourself in Consulting industry, Ivey is the only choice for you in Canada. All of the most respected consulting companies will go to Ivey to recruit someone every year, if you are strong enough, you will get the chance. As to the Investment bank, although U of T maybe the best B-school in Finance, 25 to 30 percent Ivey graduates find their jobs in IB each year. </p>
<p>The second thing I would like to mention is Ivey is not for everyone. Its General management focusing, Case study method and Class contribution have distinguished it from the traditional B-school which focus on lectures. You have to STRUGGLE in EVERY class to contribute yourself, to follow the comments given by profs and classmates, to challenge and be challenged by your peers. If you enjoy the traditional way where the prof give the solo speech in the class, Never choose Ivey because Ivey is not for you. </p>
<p>The third thing is about the One-year program. I have to admit that this change in strategy will influence Chinese students a lot because you may have no time to accommodate yourself in a new environment and a new country. Therefore, if you can't be here, I mean Canada, in advance, or if your Oral English is not good enough to allow yourself to express yourself relatively freely, think it again to choose Ivey. I learned a lot in Ivey during the first term, while some Chinese students don't share the same feelings as me. </p>
<p>If you can be admitted by Top 10, don't come here; If you can't handle the presure when arguing with your classmates and profs, don't come here; If you are not confident to express yourself relative clearly to support your points, don't come here. However,&nbsp; if you want to challenge yourself to see how far you can push yourself and what's your limits, Ivey is the only choice for you in Canada!</p>
<p>Personal opinion, Just for reference!</p>

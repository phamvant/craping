I really appreciate your time. Let me begin by asking: What sets INSEAD’s MBA programme apart from the rest?</i></b></p><blockquote><p><b>Andy:</b> The thing that makes the INSEAD MBA different is that it’s an accelerated one year programme that is delivered on our Europe (France) and Asia (Singapore) campuses. Our MBA students engage in quality learning across two different locations with peers comprising at least 90 nationalities and are given access to a myriad of global career opportunities. “Diversity” is the word that we use a lot. </p></blockquote><p><b><i>Karen: Do you mean to say students will encounter some cultural differences?</i></b></p><blockquote><p><b>Andy:</b> Yes, and it’s the same for me, managing the administrative aspects of the programme. From the outset, students are divided into several sections of 70, with each section further sub-divided into diverse working groups of five. Blended according to nationality, background and gender, students work together on projects, learn and understand the cultural differences that exist among them. Our MBAs become part of a collaborative culture that accelerates their professional development – just like working in the real business world.</p></blockquote><p><b><i>Karen:</i></b><i><b>So, international experience is critical to surviving in such an environment, right? What about local candidates who’ve only worked in China? How can they demonstrate their experience of working on an international level?</b></i></p><blockquote><p><b>Andy: </b>Given today’s modern world, even if you’ve never left China, you might have teammates stationed abroad, with whom you might communicate with via telephone, email or Skype. That counts as international exposure. In my last job at Microsoft in Shanghai, we had engineers located in China who served clients in all parts of the world. That again, is another example of what I’d call international exposure.</p></blockquote><p><b><i>Karen: Sure! I know you’ve had diverse work experience as an English teacher, a consultant, and a trainer. So, what motivated you to work for a business school? What do you find most interesting and frustrating about your job? </i></b></p><blockquote><p><b>Andy: </b>The core skill that I have used the most in all of these jobs is customer service. The only difference now is that I manage a group of high-level ‘customers’. My job with school administration is to help students through the process of our MBA, such as getting to classes, housing, relocating to France etc. We also provide support and facilities for partners and children on campus, and counselling services for people who are feeling stressed out. I am sensitive to the needs of our students and always make it a point to find out what’s going on with them. This is what really drives me: to make the lives of our students easier. The thing that frustrates me about my job is how short the one year is. It seems like just after orientation, we’re suddenly at graduation.</p></blockquote><p><b><i>Karen: You are currently coordinating student activities in both the France and Singapore campuses. Do you attend their club events? </i></b></p><blockquote><p><b>Andy: </b>With about 30 clubs in existence, of course! I attend some of the fun activities and drinks organised by the clubs. It’s a lot of fun, but it can also be exhausting.  </p></blockquote><p><b><i>Karen:</i></b><i><b>Given your in-depth experience engaging with MBA students, we’d like your views on the dynamic nature of INSEAD’s learning environment. Is there a personality type that might not be the best fit for the school?</b></i></p><blockquote><p><b>Andy:  </b>If you’re the kind of person who likes to keep quiet in class, to sit in the back row, or if you’re kind of shy, you won’t feel comfortable at INSEAD. Our curriculum is very open and interactive. If you’re asked: “Karen, what do you think about this?” You’ll have to respond. If you don’t like being challenged in public, you’ll be pushed to really come out of your comfort zone and strongly put your argument forward in the classroom.</p></blockquote><p><b><i>Karen:</i></b><i><b>I recognise that your students usually have significant work experience. Why do you value that so much? </b></i></p><blockquote><p><b>Andy:</b> It’s interesting that in our classroom, you’ll find that people from certain industries show up and react to the INSEAD environment in different ways. We do have students who at 24 or 25 years of age, hold their own and get on well with mature professionals. Simply put, the number of years you’ve spent working is not a big deal. It’s more about the personality in general, and how you fit in with the group.</p></blockquote><p><b><i>Karen: What do you think is the greatest difference between both campuses?</i></b></p><blockquote><p><b>Andy: </b>If you’re in the classroom, there’s no difference. Our faculty and curriculum are the same but in certain aspects, the difference is huge in terms of one’s physical surroundings, climate and language. Singapore is a modern Asian city, while Fontainebleau is a commune in the metropolitan area of Paris, about a 35-minute drive south of it. It’s beautiful. The other thing that Singapore doesn’t have is four distinct seasons, but if you prefer a tropical climate, then it is the place for you. Getting around in Fontainebleau isn’t quite as convenient as in Singapore, so you should have a car. You might also find it a bit challenging if you don’t speak French, but you’ll get by. </p></blockquote><p><b><i>Karen: Does it mean that students who want to stay in Fontainebleau need good knowledge of French?</i></b></p><blockquote><p><b>Andy:</b> It’s not mandatory. We’ve got a lot of support and you can definitely survive Fontainebleau with English alone. About 80% people choose to go on campus exchange to experience another culture. Those who plan to work in Asia tend to spend Period 5 in Singapore in search of jobs and setting up interviews. You also have the few who prefer one campus over the other, and who choose not to go on campus exchange. These are the people who are so settled they say, “I’m not leaving”. </p></blockquote><p><b><i>Karen: Are there any aspects of the programme that you’d like to highlight?</i></b></p><blockquote><p><b>Andy:</b> The most amazing thing that you’ll notice when you come to INSEAD is that we have an amazing faculty. Having them on board is great exposure for our community to the top thinkers of the world. Sometimes, I attend a class or have coffee with a faculty member. Although I’m not a student, I feel smarter from just being around faculty.</p></blockquote><p><b><i>Karen:</i></b><i><b>I think we are running out of time, any last words about the programme?</b></i></p><blockquote><p><b>Andy: </b>This is a two-year programme condensed into 10 months, so it’s very intense. For instance, other two-year programmes such as Wharton don’t hold classes on Fridays. I can’t imagine what that’d be like at INSEAD because we conduct classes even on the weekends. What I’ve advised students is to get enough sleep before classes and also to get some exercise because it’ll be mentally and physically challenging. We swear by the three “S”: Sleep, Study and Socialise. You’re supposed to pick two of them. </p></blockquote><p><i><b>Karen: I absolutely agree. Thank you so much for sharing this with us!</b></i></p><p>--------------------------------------</p><p>原文引自：<br><a href="https://forum.chasedream.com/thread-929559-1-1.html">https://forum.chasedream.com/thread-929559-1-1.html</a></p><p>参与讨论及查看更多的相关文章请访问【北美MBA申请区】<br><a href="https://forum.chasedream.com/forum-13-1.html">https://forum.chasedream.com/forum-13-1.html</a></p></div>

<h1 class="aTitle">Broad School - Briefing of Top Business Schools - 19</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>Over the last few years, Broad (rhymes with "road") has expanded its brand be yond "regional MBA" status. This expansion can be attributed to a quick rise in the bschool rankings and Broad's strength in practical specializations. Students can select from four primary specializations (Supply Chain Management, Marketing Technology, Human Resource Management, and Finance). The Supply Chain Management (SCM) specialization has especially helped place Broad on the map. SCM, which focuses on manufacturing operations, logistics, and purchasing, continues to draw recruiters from across the nation that are looking to optimize their product and information flows. Students may supplement these areas of focus with secondary specializations, which include: Business Information Systems, Corporate Accounting, General Management, and Leadership &amp; Change Management. Referencing your specialization interests and explaining how a background in those areas could support vour career goals should he key components of your application strategy. </p>
<p>Another large asset of the program is its career services function. Broad’s career services group has made extensive efforts to attract a bevy of innovative companies to campus. As a result, Broad students now enjoy an average rate of job offers that is commensurate to or greater than that of other top programs. Some of the major recruiters include: Intel, Gemini Ernst &amp; Young, IBM, Ford, and A.T. Kearney. You should take note that there is relatively little investment bank presence on campus. Along those lines, make sure that your career goals align well with Broad's strengths. </p>
<p>Broad students rave about the school's small size and the access to professors. They enjoy the intimate environment and the close relationships that are developed within the program. Unlike most other b-school programs, chances are that you will leave Broad knowing all of your classmates' names.</p>
<p>Over the last few years Broad has begun to make a name for itself through case competitions. Held around the globe, case competitions allow teams of three to six students to display their analytical, public speaking, and persuasion skills. Broad actively encourages students to participate in these competitions and assists in students preparation for them. The results speak for themselves, as Broad students have come away with high placements in a number of these competitions. If you have any interest in participating in case competitions, bring them up as a great discussion point.</p>
<p>Broad's application is fairly compact in comparison to the applications of other top programs. With two short essays, the Broad application makes it more difficult for candidates to differentiate themselves from each other. As such, it is important that your baseline statistics (GMAT and GPA) are close to those of the current MBA class. This importance has been compounded as Broad looks to improve its baseline statistics in order to continue its movement up the rankings. Therefore, you should utilize the optional essay to address weaknesses in baseline statistics that are five percent below the means.</p>
<p>Overall, Broad is looking for bright candidates who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty while working to solve managerial issues. If you can position yourself as such and hit the mark in terms of GMAT and GPA, your application will resonate positively with the admissions committee.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Broad grads received criticism for their lack of teamwork capabilities. The Broad administration was quick to react and has made strong efforts to introduce team building exercises into the learning model. Today, a large portion of class assignments are completed in teams. From the moment orientation begins, students are placed on project teams and students' skills are continuously enhanced through team building workshops and activities. As part of the core curriculum, students are required to take the course Leadership &amp; Teamwork. This course provides students with an experiential learning opportunity through which they can work in teams under different simulated conditions. The bottom line is that you should present yourself to the admissions committee as a team player who is open to further examination of your team skills.</p>

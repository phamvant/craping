<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>今天在berkeley参加了一个workshop，主题是choosing the right professional school，主持人是Eric Abrams, Diversity Directorfor Haas School Of Business, 就是Berkeley的商学院，我做了些笔记，心理斗争一下后，决定跟大家分享，可以看看美国人和美国的admissionoffice是怎么看问题的：</p>
<ol>
<li>Apply to academic schools? Make sure there are morethan one faculty in the area you want to study in. 
</li><li>Apply for professional schools (law, business,medical)? Make sure it fits. For example, the atmosphere in the class. Cooperative?Aggressive? What do you like? How is the school? 
</li><li>How to know if the school fits? 1.alumni orcurrent student; 2.visit 
</li><li>How does admission committee work? Seq: 1. Scan yourtranscription; 2. Scan GT; 3. Scan PS,CV 
</li><li>Transcription(not GPA) &gt; GT. Admission officecan find stories in your transcription but not GPA or GT. For example, you didn'tdo well in 2nd year? Oh, your parent divorce. I see. 
</li><li>Do you solve the problems other quit? Do youface challenge other avoid? Do you make a difference in your thing you care (thesame to MBA, do you make a difference in your workplace)? Write it down in PS,CV 
</li><li>The workplace or the company doesn’t matter. Thepoint is: do you make a difference? 
</li><li>Admission office only cares about 2 things: 1.Can you do the work/How do you contribute to the school? 2. Who are you/ Whythis school? 5,6,7 point to thing1; 9 – 12 point to thing2. 
</li><li>Have lunch with your recommenders. Tell themyour story. Ask them to write you a strong and relative recommendation letter. 
</li><li>The position of the recommender doesn't matter. Ifthe person knows you and tells how you are related to the program, it’s good. 
</li><li>Essay: how the school helps you? If your essaycan work for 2 schools, rewrite it. 
</li><li>Use things you like. Humor. Your personality. Whoare you? </li></ol>
<p>PS:</p>
<ol>
<li>No working experience, no MBA schools. If youdon’t have working experience, you don’t have enough reasons to apply for MBA.Think about what people do in MBA. 
</li><li>Send thank note after interview. 
</li><li>What Business Schools want:<br><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444752504578024630362755020.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444752504578024630362755020.html</a>

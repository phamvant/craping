<h1 class="aTitle">UT-Austin Mccombs MBA Q&amp;A</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>Hi everyone：</p>
<p>I am writing as representitive of Chinese students in the UT Austin Mccombs MBA students&nbsp;Class of 2011. This year we got 5 full-time students from mainland China and 2&nbsp;from Taiwai. Background&nbsp;includes consulting, marketing, project management and engineering. we will try to help you who are interested in our school and please feel free to post any questions here. </p>
<p>According to my experience so far, we have&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>relatively robust Texas Economy, an unemployment rate of ~8% vs ~9.6% US national wide.&nbsp;Especially for thoses who&nbsp;are interested in Energy or Hi-tech or entreprenuership, this is the perfect place to go. (for Ibanking, texas also holds a unique position for energy financing, for consulting we got&nbsp; great relasionship with Deloitte consulting&nbsp;and Mck, Bain, BCG, Booz also hire several students each year. Though both are extremely competitive for international students). </p>
<p>According to Forbs, the top 5&nbsp;best big city for jobs are amazingly all in Texas...</p>

<p>The city is amazing.&nbsp;Though as hot as Shanghai in summer(but less humid), winter could be cute.&nbsp;It is not a very big city like&nbsp;my hometown Shanghai, but there are a lot of interesting things here such as</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>millions of bats go out from the congress bridge&nbsp;at sunset. You could just imagine it...&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</li><li>BBQ in Salt Lick, which is famous in US for the wooden houses in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;lawn and forest&nbsp; 
</li><li>The very romantic and beautiful&nbsp;jetty beside Lake Austin 
</li><li>2 streets named 4th streets and 6th streets, in these two streets you can find nothing but pubs...if you like it...( The Bschool organizes 'THink and Drink' every Thursday night, and my finance professor told us that 'you should be very careful with it' coz it was where he met his wife years ago when he was an MBA here after a little bit alcohol, you know...) 
</li><li>people are very nice in Austin. Most of them are very friendly. Once i cannot find a place when I was on the street, and some guy just voluntarily helped me to make a phone call and find the way for me. It made me feel warm, as warm as the summer of texas... </li></ol>
<p></p>
</li><li>
<p>The school is also a great one. It enjoys the highest reputation in Texas. The Engineering, Business and law school are all ranked top20 and well-known through out the country.&nbsp; Besides, what impress me most is:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Sports. UT's football team ranked 2nd among the 120+ college football teams in US. People are crazy about it. We are enjoying the biggest college football stadium in US. The sports facility here is just fantastic. Current and former University of Texas at Austin athletes have won 88 Olympic medals, including 19 in Athens in 2004... 
</li><li>School environment. It is not a big campus, but it is a fine one. I could always find those squirrels chasing each other or&nbsp;holding pinecone and eating on the tree. Very cute. And the hispanic architecture style of the whole school is just the one i like most... 
</li><li>faculty: I am taking 4 courses for the 1st half of the semester including Finance, Economics, Statistics and Accounting </li></ol></li></ol>
<blockquote>
<p>For Finance, the guy got MBA and JD and played more than 1 billion hedge fund before. He is also directing the 11million MBA investment fund which is being run by 20 selected student&nbsp;fund managers who are interested in it each year.</p>
<p>For Economics, the professor Magee was White House Staff , and Co-Captain of&nbsp;U.S. National Soccer Champions...I guarantee you his class is going to be as funny as you could imagine...</p>
<p>For Statistics we got a math geek who originally taught in Chicago for 20 years. He is more an actor than a teacher which made the class experience more than funny...</p>
<p>For Accounting, we got the dean taught the course in this area and make our accounting ranked No.1 in US for many years in a row... for our 200+ bucks text book, he just made the publisher to waive their copyright for our free copy...very powerful.</p></blockquote>
<p>Back to the&nbsp;bloody world which is also real,&nbsp;very few is living an easy life. It is a hard time concerning job market for almost every&nbsp; B-School, and especially for international students. Please think twice before you quit your job for an MBA. However, if you would like a two year adventure in another country, to test and push out your edge both physically and mentally, for an extremely exicitng life, booming your future career(potentially), you should come here or any other prestigious top US programs. After all there is always hope for everyone. Just work harder and play even harder! Let's have fun and enjoy. Hope to see you guys next year!</p>

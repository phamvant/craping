<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>关于Kellogg MMM program很多人对Kellogg MMM program ( <a href="http://mmm.northwestern.edu/">http://mmm.northwestern.edu/</a> )感兴趣，我来提供一些基本的信息,&nbsp; 希望能帮助您做出最好的决定。</p>
<ol>
<li>MMM program is a 2 year full-time MBA-MEM dual degree program at Kellogg. You'll get 2 degrees upon graduation.<br><br>
</li><li>MMM curriculum is totally integrated into Kellogg regular MBA program, you will be required to take a few core courses(mostly on operations) to satisfy the degree requirement. Other than that, there is no difference than regular MBA program.<br><br>
</li><li>MMM student has "dual-citizenship" at Kellogg: they are both part of a regular MBA section and the MMM section("section" is like the "class" in a typical chinese university where you have 50~60 classmates and take some courses, have fun activities together). So in many cases, your regular section classmate don't even know that you are also a MMM after two years.<br><br>
</li><li>MMM students typically have engineering/marketing/consulting/finance background, and are generally interested in technology, operations, manufacturing.<br><br>
</li><li>Most MMM students go to consulting, general management, high tech marketing etc. after graduation. Every year there are also a few students choose investment banking/VC/PE careers. See attached for a 2005 employment report of MMM program.<br><br>
</li><li>About Chinese students in MMM:<br><br>There are Chinese students(from mainland, Taiwan, and US) in MMM program every year, the number varies from year to year though. class of 2005 had 4, class of 2006 has 1, and class of 2007 has 4.<br><br>Chinese MMM students follow similar career path as regular MMM class. Most of them went to consulting, general management, and banking.<br><br>
</li><li>About application:<br><br>MMM program follows the same application procedure as regular 2-yr MBA program, you can not apply both regular 2-yr MBA program and MMM program at the same time though. The student profiles and admission criteria are almost identical to those of the regular 2-year MBA class. Interview is also the same. You will probably be asked about why MMM, although that was not my case.<br><br>
</li><li>So why and why not MMM?</li></ol>
<p>MMM is good for people who wants to learn more on operations (more courses offered)</p>
<p>MMM is good for people who are interested in technology(certain&nbsp; technology/manufacturing companies prefer to recuit MMM students)</p>
<p>MMM is good for people looking for a tight community feel(unique mentoring/social programs, tight connection with MMM alumni), yet still connected to the outside world.</p>
<p>MMM is good for people looking to start their own companies after graduation. (Special help from MMM program, MMM-only-courses focusing on new product development, entrepreneurship)</p>
<p>MMM is probably not for people who wants total curriculum freedom. MMM is not for people who doesn't want to deal with manufacturing/operations. </p>

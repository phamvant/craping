<h1 class="aTitle">Michigan -  Briefing of Top Business Schools 5</h1>
<div id="content" class="vditor-reset" style="width: 580px; padding: 0px 10px; overflow-x: hidden; word-break: break-all;"><p>Recently&nbsp;I am reading "Your MBA Game Plan". It is quite well written, and it provides a lot of information. There is one section in the book that introduces the differences among all the top schools. I try to transfer some of the information to CD so you all can take a look at. Credits are given to the authors of the book: Omari Bouknight &amp; Scott Shrum. Please do not use the following excerpt for any business purposes. And Mr. Zeros please erase this message if copyright is concerned.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to scan the book. So I have to type the entire passage from scratch. It is impossible for me to finish all 30 schools in a short period of time since I myself am in the application process too. So I will do one school each time. Response which schools you want to read first. I will work on the school that gets the most responses. Certainly if someone here has the same book and would like to share the excerpts, you are more than welcome to add the schools.</p>
<p>Please pardon my typos. I type it, not just copy and paste.</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The key to getting accepted into the University of Michigan Business School (UMBS) is to demonstrate balance across the four dimensions (leadership, innovation, teamwork, maturity) throughout your application. Regardless of the application component(s) in which you emphasize these dimensions, they should each make a couple appearances. It is imperative, therefore, that you take time to analyze your strengths and weaknesses for each of the dimensions before beginning the UMBS application. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">UMBS is consistently recognized for its innovation and its focus on applying business principles to real-world scenarios. Both of these attributes are integrated in the learning model along with a solid dose of general management courses. A good example of this combination is UMBS’s Multidisciplinary Action Project. Students are required to work on teams in completing a seven-week project for companies pre-selected by UMBS. The projects are highly analytical and allow students to apply the skills they learned in the classroom to a variety of companies. For those who have inclinations that are more international or entrepreneurial in nature, UMBS offers its IMAP and EMAP programs. The latest example of UMBS’s application-based learning is the Tozzi Center. The Tozzi Electronic Business and Finance Center features a trading floor, an elliptical classroom, and a computer laboratory. The trading floor allows for dedicated, real-time access to the global markets. It is used for a multitude of financial class exercises and student projects. Having and displaying knowledge of these types of programs should be a major component of your UMBS application process. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Demonstrating the ability to apply business principles in a rational manner is especially important. Recruiters repeatedly complement UMBS grads on their practical approach, which has been a large reason for UMBS's success in the business school rankings. One applicant, who was recently accepted, displayed a practical approach by explaining how she identified a neglected growth opportunity within her business segment. The applicant took initiative by creating a marketing plan that focused on the opportunity and was able to see her idea through to implementation. These are the types of applicants UMBS seeks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Given UMBS's focus on professional excellence, it is not surprising to see that accepted students have an average of five years of work experience. This should not discourage applicants with less professional work experience, but recognize that UMBS will especially want to know how you can contribute to the program if you have less than three years of work experience. You should anticipate being questioned on this point during your interview.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Almost all activities at UMBS are team based, so check your ego before beginning the application. Providing one or two examples of your teamwork capabilities should go a long way toward establishing fit with the program.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Overall, if you meet the baseline criteria, express the four dimensions, display knowledge about the learning model and exhibit passion for the school, you should be in a much better position to receive an acceptance letter from UMBS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Over time, entrepreneurship has received greater attention at UMBS and it is now a major aspect of the learning model. The school has vast resources for aspiring entrepreneurs, such as the Samuel ZeIl-Robert H. Lurie Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies, which supports students as they explore their own business plans and start-up ideas. UMBS will continue to expand its support of entrepreneurial activities because it produces a virtuous cycle. Successful ventures led by students reflect positively on the curriculum, thereby attracting more potential students. The UMBS application process allows for ample opportunity to discuss innovative entrepreneurial ideas and those opportunities should be capitalized on. That is not to say that all applicants should be aspiring entrepreneurs, but to the extent that you can display entrepreneurial spirit, do so. That spirit can be expressed through an idea for a new business or through an idea for your current company. The admissions committee will certainly take notice of your penchant for entrepreneurship and hopefully recognize your ability to augment to the UMBS brand. Being recognized as a potential brand builder is a great way to move your application into the "yes" &nbsp;pile.</font></p>

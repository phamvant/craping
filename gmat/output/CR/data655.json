Nothing's less fun then taking notes...but let's do it anyway:\n\nConclusion: Major cause of decline in LC was decline in lead gas [It's pretty common to find the conclusion in the question stem...so always be on the lookout]\n\nPremises: Decline between 75 and 85. Feds said industrial discharge down in 1975. 75% drop in lead gasoline between 75 and 85.\n\nAssumption: Industrial discharge didn't do it. [Basically, we're looking for something to downplay the importance of the legislation.]\n\n(A) The level of lead contamination in United States rivers fell sharply in both 1975 and 1983.\nPROBLEM: This would possibly weaken. We wouldn't want to see sharp declines, because it sounds like the drop was gradual (as lead gas was phased out).\n\n(B) Most of the decline in industrial discharges of lead occurred before 1976, but the largest decline in the level of river contamination occurred between 1980 and 1985.\nANSWER: Well, if the industrial decline occurred before 1976, that means that the effect of the legislation was almost immediate. But if the contamination dropped mostly between 80 and 85, that could only be because of the rise of unleaded gas.\n\n(C) Levels of lead contamination in rivers fell sharply in 1975-1976 and rose very slightly over the next nine years.\nPROBLEM: This weakens a lot. This sounds like the legislation had a big effect, and then nothing happened for the rest of the time. We wanted gas to slowly make things better, but they're actually getting worse!\n\n(D) Levels of lead contamination rose in those rivers where there was reduced river flow due to drought.\nPROBLEM: This doesn't connect to either industry or gas, so it's irrelevant.\n\n(E) Although the use of leaded gasoline declined 75 percent between 1975 and 1985, 80 percent of the decline took place in 1985.\nPROBLEM: Alright. Here's the toughie. The problem is that this doesn't actually add any information that we didn't have in the passage itself. Looks like it does, doesn't it? But think about it. We already knew the use of leaded gasoline declined 75 percent between 75 and 85 (that part is LITERALLY in the passage word for word). Then we're just told that most of it happened at the end. So what? That doesn't tell us anything about the contamination itself. What we really wanted was to WEAKEN the influence of the legislation, which B does.\n\nHope that helps!\n\n-t",

        "explanation": "Explanation\n\nBacteria and archaea, collectively known as prokaryotes, are present on every continent and make up around half of global biomass -- the total weight of all organisms on Earth. \n\nMost prokaryotes perform respiration that uses energy and releases carbon dioxide, contributing to climate warming. \n: Carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere adds to climate warming.\nTherefore, as global temperatures rise, prokaryotes could increase climate warming at a faster rate than current models suggest.\n: With temperatures rising globally, climate warming could also increase at a faster speed than that indicated by current models. And prokaryotes would be responsible for this increase at a faster speed.\n\n - . prokaryotes could increase climate warming at a faster rate than currently believed. Why? The conclusion contains information about “rising global temperatures”.  Thus, the “rising temperatures” and “faster rate of increase in climate warming” are definitely correlated. And if the “prokaryotes” are somehow responsible for upping the climate warming rate, then, the prokaryotes and the “rising temperatures” must also be correlated.\n \n\n\n\n“Inversely proportional” means if one entity increases by a certain amount, then the other entity decreases by that same amount. So, if the temperature increases then the carbon output decreases. That should lead to less addition to climate warming and that cannot certainly lead to a faster rate of climate warming. This choice actually casts a doubt on the conclusion. \nIncorrect Choice.\n\n\nThe prokaryotes make up half the biomass weight. Thus, the carbon dioxide realesed would be according to that at any given point. This does not explain why the climate warming rate would be faster.

Thus, the impact of this choice will be ambiguous. Too small a number then, the choice does not make us believe more in the conclusion. Only a high number would do that. Because of the ambiguous impact, this choice has to be ruled out.\nIncorrect Choice.\n\n\nIf the temperature increases then the respiration rate decreases. Ideally, although we do not know, a decrease in respiration rate should lead to a decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide released. That should lead to less addition to climate warming and that cannot certainly lead to a faster rate of climate warming.

        "question": "Motor-scooter dealers attribute a drastic decline in sales over the last few years to a new law requiring motor-scooter riders to wear helmets. Previously, helmets had been obligatory for motorcycle riders but not for motor-scooter riders-a difference that the dealers argue made scooters preferable for many customers. Safety advocates, however, dispute the dealers' explanation, pointing out that the law's introduction coincided with a large increase in the cost of mandatory insurance for both types of vehicle.\n\nIn evaluating the safety advocates' and the dealers' explanations, it would be most helpful to know which of the following?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Information that helps with evaluating an explanation will support or cast doubt on that explanation. So, we're looking for the choice that names information that would support or cast doubt on the explanations, and since we have two different explanations, the information will probably support one while casting doubt on the other.\n\n\n\nKnowing this would not help with evaluating the argument.\n\nAfter all, regardless of whether there were \"any\" motor-scooter riders who regularly wore helmets before the law required them to do so, the law could still have affected most motor-scooter riders, who went from not having to wear helmets if they rode motor-scooters to having to wear helmets.\n\nIn other words, \"any motor-scooter riders\" could be a tiny percentage of motor-scooter riders, in which case, the helmet law would still have made a difference to the vast majority of motor-scooter riders.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nNotice that this choice mentions \"the same rate.\" \"The same rate\" is just one specific thing, a rate that is the same.\n\nHaving information on whether the cost increased at \"the same rate\" wouldn't help.\n\nAfter all, if the cost of insurance for other motor vehicles has increased at the same rate as that for motor scooters and motorcycles, then it still could be the case that people became less inclined to buy motor scooters because of either the helmet law or the increase in the insurance rate. Maybe people just didn't feel like spending the money, or maybe they didn't want to wear helmets.\n\nAlternatively, if the cost of insurance for other motor vehicles has not increased at the same rate, we have no idea about what happened with that cost. Did it increase? Decrease? Remain the same? We don't know.\n\nSo, this information either makes no difference or has unclear implications.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nKnowing this would not help with evaluating the argument. Here's why.\n\nPresumably, the accident rates for motor scooters and motorcycles would have remained about the same over time, or at least haven't suddenly changed \"drastically.\" So, how the two rates compare has likely remained about the same over time as well.\n\nSomething that remains about the same would not explain or cause a new change such as a \"drastic decline.\" In fact, it's useful for CR to keep in mind that, in general, something that remains the same will not be the cause of a new change.\n\nSo, knowing how the accident rate for motor scooters compares to the accident rate for motorcycles would not help in evaluating the argument since that comparison would not be an alternative cause for the \"drastic decline in sales over the last few years.\"\n\nThus, regardless of how the two accident rates compare, that information would not be reason to believe or not believe the safety advocates' and the dealers' explanations.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nRegardless of how sales of imported motor scooters have changed compared with sales of domestically produced models, it's still the case that, after the helmet law came into existence and insurance rates increased, overall sales of motor scooters declined. So, having the information mentioned by this choice would not really change what we know about the scenario.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nHaving this information would help us to evaluate the argument. Here's how.\n\nMotorcycles that are close in purchase price to motor scooters are products similar to motor scooters.\n\nAlso, we know from the passage that insurance rates have increased for both motor cycles and motor scooters.\n\nOn the other hand, the helmet law change applies to motor scooters only.\n\nLet's consider some ways sales of motorcycles that are close in purchase price to motor scooters could have changed.\n\nIncreased - In this case, sales of motor scooters have declined while sales of similarly priced motorcycles have increased. That information would tend to confirm that the helmet law made the difference since the increase in insurance rates didn't cause the sales of motorcycles to decline.\n\nRemained the same - In this case, we have a situation similar to the one in which sales of motorcycles increased. Sales of motor scooters have declined while sales of similarly priced motorcycles have remained the same. That information would tend to confirm that the helmet law made the difference since the increase in insurance rates didn't cause the sales of motorcycles to decline.\n\nDecreased - In this case, sales of motorcycles have declined just as sales of scooters have. That information would support the conclusion that the increase in insurance cost caused the decline in motor-scooter sales since both motor-scooter sales and also motorcycle sales declined at the same time, the change in insurance costs affected them both, and the helmet law affected only motor scooters.\n\nWe can see that having this information helps us to determine which explanation is correct.\n\nThe correct answer is (E).",

        "explanation": "in prizes such as Courses, Tests, Private Tutoring, \n        \n        \n    \n\n­\n\n\n\nThe argument claims that the reminder system in the app is what drives the weight loss - not other aspect of the app. This choice highlights that the reminder system is the primary factor driving user weight loss by questioning if this feature specifically (versus other app features or external factors) is the most influential in changing eating habits. \n\n\n\nTrap answer. Knowing this information would help us to know only 1 external factor but there could be more than 1. What if app users engage in other physical activity or what if they don't but they instead do fasting or what if they eat smaller meals or take medication? This choice does not isolate those options and so we still would struggle to determine whether it is the app itself, reminder system, OR external aspects which resulted in weight loss. As the result, we cannot evaluate the effectiveness of the app's reminder system itself and thus this choice would not help us in evaluating the developer’s argument that reminders are the key feature. Eliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice compares the app to others but does not specifically address whether the reminder system within this particular app is the key to its success.This could help evaluate the app’s performance vs. other apps, but what if other apps also have similar reminder system? We don’t know anything about other apps and how they compare. We do not know that the reminder system is exclusive or unique to this app. Eliminate.\n\n\n\nThis answer choice might indicate the app’s overall effectiveness but doesn’t focus on the reminder system’s impact compared to other app features or external interventions. For example, app users may have used another weight-loss method, and indeed have seen results after using the app, but we would not know if the reminders features of the app were responsible for the weight loss, only that the app made a difference, and that’s not specific enough. Eliminate.\n\n\n\nThis answer choice does not focus on evaluating the specific claim about the reminder system’s role during the initial period, only long-term benefits which are not relevant for the argument.

        "question": "A study of more than 5,000 people showed that those who lived at high latitudes, where UV exposure is minimal, had higher cancer rates than did those who lived near the equator, where UV exposure is, on average, far greater. One of the effects of UV radiation on humans is that it stimulates vitamin D manufacture in exposed skin. These results are consistent with other studies demonstrating that cancer patients often have lower than average vitamin D levels. Therefore, high blood levels of vitamin D reduce the risk of cancer in humans.\n\nThe answer to which of the following questions would be most useful to know in order to evaluate the validity of the argument’s conclusion?\n\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A\n\n\n\nThe word “evaluate” indicates that this is an Evaluation question. The correct answer will contain a question relevant to the strength of the conclusion. Like Assumption, Strengthen, Weaken, and Flaw questions, Evaluation questions are built around assumptions in the stimuli.\n\n\n\nBegin by identifying the conclusion, evidence, and assumption(s). The conclusion is signaled by the word “Therefore”: high vitamin D levels reduce human cancer risk. The evidence comes in two main parts. First, the sun stimulates vitamin D production. People who live near the equator, where it’s sunny, have lower cancer rates than do people who live in high latitudes and get less sun. Second, people suffering from cancer have unusually low vitamin D levels. The author makes several assumptions here. One is that people living at higher latitudes have lower blood vitamin D levels. We know that people at high latitudes get less sun—but it’s possible that their UV-related vitamin D deficit is offset by some other factor. The next assumption is that differing vitamin D levels, if in fact they do differ between people at high and low latitudes, contribute to the differing cancer rates in these populations. Third, the author assumes that the low vitamin D\nlevels observed in cancer patients are not an effect of the cancer or of treatment for the cancer. Finally, the author assumes that there are no other differences between people in high latitudes and people in low latitudes that could affect their cancer risk.\n\n\n\nWhenever an argument includes a causal conclusion (X caused Y), consider two possibilities: an alternative cause (Z caused Y) or a reversal of causality (Y caused X). In this case, both possibilities could be relevant. To assess the strength of the argument, we would want to know, first, whether some factor unrelated to vitamin D could account for the difference in cancer rates between people at high and low latitudes (that’s an alternative cause). Second, we would want to know whether the low levels of vitamin D observed in cancer sufferers were a cause of the cancer, as opposed to an effect of the cancer (that’s a reversal of causality). An answer choice that addresses either of these two issues is correct.\n\n\n\n(A) matches our prediction and is the correct answer. If seasonal affective disorder does predispose humans to cancer, the conclusion that a low vitamin D level is responsible is greatly weakened. On the other hand, if seasonal affective disorder has no impact on cancer rates, then an alternative cause is ruled out, and the conclusion that vitamin D controls cancer risk is strengthened. (B) is outside the scope of the argument, which concerns cancer risk, not the risk of contracting a common cold. The method of raising vitamin D levels mentioned in (C) is likewise outside the scope, as are the “other mammals” mentioned in (D) and the “flu season phenomenon” mentioned in (E). .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

Brown shells seem to be more frequent when the underlying seafloor is dark-colored and white shells more frequent when the underlying seafloor is light-colored. A new theory has been advanced, however, that claims that shell color is related to physiological stress associated with heat absorption. According to this theory, brown shells will be more prevalent in areas where the wave action of the sea is great and thus heat absorption from the Sun is minimized, whereas white shells will be more numerous in calmer waters where the snails will absorb more heat from the Sun’s rays. \n\n\n",

The old theory predicts that if there are predators in an area then the shells should have the same color as the seafloor. The new theory, based on heat absorption, predicts that 1) brown shells will be more prevalent in rough waters, and 2) white shells will be more numerous in calm waters. Now we work through the answer-choices, looking for one that contradicts our summary of the old theory and supports our summary of the new theory. \n\nChoice (A) has predators, a dark seafloor, and, as the old theory predicts, dark-shelled snails. It thus supports the old theory. Additionally, it has dark shells in calm waters which contradicts the new theory. Eliminate (A). \n\nNext, choice (B) contradicts 2) of the new theory. Eliminate (B). \n\nNext, choice (C) contradicts 1) of the new theory. Eliminate (C). \n\nNext, choice (D) satisfies 2) of the new theory—light-shelled snails in calm waters. It also directly contradicts the old theory, which predicts that with many predators and a dark bottom the shells should be dark. So the answer is probably (D), but it’s prudent to check the last choice since we are looking for the best answer. \n\nChoice (E) satisfies 2) of the new theory, but it also satisfies the old theory, which predicts that with many predators and a light bottom the shells should be light.

        "question": "Although many people would not believe it, the mosquito is actually the most dangerous animal in Africa. While the bite of the black mamba is invariably lethal when untreated, this dreaded snake kills only a few dozen people per year. Hippopotami, with their immense strength and foul dispositions, kill hundreds of people per year in rivers and lakes, but the mosquito is still more dangerous. Mosquitoes bite hundreds of millions of people in Africa every year, and they infect over a million each year with malaria, a disease that is often fatal.\n\nWhich of the following questions would be most useful in evaluating the claim made above regarding the mosquito?\n",

        "question": "The owners of Hole-In-One Donuts, a combination mini golf course and donut shop in the town of Sealett, recently decided to take a controversial political stand online. As a result, a number of people opposed to this political view have promised to boycott Hole-In-One until its owners issue an apology.\n\nThe answer to which of the following questions would be the LEAST useful in determining whether the ensuing controversy will be detrimental to Hole-In-One’s profits? \n\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "“Whether Hole-In-One’s owners considered the potential financial impacts of taking a controversial political stand before sharing their position online” is interesting, but it does not clearly bear on the potential financial impacts experienced by Hole-In-One Donuts. \n\nPerhaps the owners considered these impacts but decided that they would be minor – the answer to “whether the ensuing controversy will be detrimental to Hole-In-One’s profits” might be “yes.” Or perhaps the owners considered, decided that the impacts would be majorly detrimental, but ultimately decided that the principle was more important than the money. Or perhaps the owners considered, decided that the impacts would be negligible, but were simply wrong. There is no reason to assume that the owners are infallible authorities when it comes to the impact that a political controversy might have on their company’s bottom line. \n\nThen again, perhaps the owners considered, expected no negative impacts, and were correct – producing a “no” answer to the underlying question.\n\nOr perhaps the owners didn’t consider the impacts at all, but again we know nothing about “whether the ensuing controversy will be detrimental to Hole-In-One’s profits.” The answer could still, just as easily, be “yes” or “no.” \n\nIt’s simply not possible to take B are solid evidence in any direction.\n\nAnswer A is relevant in a very direct way. If Hole-In-One’s customers share the boycotters’ views, then these customers may be more apt to join the boycott and thereby reduce Hole-In-One’s profits. If the customers do not share these views, and if, to our knowledge, only “people opposed to this political view” are going to boycott, then there is no clear reason to expect that these customers would join in and no reason to think that a boycott by people who presumably were not patrons of Hole-In-One to begin with would reduce Hole-In-One’s profits.\n\nAnswer C suggests a different way in which the boycott may or may not harm Hole-In-One’s profits. If enough new customers will be drawn to Hole-In-One in response to the political stand, then the net impact of the “ensuing controversy” should not be negative. Otherwise, we may expect that the controversy will indeed negatively impact Hole-In-One’s profits.\n\nAnswer D is circumstantial but still useful. If “comparable businesses in Sealett… have taken similar stands,” then their resulting experiences have some relevance to what we may expect will happen to Hole-In-One. If those other businesses lost revenue, then this suggests that boycotts may have been effective and/or that these views may be unpopular enough in Sealett to cause customers to go elsewhere (without bringing in sufficient new customers to compensate). If, instead, other businesses have not suffered adverse impacts on revenue, then it seems likelier that Hole-In-One will not suffer revenue – and thus profit – losses either.\n\nAnswer E offers another mechanism by which Hole-In-One may avoid adverse consequences. Even if the boycott has a negative impact on revenue, the question ultimately asks about “Hole-In-One’s profits.” If Hole-In-One reaps costs savings through reduced advertising expenditures in light of the free publicity, and if those cost savings outweigh any reductions in revenue, then Hole-In-One should not expect to suffer reduced profits. However, if the controversy does not enable Hole-In-One to cut costs by enough to counteract lost revenues, then we may expect that the controversy will cause Hole-In-One’s profits will decline.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

So why would the clinic again think on that perspective to whether buy the machine or not as in some of the case it can be identified by visual inspection.....But in how many cases ????\nIt already says that the machine diagnoses skin cancer as reliably as the tissue test (which is mentioned as much accurate compared to visual inspection)\n\nThe intent of the clinic is to buy machine because it is more reliable than visual inspection....so why would it again think on getting diagnosis via visual inspection. \n\n\nJust reading the question without looking at option, the before thought should be  : The clinic should take the cost and the return on investment on the machine before buying it. \nFor the ROI, it has to analyze the usage on how many people will come for this test in clinic. It may happen that in hospital because of heavy use they are able to afford it and is justified. \n\nIn case of clinic, if the clinic is not getting those many patients of skin cancer who want this test, then the decision of buying the machine which could be costly may not be fruitful. \n\nHence C \n\nLet me know if I have helped....or made you more confused <img src=\"https://cdn.gmatclub.com/cdn/files/forum/images/smilies/1f603.png\" class=\"forumSmileyItem\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\":-)\">",

        "question": "Journalists sometimes use historical photographs to illustrate articles about current events. But this recycling of old photographs overstates the similarities between past and present, and thereby denies the individual significance of those current events. Hence, the use of historical photographs in this manner by journalists distorts public understanding of the present by presenting current events as mere repetitions of historical incidents.\n\nWhich one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly inferred?\n\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "You would have to be one lazy-ass journalist to actually do this. Let’s see: It’s Election Day, so you want to put some pictures in the newspaper, but instead of going outside and taking new pictures of voters you just pull out the stock photo of some dude wearing a “Kerry-Edwards ’04” t-shirt and slap that on the front page? You’ve gotta be kidding me.\n\nAnyway, the conclusion of the argument says, “The use of historical photographs in this manner… distorts public understanding.” We are asked to find an answer choice that “enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly inferred.” In other words, we are asked to  the conclusion of the argument. To do so, we are allowed to choose one answer choice, A through E, to use as an additional premise.\n\nUsually, we can predict the answer on this type of question very closely. Since the premises all have to be accepted as fact, all we have to do is connect, directly, any one of the premises with the conclusion. We can do this with a smallish bridge: “Overstating the similarities between past and present distorts public understanding,” or, “Denying the individual significance of current events distorts public understanding”.\n\nI could also do it with a much bigger bridge, something like, “Any use of photographs distorts public understanding,” or even, “Everything anyone ever does distorts public understanding.” The correct answer probably isn’t going to be that absurdly big, but it could be and still be the correct answer. We’re not being asked to identify an assumption that the speaker actually made; we’re being asked to act as attorney for the speaker, and identify an additional fact that, if true, would prove the speaker’s conclusion true.\n\nWhether the bridge is big or small, it will get us to the desired conclusion. Let’s see.\n\nA) There’s nothing about “distortion” here, so this can’t be the answer. At least one end of my bridge has to be the conclusion of the argument.\n\nB) Okay, this one matches our first prediction, above. This will turn out to be our answer.\n\nC) How can we prove distortion with a premise that starts out “ a practice distorts”? That would be assuming our conclusion (circular reasoning). This is out.\n\nD) Nothing here about distortion. No way.\n\nE) This one is irrelevant because there is no premise that talks about journalist’s beliefs. One end of the bridge here is properly grounded in the conclusion, but the other end of the bridge is floating in the ocean.\n\nOur answer is B, because it’s the only bridge from the premises to the desired conclusion.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",

Probably not! So we want to negate it. Should we say \"If you play the lottery, you will NOT win millions of dollars\"? Wait, that doesn't seem right. People do win the lottery; it's just not a very common outcome. If we say \"It's not true that if you play the lottery, you will win millions of dollars,\" what we mean is \"It is possible to play the lottery and NOT win millions of dollars.\" The proposed sufficient condition (playing the lottery) can happen without the proposed necessary condition (winning millions). \n\nNegated Conditional: If you play the lottery, you MAY NOT win millions of dollars.\n\nNow what about a conditional that you think is wrong in ALL cases?\n\nCrazy Conditional: If you are in China, you are in Africa.\n\nWHAT?!? This is clearly false and we want to negate it, but it seems funny to say \"If you are in China, you MAY NOT be in Africa,\" right? It feels better to say \"If you are in China, you ARE NOT in Africa.\" Of course, that is true. However, the previous version (MAY NOT) is true, too. If you ARE NOT in Africa, then you MAY NOT be there. It's this weaker version that we can commit to every time that we negate a conditional. The stronger version may be true, too, but that's always the case with negations. Consider the negation of \"I love today's popular music.\" The negation is \"I do not love today's popular music.\" It may be the case that I *hate* this music, but that's additional information that's not required for a negation.\n\nSo, long story short:\n\nNOT (X --&gt; Y) = X --&gt; MAYBE NOT Y\nor \nNOT (X --&gt; Y) = X is possible without Y\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n |  |",

They did, but at only slightly lower prices than the now-high prices of foreign firms. The lesson has been simple: trade protection means that United States manufactures gain while United States consumers lose.\n\nWhich one of the following is an assumption on which the author’s argument relies?\n\n\n(A) It is unreasonable to expect that government-imposed quotas and excise taxes will reduce prices for United States consumers.\nFirst off, is this even an ASSUMPTION by definition? Second, clearly this doesn’t seem to relate to the thrust of the author’s argument, which is based off a domino-effect analogy of what happens if trade protection occurs. Yellow flag.\n\n(B) United States manufacturers of computer chips are more concerned with high profits that are foreign manufacturers.\nThis is the true yet irrelevant choice. This doesn’t relate to the author’s argument. We need an assumption upon which the argument relies. Why is trade protection bad policy? Because US manufactures are more concerned with high profits? Yellow flag.\n\n(C) The United States government’s primary purpose in trade protection is to restore markets and profits to United States manufacturers.\nThis one was a little tempting. It ‘felt’ like a right answer choice. But it isn’t, since the third line of the passage is meant as an illustration for why trade protection is bad — not a reason for enacting trade protection policy itself. I’m seeing this on a later read, but when I initially went through the answer choices this was my top yellow flag, I think. I didn't go so deep into WHY it may be wrong.\n\n(D) With respect to trade protection, the microcomputer industry is representative of United States industry in general.\nYes, this feels good. The argument uses an illustration to convey its merit. The argument uses the microcomputer industry for this illustration. If I tried to convince you that all birds can fly using the example of a crow, the assumption is that, at the very least, crows represent all birds in that respect. Is that an Ostrich?! For the argument to work the microcomputer has to represent industries as a whole.\n\n(E) The quality of the chips produced by United States manufacturers is better than the quality of the chips produced by foreign manufacturers.\nIrrelevant. Let’s just leave it at that. I daresay this might be the answer choice for those who begin to create stories for it to work.\n\nGmatKnight dot com - Tutoring and free quick tips\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t -  -  -   - quick tip: there's a free auto-booking feature on the gmatknight site for a 15-min consult :)",

        "question": "­Since the early 1990s, many airliners have been equipped with telephones for passenger use. However, the telephones are expensive for passengers to use and their use has declined, especially since cell phones have become more prevalent. Nevertheless, since airlines collect a portion of the charge for each call made without having to pay anything for the telephone equipment, which is owned and maintained by telephone companies, airlines clearly still benefit financially from the telephones.\n\nIn drawing its conclusion, the argument depends on assuming which of the following?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of the argument is the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for the conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nWe see that the reasoning of the argument is basically that, since airlines generate revenue without having to pay for the telephone equipment used to generate the revenue, airlines benefit financially, meaning, basically., make a profit, by having the phones on their planes.\n\n\n\nThe correct answer will state an assumption necessary for the evidence to support the conclusion.\n\n\n\nTo eliminate this choice, we need to notice that, even if the proportion of the charge for an in-flight telephone call that goes to the airline HAS declined since the early 1990s, airlines still collect a portion of the charge for each call made.\n\nSo, regardless of whether the proportion of the charge that goes to the airlines has declined, it still makes sense to conclude that airlines benefit financially from having the phones. After all, since the airlines don't pay anything for the telephone equipment, even if they don't get much revenue from the telephones, as long as they get some revenue, having the phones could benefit them financially.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that airlines benefit financially from the telephones.\n\nThis choice does not have to be true for that conclusion to follow from evidence. After all, even if the telephones do NOT remain profitable for telephone companies, they could still be a source of financial benefits for airlines.\n\nNow, it's true that, if the telephones are not profitable for telephone companies, telephone companies may not continue to maintain phones in planes.\n\nAll the same, given that, as the passage indicates, the phones are currently in planes, they could be profitable for the airlines even if they are not for telephone companies.\n\nSo, the argument works even if this choice is not true.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is interesting.\n\nAfter all, the conclusion is \"airlines clearly still benefit financially from the telephones.\"\n\nSo, what if this choice is not true and the telephone equipment DOES weigh enough to make a material difference in fuel consumption? In that case, it's not clear that airlines benefit financially from the telephones. After all, in that case, it could be that the cost associated with the additional fuel consumption caused by having the telephones offsets any revenue the airlines get by having the telephones.\n\nThus, in that case, airlines may not benefit financially from having the telephones even though they collect a portion of the charge without having to pay for the equipment.\n\nSo, for the argument to work, this choice must be true.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThe argument doesn't rely on this assumption about the preferences of passengers who do not use the phones.\n\nAfter all, regardless of what these passengers prefer, it could still be the case that, since airlines get revenue by having the phones but don't have to pay for them, airlines benefit financially by having the phones on their planes.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice may be tempting if we're not clear regarding what we're looking for. After all, this choice is plausible. So, if we see that this choice is plausible and forget that we need a necessary assumption, we might choose it.\n\nAt the same time, this choice is incorrect. After all, we don't need a choice that's just plausible. We need a choice that states an assumption on which the argument depends, and the argument doesn't depend on any particular passengers using the phones. After all, as long as someone uses the phones, the airlines get a portion of the charges and thus may benefit financially.\n\nSo, regardless of whether this choice is true, the argument works.\n\nEliminate.\n\n C",

        "explanation": "(A)The first step in this Parallel Reasoning question is to abstract from the specifics of the stimulus. In general terms, the stimulus provides a case in which a statement uttered in response to a particular situation is attacked as an ineffectual response; there are only two possible scenarios, and both expose the futility of the statement (if the original position is wrong, the given response would make matters look worse; if the position is right; the response does nothing to prove it). The parallel choice we’re looking for should therefore show that a given response shouldn’t be used because, whether the party under attack is right or wrong, the response is ineffective. We don’t have to look far. (A) says that when a practice has been denounced, it shouldn’t be defended by saying, “this is how we’ve always done it.” The reason for this is exactly parallel to the original’s “lose-lose” element: if the practice is a poor one, the response makes matters look even worse; if the practice is wise, the answer doesn’t provide good support for it. (A) fits the stimulus form to a T.\n\n(B) Unlike the stimulus, there’s no issue of the initial opinion being right or wrong. Instead of being presented with two cases where a person who eats strange foods is wrong or right to do so, we’re given two ways the response will sound unsatisfying.\n\n(C) also begins with a response people shouldn’t make, but instead of showing why the justification is pointless in the cases of the person being right and being wrong, the argument attacks the response for avoiding the issue.\n\n(D) again fails to show why the scholars’ response is no good whether they are right or wrong, implying instead that they are probably partly right and partly wrong.\n\n(E) fails because it recommends two better ways of responding (admission of error or silence), whereas the stimulus was primarily interested in describing why the original response was no good whether the original statement was right or wrong.",

Yes, this option eliminates any alternate possibility. If the credit card buyers were significantly more interested in attending the event than the cash buyers were, then we cannot conclude that the reason the credit card buyers bid, on average, twice as much as the cash buyers bid was due to the fact the credit cards limit consumers' thoughts about price. We can keep this option. \n\n\n\nThe argument doesn't provide any correlation between the time spent thinking about an item's price and activities in the brain. Additionally, the statement doesn't affect the conclusion. The option is merely a distortion and we can eliminate it. \n\n\n\nThis is a trap choice. We know from the experiment conducted that credit card buyers bid on average, twice as much as the cash buyers bid.

You're supposed to look at it and say \"Well, if they can't even open the factory, won't that negate the conclusion?\" And you'd be right, if not for one little word in the passage: could. If this passage said, Company Y WILL make a big profit next year by building a factory, then answer choice A would be correct, because that makes it impossible for them to actually build the factory. \n\nBut this passage merely says they \"could\" make a profit by opening the factory. In this hypothetical universe, the factory has already opened. Whether or not there are impediments to making this happen is immaterial. The issue is whether the existence of the factory will make them a profit.\n\nA: Company Y will be able to obtain all the necessary permits to open a factory in Country X.\nProblem: We don't need to know how hard it is to make the factory.

Critics who disfavor awarding the art-form status to video-games argue that in contrast to a film adapted from a piece of literary fiction, which is a visual representation of a pre-fixed story-line, video-games cannot be considered art as they create a visually interactive space in which players experience games on their own terms. \n\nThe critics’ conclusion is properly drawn if which of the following is assumed?\n\nA.

The key facts are “money is universal across societies” and “money is not rooted in an innate ability, but is instead an artificial, human invention.” The desired conclusion is, “The invention of money probably occurred independently in more than one society.” We’re asked to find a sufficient assumption of the argument, which means “bridge the gap,” or “prove the conclusion to be true.”\n\nOne way to bridge the gap from facts to conclusion is, “Anything that is universal across societies but is not innate was probably invented independently in more than one society.” Another, equally good, answer would be, “Anything that is universal across societies but is an artificial human invention was probably invented independently in more than one society.”\n\nA) Yep. All societies have money. If there are some (one or more) societies that have never been influenced by any other society then they must have invented money independently. If they are so geographically isolated, it “seems probable” that they didn't influence other societies either. In that case, it “seems probable that the invention of money occured independently in more than one society.\"\n\nB) Nah, this answer definitely wouldn’t prove anything about mone oney. Language is innate, which is  money.\n\nC) I don’t think this would do it. Just because money is an invention doesn’t prove that it was independently invented more than once. Couldn’t money have been invented once, by the Babylonians let’s say, and then all other human cultures stole the idea? I don’t think this answer proves our conclusion.\n\nD) Whether or not money is useful is simply not the issue here.

        "explanation": "No stocks of the abandoned pigment existed after 1509.\n\n\nYes, the reason this option is option (A) is that it is tempting to jump to it right away. But it is incorrect.\n\nThe problem here is that the option says 'No stocks existed after 1509'.\nWe don't need to assume that. Recall that the argument says that Michelangelo stopped using the pigment, not that the pigment was not manufactured after 1509. It is immaterial whether stock of the pigment existed after 1509. We know that Michelangelo abandoned the use of the pigment after 1509. \n\nLook at the argument:\n- The painting must have been completed after 1507 but before 1509. \n- Not earlier than 1507 because one of its central figures carries a coin that was not minted until that year. \n- Not after 1509 because it contains a pigment that Michelangelo is known to have abandoned when a cheaper alternative became available in 1509.\n\nThe argument clearly tells us that Michelangelo abandoned the use of the pigment in 1509. Whether he had stocks of it or not, he abandoned its use in 1509. The argument seems pretty good fit except for one thing - it says that the painting must have been COMPLETED within 1507 to 1509. That's the folly of the argument. Based on the premises, we can say for sure that he painted it during this time frame. We cannot say whether he completed it during this time. \nHe could have painted it over many years which would include the time frame of 1507 - 1509. When we say that he completed it before 1509, we are assuming that he did the painting in a matter of a few weeks or months, not over many years. \n\nHence your answer is (B)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "To help us when we get to the answer choices, let's walk through what the consultant says, step by step.\n\n\nHere, the consultant introduces a discrepancy. Apparently, a \"significant number\" of repair jobs are not done correctly the first time. However, they are \"invariably done right\" on the second attempt. Why is this the case? The rest of the passage explores possible reasons for this discrepancy. \n\n\nFinally, the consultant gives us his/her own view about why there is a difference in repair rate success in Ace Repairs. He/she thinks that the mechanics pay more attention to jobs that have to be redone, which explains why the second attempt is so much more successful than the first attempt.\n\nIn this question, we're trying to determine which answer choice best describes the role the boldface portions play. Understanding the structure of the passage in the way outlined above should make it easier for us to work through the answer choices. \nThe first boldface portion describes the situation the consultant is trying to explain, it is not their main conclusion.\n\nSo (A) is out.\n\nThe first boldface portion is the finding the consultant is trying to explain. It isn't providing evidence to serve as the basis for rejecting one explanation -- that comes in the second, non-boldface sentence of the passage.\n\n(B) is out. \n\nThe truth of the first boldface is not \"at issue\" -- it is presented as a fact that is definitely true. The consultant then attempts to explain  it is true.\n\nThe second boldface is the consultant's explanation for  the discrepancy occurs, not evidence  the discrepancy occurs.  \n\nFor these reasons, we can cross (C) out.\n\nThis looks good -- the first section  describe the striking difference between two scenarios and contrasts them against each other. The second portion  provide the consultant's explanation for the situation introduced in the first portion.\n\nLet's keep (D).\n\nThe first part of (E) is the same as (D), so that bit is fine.\n\nHowever, the second boldface portion  the consultant's explanation of the contrast -- so, it's not used to  the consultant's explanation.\n\nThis means we can rule out (E), leaving us with (D) as our winner.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

Although there is no objective test for whiplash, this does not mean, as some suggest, that half of the reports of such injuries are fake. It could simply be that where insurance will not pay for such injuries, people are less inclined to report them.\n\n\n The first portion tells us about the correlation between reported cases of whiplash in countries and the willingness of insurance companies in those countries to compensate for whiplash injuries. The argument next states that whiplash is difficult to objectively verify. The argument then asserts that  this last fact, taken together with the first boldfaced portion, has led some to infer that over half of the reported cases in countries with the highest whiplash rates are spurious, . The second boldfaced portion then helps to explain why  by offering an alternative explanation.\n\n(A) The claim made in the first boldfaced portion is never disputed in the argument; at dispute is how to account for the fact that this claim is true. The second is not the argument's conclusion.\n\n(B) In a manner of speaking, perhaps, the argument uses the first portion to support its conclusion; but there is no indication that it has been used elsewhere to do so. In any case, the second boldfaced portion is not the argument's conclusion.\n\n(C) The first has been used to support a conclusion that the argument ; the second boldfaced portion is not the argument's conclusion.\n\n. This option correctly identifies the roles played in the argument by the boldfaced portions.\n\n(E) The accuracy of the first boldfaced portion is never questioned in the argument; nor is the second intended to somehow help show that the first is accurate. Rather, the argument assumes that the first portion is accurate.­\n\nThe bold faced portions at this link are different from the ones in the given question.\n\nThe answer for the given question should be D.\n\nLet's understand the argument:\n\n\n\n, - This is also a fact.\n\n. - This is an opinion of the author. He agrees that spurious reports of whiplash injuries cannot be easily identified. Pay attention to the language here. Even though no one has till now talked about spurious reports of whiplash injuries, the author has written this sentence in a way that shows agreement. Probably, the coming sentences will throw some light on this.\n\n. - Focus on 'Nevertheless'. It indicates change in direction. Now, read this statement along with the preceding statement. So, basically, in the preceding statement, the author was agreeing to the commentators, who have been referred to in this statement. So, even though the author agrees that identifying spurious cases might be a challenge, he disagrees that it means half the cases of whiplash injuries are spurious (If you are wondering why author refers to 'half' the cases, read the first statement again, which talks about twice the number of whiplash injuries).\n\n\n\n\nNow, if you look back and see what has happened in this argument, you can prethink the roles of the two Bold Faced parts:\n\nThe first bold faced part is an observation or fact on which the commentators based their opinion on.\n\nThe second bold faced part is an alternative explanation offered by the author, which counters the opinion of the commentators.\n\n\nNow, let's analyse the option statements:\n\n\n\n(A)  - Obviously, BF1 is not disputed in the argument. Incorrect.\n\n(B)  - First of all, BF1 is not a claim. It is a fact or a finding or an observation but not a claim. Secondly, we know from our analysis that BF1 has been used to support an explanation (of commentators) which is countered in the passage. So, Incorrect.\n\n(C)  - Like option B, the role of BF1 is not correctly mentioned in this. Besides, BF2 is not the main conclusion of the argument. Second last statement (which is not bolded) is the main conclusion of the argument. Incorrect.\n\n(D) - This is correct. What are the implications of BF1? The implications are the conclusion drawn by the commentators from BF1. We know that this is the issue of the argument. Besides, BF2 offers an alternate explanation for the finding to counter the explanation offered by commentators. So, the roles of both BF1 and BF2 are correctly mentioned. Correct.\n\n(E)  - The accuracy of BF1 is not evaluated in the argument. Incorrect.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nThanks,\nChiranjeev­\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Get 25 AI powered videos | 400 practice questions | 8 free webinars How a personalized study plan can save you 60+ hours M7 admits | INSEAD admits | ISB admits [40+ case studies]\n\nLearn why e-GMAT has 10X more 700+ verified scores than other GMATClub partners –",

The first is an observation that the candidate argues against; the second is an observation that the candidate supports.\n\nE. The first is an observation made by the candidate; the second is an assertion that the candidate ultimately opposes.\n\nThe conclusion, or ultimate position, of the political candidate is that older and disabled individuals should be offered drug coverage alternatives that, in contrast to plans built around individual choice, do not force them to gamble with their health. The first bold-faced statement is an observation that the candidate makes about the appeal of the choice-based plans; the use of the phrase \"deceptively appealing\" and the continuation of the argument makes it clear that the candidate views the appeal of these plans as unfortunate. The second bold-faced statement, that consumers cannot predict their future health needs, is an assertion that the candidate uses to support his ultimate position that alternative plans should be offered.\n\n(B) This choice correctly states that the second bold-faced statement is a claim that the candidate uses as evidence to support his ultimate position. However, the first bold-faced statement is not an observation to which the candidate is ultimately opposed; it is his own observation that the current prescription drug plans are \"deceptively appealing.\" His opposition is to the drug plans themselves, but that is not the observation made in the first statement.\n\n The first bold-faced statement, that coverage plans centered around choice are deceptively appealing, is an observation that the candidate acknowledges as true but unfortunate. The second bold-faced statement—that consumers cannot predict their future health needs—is an assertion that the candidate makes to support his ultimate position that alternative plans should be offered.\n\n(D) This choice incorrectly states that the candidate argues against the observation that choice plans are deceptively appealing to numerous stakeholders. This is the candidate's own observation; though he does view the fact as unfortunate, one cannot argue against one's own observation. Moreover, the second bold-faced statement is not an observation; instead, it is a claim used to support the candidate's ultimate conclusion that alternative plans should be offered.\n\n(E) This choice correctly states that the first bold-faced statement is an observation the candidate makes. However, the second bold-faced statement—that consumers cannot predict their future health needs—is not an assertion that the candidate opposes; instead, he uses this claim to support his ultimate position.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

The second boldface portion is cited as an intermediate conclusion in both cases, but does it support a judgement reached by the argument (the author) or does  it support a conclusion the author criticizes? \n\nIf we read past the bold portion (as we should!) we can see that the author believes that \"These commentators are, however, wrong to draw the further conclusion that in the countries with the higher rates of reported whiplash injuries, half of the reported cases are spurious\" and instead concludes that \"clearly, in countries where automobile insurance does not include compensation for whiplash, people often have little incentive to report whiplash injuries that they actually have suffered.\" \n\nSo, the second boldface portion supports a conclusion that works in contrast to the author's argument, and this perfectly aligns with  \"the second is an intermediate conclusion that has been used to support a conclusion that the argument criticizes.\" (and also happens to give us great support for eliminating !)\n\nSo, by recognizing that the first bold portion is a fact/piece of evidence and the second is an opinion or conclusion of some sort and realizing that the second portion supports a further conclusion that contrasts that of the author, we can use POE to eliminate all wrong answers and correctly conclude . \n\nI hope this helps!\n\nBest,\n\nHailey\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "A product that represents a clear technological advance over competing products can generally command a high price. Because  and companies want to make large profits while they still can, . But large profits on the new product will give competitors a strong incentive to quickly match the new product's capabilities. Consequently, the strategy to maximize overall profit from a new product is to charge less than the greatest possible price.\n\nIn the argument above, the two portions in  play which of the following roles?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The question tempts us to jump straight into the answer choices without first understanding the argument. But let’s focus first on the argument’s conclusion: “The strategy to maximize overall profit from a new product is to charge less than the greatest possible price.”\n\nNow let’s break down the argument -- and this one is pretty long and complicated. Ignore the boldface for now, because if we don’t understand how the argument works, we’ll have a hard time explaining the role of each portion:\n\n and companies want to make large profits while they still can, . - Many companies pursue the strategy of charging the max price. This is NOT the strategy recommended by the author.” - This is one of the two reasons why companies like to pursue the max-price strategy. The second reason is that “companies want to make large profits while they still can.”\nNow that we have a very concrete breakdown of the passage, we can analyze the abstract-sounding answer choices without our eyeballs dissolving. Note that the choices are each broken into two halves, so if we reject either half, then we can reject the entire choice.\n\nWe know that statement 1 explains why companies  to charge the max. However, choice (A) claims that statement 1 explains why charging the max is . That’s not what the “many companies” in this sentence believe, so let’s eliminate choice (A).\n\nChoice (B) claims that statement 1 is supporting the author’s preferred strategy (don’t charge the max). But statement 1 actually explains why many companies do the opposite (charge the max). \n\nAlso, statement 2 presents the strategy employed by many companies, not the strategy that the author recommends. Eliminate choice (B).\n\nChoice (C) matches our analysis precisely. Statement 2 lays out the strategy pursued by many companies (charging the max). Statement 1 states one of the two reasons  many companies decide to charge the max. Let’s keep this wonderfully straightforward answer choice and see if we can eliminate the rest.\n\nWe know that the author rejects the “charge-the-max” strategy followed by many companies. But does the author reject the fact that technological advances are quickly surpassed? No. The author believes this fact and recommends an alternate strategy with that knowledge. Eliminate choice (D).\n\nThe first half of choice (E) is fair enough. Considering that tech advantages don’t last long and that companies like profits, we can understand why many companies charge the max. However, does statement 2 (“many companies charge the maximum possible price for such a product”) present an intended outcome? No. The outcome of earning large profits is implied, but statement 2 simply states the strategy itself, not the intended outcome. Thus, the second half is definitely inaccurate, and we can eliminate choice (E).\n\nThe correct answer is (C).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "Hey All,\n\nGreat work on this one. I saw that the \"General approach\" question got asked on this one, so I thought I'd weigh in. This is an \"evaluate the argument\" type of question, and nsp is on the right track. Basically, you want to do your total outline WITHOUT PAYING ATTENTION TO THE BOLDS. Once you've done that, you can try to figure out where the bolds fit in with your outline. ALSO, very often, it is enough to simply differentiate between what pieces provide evidence of or support for something else, which are COUNTER-premises, and which are mere claims/conclusions. Let's try that here.\n\nFew businesses will voluntarily implement environmental rotection measures that benefit the public if those measures reduce profitability. Even though such measures may cost less to implement than the total value of their benefits to society, the company making the decision bears all of the cost and receives little, if any, of the benefit. For example, XYZ Corporation has for the last 10 years refused to install smokestack filters to reduce the air pollution emitted by its factory, claiming that the cost would be prohibitive.  Therefore, if such measures are to be implemented to protect the environment, they must be initiated by government regulation or intervention.\n\nConclusion: Measure to protect environment must be initiated by government\nPremises: Biz won't help environment if hurts profits. XYZ = concrete example of that premise.\n\nWhat you'll see here is that BOTH bolded statements end up in that premise area. Let's see if we can find the answer with that info alone.\n\nThe bolded portions of the argument above perform which of the following functions?\n\n1. The first phrase states the conclusion, and the second provides evidence, the truth of which supports the validity of the conclusion\nPROBLEM: Neither bold is a conclusion.\n\n2. The first phrase states a premise supporting the conclusion, and the second provides evidence, the falsity of which would disprove the first phrase.\nPROBLEM: Okay.

The government proposes to address the problem with a wide range of financial incentives, along with investments in improved health care, road safety and the like. These are positive measures, but . A better plan to reverse the population decline is to improve the country's governance in both the public and the private sphere. . In addition, if corruption and greed among the elite were curbed, public health would improve and average life expectancy would increase.\n\nThe two boldfaced statements serve what function in the argument above?\n",

The analyst then dismisses that proposal and makes a counterproposal that he or she then supports with hypothetical scenarios. The claim that the counterproposal (to try good governance) is preferable is the conclusion of the argument. \n\n(A) This choice is incorrect. The first boldface is a fact that indicates the government plan has failed before; it is not the conclusion of the argument. However, the second is a premise in support of the argument’s proposal. \n\n The first is the fact that the government plan has \"been tried before, to no avail,\" a fact that undermines the alternative proposal made by the government. The author's proposal is to improve the country's governance, and the second boldface supports that plan by showing one way in which better governance might lead to a population increase. \n\n(C) The first does not contradict the argument’s conclusion that improved governance will reverse the decline in population. Rather, it undermines the other proposal presented by the government, which is a claim that the argument does not support. The second is not the argument’s main point, but an assertion that supports the conclusion of the argument by showing one way in which better governance might lead to a population increase. \n\n(D) The first is a premise that the government plan has \"been tried before, to an avail,\" which weighs against the preceding proposal. The second is not the proposal that the first directly supports, but an assertion that supports the conclusion of the argument by showing one way in which better governance might lead to a population increase. \n\n(E) The first is not a conclusion at all, rather a factual premise that these measures \"have been tried before, to little avail.\" The second boldface does not oppose the first boldface, rather it is an assertion that supports the conclusion of the argument by showing one way in which better governance might lead to a population increase.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "The findings of recent research indicate that prolonged exposure to radiation from computer monitors diminishes mental capacity. The evidence cited in the study shows that workers who spend in excess of 20 hours per week directly in front of a computer monitor exhibit an average 12% reduction in cognitive abilities after 15 years in the same occupation.\n\nThe response to which of the following questions would be most helpful in evaluating the reasoning presented in the survey?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "This is a “Useful to Evaluate” question, which borrows many tactics from traditional Strengthen/Weaken questions. (The leverage phrase in the question stem, “which… would be most helpful in evaluating…” clearly indicates this question type.) With Useful to Evaluate questions, \"Minding the Gap\" is critical. The correct answer will either plug the gap (Strengthen) or explode the gap (Weaken). Trap answers will not address the logical gap.\n\nThe primary logical gap in this question is the disconnect between the data and the conclusion. While the data tells us that workers who spend 20+ hours in front of a computer monitor exhibit a 12% reduction in cognitive abilities after 15 years, we don’t know if that 12% reduction is actually caused by the exposure or if it might be caused by something else during those 15 years. (For example, what if most people who sit at a job for 15 years see a much greater decline in cognitive ability? A mere 12% reduction could actually show that sitting in front of computer monitors keep your brain relatively sharp! Alternatively, what if it isn’t the radiation that causes the decline; instead, sitting in one position for 15 years is what actually causes it?) We need to find the answer choice that addresses this gap in some way.\n\nAnswer choice A “moves the goalposts” on the reader, getting the reader to think that the reversibility (or permanency) of the damage matters. This introduces an emotional, human component to the story, but one that isn’t related to the logical gap. A is a trap answer.\n\nAnswer choice B traps those who misunderstand what the problem is asking. While questioning the 15-year period might be interesting if someone is evaluating the study as a whole, the question stem explicitly asks us to identify the question that can best help us evaluate the specific reasoning presented. Answer choice B does not address the logical gap between the data and the conclusion.\n\nAt first glance, answer choice C looks like it helps us to compare the rates of cognitive decline across a spectrum of various occupational tasks. However, answer choice C is a Yes/No question that doesn’t really help us much: if the answer is “No”, then it appears that occupational tasks might not determine cognitive decline. But if we answer “Yes”, then we only know that there .\n\nAnswer choice D doesn’t mind the logical gap. In fact, the problem states that the “average” cognitive decline was 12%. This data point implies that either (1) all of the participants somehow had the exact same 12% drop, or (2) some people were above and others were below the 12% average. That is how “average” works. It is very likely that the data was spread around the 12% average, so D tells us very little. And D certainly doesn’t address the lack of clear causal link between monitor exposure and cognitive decline.\n\nAnswer choice E gives us a strong comparative that can help us prove (or disprove) a potential causal link. The answer to the question in this answer choice would give us a measurable number against which we can compare the 12% cognitive decline. Whether the cognitive decline rate of the average worker is higher than, lower than, or equal to the measured 12% decline, such data could give us strong leverage to evaluate the reasoning in the argument. </span>",

Last year, John ran an average of four times per week. This year, John is looking to increase the distance he runs per week by at least 50 percent. Therefore, John plans to run at least six times a week this year.\n\nWhich of the following is required for this year’s running plan to achieve its aim?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Conclusion:John plans to run at least six times a week this year, in order to increase the distance he runs per week by at least 50 percent.\n\nPremise: Last year, John ran an average of four times per week. This year, to increase his speed and endurance, and thus improve his running time in a marathon, John is looking to increase the distance he runs per week by at least 50 percent.\n\nAssumption: There are no problems with the plan. Running at least six times a week will result in at least a 50 percent increase in the distance John runs per week.\n\nThe question stem asks what is required for this year’s plan to achieve its aim, so this is an Assumption question. The argument uses a planning reasoning pattern, which can be identified because the passage contains a plan to run at least six times a week with a goal to increase the distance he runs per week by at least 50 percent.\n\nThe standard assumption of a planning reasoning pattern is that there are no problems with the plan. In other words, that the plan to run at least six times a week this year, will cause John to increase the distance he runs per week by at least 50 percent. Evaluate the answer choices, looking for one that matches this idea.\n\nChoice A: No. A longer distance for each run is extreme language. It is only necessary that John run the same distance for each run on average in order for his total distance run to increase and thus allow the plan to work.\n\nChoice B: No. This answer choice is out of scope. The mere risk of injury does not affect the number of times per week John will run, nor the distance he travels per week.\n\nChoice C: No. Shorter distance is extreme language. Use the negation test. If The two additional runs per week will not be for a shorter distance than the average distance...per run last year, there is no problem with the plan. John will still be able to increase the distance he runs per week by at least 50 percent.\n\nChoice D: No. Longest run is extreme language. Use the negation test. If John does not increase the distance he runs for his longest run each week by 50 percent, there is no problem with the plan. John will still be able to increase the distance he runs per week by at least 50 percent because the total distance he runs each week is dependent on all of his runs per week, not just the longest run.\n\nChoice E: Correct. This choice is supported by the argument. Use the negation test. If The average distance per run...this year is not at least as long as the average distance...per run last year, then the plan will not work to increase the distance he runs per week by at least 50 percent.\n\nThe correct answer is choice E.",

SV40 is a monkey virus; however, in 1960 some polio vaccine was contaminated with the virus.

That's the actual argument we are trying to support, the link between the SV40 in the vaccine and the SV40 in the mesothelioma tissue.  \n\nWell,  merely strengthens the evidence.  We already were told that there was SV40 virus in the polio vaccine.  That's already beyond doubt.  Statement  strengthens this statement that is already beyond doubt, but it doesn't say squat about the link to mesothelioma. The researchers were hypothesizing this link between SV40 virus in the vaccines and mesothelioma, and , while it verifies --- \" is very powerful.  If the SV40 virus in the vaccines really is the source of the virus in the mesothelioma tissue, then if we found some case in which there was  SV40 virus in the vaccine, then we would expect to find  SV40 virus in the mesothelioma tissue.    provides this new and very cogent evidence.  This is new, different from what was stated in the passage, although it provides strong support to the passage.   In general, if I make the argument that P and only P causes Q, then part of what I am predicting is --- if there's no P, then there should be no Q.  That would be very powerful evidence for this claim, and this is precisely the nature of the powerful evidence that  provides.

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Context:\nConstruction moves faster in good weather so mild winters in areas that usually experience harsh conditions can appear to create construction booms.\n\nPremise:\n- construction loans are often obtained more than a year in advance\n\nConclusion: Forecasting one mild winter or even two for such areas generally does not lead to overall increases in construction\n\nWe are looking for another premise that tells us why forecasting one mild winter does not lead to increased construction. \nWe are told already that construction loans need to be taken a year in advance. But then, if the forecast happens early enough, the loans could be taken in advance for the forecasted mild winter. \n\nThen why is it not done?\n\nA) construction workers often travel to warmer climates in the wintertime in search of work\n\nDoesn't help. If a mild winter is forecasted and builders plan to expedite construction during that time, workers are likely to stick around. The workers move to warmer climates in search of work. If work is available and climate is better, they are likely to not move. Something like \"workers are not available in winters because they visit their families in the south at that time\" might have been more convincing. \n\nB) construction materials are often in short supply during construction booms\n\nThis talks about what happens \"during\" construction boom. We are given that construction booms do not happen. \n\nC) many builders in these areas are likely to apply for construction loans at the same time\n\nWhat does that imply? Do they all get refused? \nThey could all apply in advance for mild winters.\n\nD) it is frequently the case that forecasted weather trends do not actually occur\n\nCorrect. If forecasted trends do not actually occur then a forecasted mild winter will not lead to extra construction. The builders will not know whether forecasted mild winters will occur and will have reason to believe that it will not (because forecasted trends do not usually occur). So they will not apply for loan in advance.

If we roll two dice one time, our chances of getting at least one 3 are significantly higher (~30%). If we roll ten dice one time, our chances of getting at least one 3 are pretty good (~84%). If we roll a hundred dice one time, we're extremely likely to get at least one 3 (&gt;99.99%). So even though the probability of getting a 3 on any one die isn't super high, the more dice we roll, the more likely at least one of the dice will give us a 3.\n\nBringing it back to this problem: it's not very likely that the survey is going to give us a false result for any one ailment. However, we did test  of them. So even though the probability of getting an incorrect statistic for any one ailment is low, the more statistics we test, the more likely at least one of them will give us a false result. In other words, because we tested so many ailments, there's a pretty high likelihood that the result for one of the ailments is false — that an ailment shows a statistically significant difference near power lines vs. away from power lines when it actually shouldn't.

Out of scope. \n\n(B)\t the additional tests required to confirm the diagnosis are especially taxing on men over 75.\nDon't know what \"taxing\" means.

Somewhat okay if we assume that no display of the symptoms is as good as having no cancer at all. So, no treatment OR action will really be necessary. Pretty convincing, I say.\n\n(D)\t the fact that PSA is present in the body does not itself strongly suggest that prostate cancer is present.\nWell, we already know that. What's new?\n\n(E)\t testing for PSA, along with necessary follow-up tests, is very expensive, and many men over 75 do not have private health insurance\nI call this having information from outside. This should be avoided. The conclusion should be made only on the basis of the premises we know AND none of those talks about health insurance or monetary capabilities of people above 75.

While this may make the plan a bad idea, this does not conclude why it would exacerbate the unemployment issue.\n\nB) Tempting choice, however this does not really tell us why having more people with college degrees would make unemployment worse. Sure, there could be more vocational jobs than jobs that require degrees, but there is no reason why someone with a degree would not be able to go into a vocational job with some additional training. \n\nC) This is the correct answer. Suppose there are 10 jobs in the economy, and only 5 graduates. Then, it would be very easy for those 5 graduates to get a job. However, if now there are only 10 jobs, but 50 graduates, then you have 40 graduates without a job left over.

The textbook authors generally wish to reflect the consensus among musicologists and critics regarding what are the greatest works in musical history. Thus, the consensus of these experts must be that the vast majority of history's greatest orchestral music was produced more than fifty years ago, since __\n\nWhich of the following, if correct, would most logically complete the music student's argument?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The music student has concluded the following:\n\n\n\nThe support provided for that conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nThose premises provide some support for the conclusion. At the same time, we can pick up on the fact that there is a gap in the argument. The gap is basically the following: the evidence is that the textbooks devote only a small amount of coverage to the music of the past fifty years and the conclusion is about what the experts believe about when the greatest orchestral music was produced.\n\nIf we think about the evidence  and the conclusion, we see that  and that most great orchestral music was produced more than 50 years ago.\n\nDoes the fact that there is just a small amount of coverage indicate what experts believe? Maybe, but there must be some kind of assumption or additional fact connecting the two.\n\n\n\nThe word \"since\" before the blank is a support indicator. So, the choice that logically fills the blank will provide additional support for conclusion, which directly precedes \"since\" in the passage.\n\n\n\nThis choice does just what we need.\n\nThe correct answer must provide additional support for the conclusion.\n\nMeanwhile, as discussed above, the argument has a gap in it in that it jumps from a premise about the amount of coverage in textbooks of the last 50 years to a conclusion about what experts believe.\n\nSo, this choice provides additional support for the conclusion by connecting the evidence about the amount of coverage of the music of the past 50 years to the belief of experts by connecting the two. After all, if \"the authors intended the textbooks to ,\" then the fact that there is not much coverage of the orchestral music of the past 50 years indicates that \n\nThus, if it's also true that \" regarding what are the greatest works in musical history,\" then as the music student has concluded, \"the consensus of these experts must be that the vast majority of history's greatest orchestral music was produced more than fifty years ago.\"\n\nSo, this choice logically completes the argument by filling a gap between the premises and the conclusion. We could say that this choice works like an assumption on which the argument depends.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThis choice is tempting because it could seem to support the conclusion. After all, if it's true that \"no expert judge of musical quality considers most of the orchestral music produced in the past fifty years to be among history's greatest,\" then it sort of follows that \"the consensus of these experts must be that the vast majority of history's greatest orchestral music was produced more than fifty years ago.\"\n\nAt the same time, this choice doesn't do what we need since it doesn't fit the context of the argument as a whole.\n\nAfter all, the fact that \"no expert judge of musical quality considers most of the orchestral music produced in the past fifty years to be among history's greatest\" doesn't help to explain why the music student has gone from the fact that \"textbooks on the history of orchestral music generally devote only a small amount of coverage to the music of the past fifty years\" to the conclusion that \"the consensus of these experts must be that the vast majority of history's greatest orchestral music was produced more than fifty years ago.\"\n\nInstead, this choice just jumps in from a different angle by simply stating that experts don't consider most music from the past 50 years to be among history's greatest.\n\nOK, that fact might support the conclusion, but what does it have to do with the rest of the argument? Nothing.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe choice weakens the case for the conclusion of the argument in the passage.\n\nAfter all, if the textbooks simply devote the most coverage to music the authors have studied, then the fact that the books devote only a small amount of coverage to the orchestral music of he past 50 years isn't a reason to believe anything about the consensus of experts. Rather, if this choice were true, all that would be going on would be that the authors didn't devote much coverage to the music of the past 50 years because they haven't studied it much.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice provides no support for the conclusion of the argument. The fact that the music covered is considered among the greatest doesn't indicate anything about experts' consensus on  most great orchestral music was produced.\n\nSimply put, the fact that all the music covered is the greatest is not a reason to conclude that experts believe that there was more great music produced during one period than during another.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice could support the conclusion since, if experts developed their expertise by studying textbooks that don't devote much coverage to the orchestral music of the past 50 years, then it makes sense that the experts could end up believing that most great orchestral music was produced more than 50 years ago.\n\nAt the same time, this choice does not make sense in the context of the argument as a whole. After all, it doesn't make sense that \"the textbook authors ... wish to reflect the consensus among musicologists and critics\" and that, at the same time, the experts get their ideas from the textbooks.\n\nSo, the authors of the textbooks would be seeking to reflect the consensus of experts who got their information from the textbooks?

If you just look at the question stem, you might erroneously that this is an Inference question type, because of the phrase \"\" is what I call in my classes a \" show that environmental regulations promote growth.\" The correct answer would  the growth. (For example, what if a third factor -- such as an abundance of natural resources -- causes both growth and environmental regulations to happen? What if the causal relationship goes the  direction -- that high growth causes states to enact environmental regulations? There is no way to tell given the limited facts in the question!) The GMAT is hoping that, because it mentioned growth and environmental regulations in close proximity that you make the assumption they are related. If we can find an answer that shows growth might be caused by something else, we have our answer.\n\nAnswer choice “” states that states with strict environmental regulations share another attribute: they invest the most in education and job training. Now, at first glance, this is a  high growth. We have to insert in extra information in order to show that this new factor could truly prove the real causal link. However -- and this is crucial for those of you taking the GMAT -- \"\" logically completes the argument. Answer choice “”  introduce other possible factors that could be connected to high growth. If all of the other answer choices fail to undermine the assumed causal link between regulations and growth, then this answer -- as weak as it is -- still \"\" logically completes the argument. If this question showed up on my GMAT, I would reserve judgement on “” until I looked at the other answer choices.\n\nAnswer choice “” does the opposite of what we want, by ” can be quickly eliminated.\n\nAnswer choice “” is a beautifully-crafted trap. It says that \"” suffers from the same problem that the original argument does: we assume that the states are \"” doesn't truly undermine the idea that strict regulations can promote economic growth.\n\nAnswer choice “” also reinforces that assumed causal link. Get rid of it!\n\nAnswer choice “” is completely irrelevant to the logical gap. Just because \" growth. “” doesn't undermine the assumed causal link. We can quickly eliminate it.\n\nIn the end, only one answer choice even gets us close to undermining the assumed causal link between environmental regulations and economic growth. Two answer choices (\"\" and \"\") do the exact opposite of what we want, strengthening the possibility of a causal link. Two answer choices (\"\" and \"\") don't mind the logical gap. These fail to come up with an alternative explanation for why states experience economic growth. Only one answer is left over. And it is total weak sauce. This is what I call in my classes a \"\". You just need the answer choice that does it . And \"</span>\" is the only one that gets close.",

        "question": "Due to high jet fuel costs, airline carriers are looking for new ways to increase revenues and thereby counteract declining profits. Airline A has proposed increasing the number of passengers that can fit on its airplanes by creating several standing room only \"seats\" in which passengers would be propped against a padded backboard and held in place with a harness. This proposal, since it relates to passenger safety, cannot be implemented without prior approval by the Federal Aviation Administration. \n\nThe above statements, if true, indicate that Airline A has made which of the following conclusions? \n\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Only two pieces of information are given about Airline A's standing room \"seats\" proposal. First, that it is geared toward increasing revenue in order to counteract declining profits. And second, that, since the proposal relates to passenger safety, it must be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. Airline A must have concluded that the cost of implementation of its proposal is less than the revenue that the new seats will generate.\n\n Since Airline A knows that its proposal would have to comply with safety standards, it must have concluded that the cost of compliance is worth it. In other words, the only way for Airline A to achieve its goal of increasing profit is to implement ideas that will generate more revenue than they cost. Airline A must therefore have concluded that the standing room only \"seats\" meet this criteria.\n\n(B) The statements in the passage imply nothing about whether Airline A believes that the Federal Aviation Administration will approve the proposal. Although Airline A must believe that the proposal has a chance of being approved (otherwise it's unlikely to have proposed it), the airline might have proposed its specific plan knowing that it might not be approved or, that it might have to be changed in certain ways.\n\n(C) Airline A's goal is simply to \"counteract declining profits\" caused by the high cost of jet fuel. This does not mean, however, that the proposal must fully mitigate the cost of jet fuel. As long as the proposal increases revenue without a corollary increase in cost, it will in some way (even if it's relatively small) counteract declining profits.\n\n(D) The passage does not mention any other ways that Airline A has considered increasing revenue. Therefore, it is impossible to conclude anything about Airline A's perception of its standing room \"seats\" proposal to any other ideas.\n\n(E) The statements in the passage do not address Airline A's view regarding the safety of the standing room only \"seats\". It is very possible that Airline A views its proposal as safe and sees no conflict between passenger safety and increasing revenue, much less that it has made any determination about the relative importance of these two issues.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

The availability of energy-efficient equipment will reduce the energy costs of the restaurant industry by approximately 30 percent.\nPassage does not support that energy will be reduced by 30% although squandering will be reduced by energy efficient equipments, by what percentage it is not clear.\n\nB. No industry in the United States spends greater than $10 billion each year on energy.\nPremise 1 says this industry is largest squanderer not that it is the largest user.\n\nC. By using energy-efficient technology, a small restaurant will reduce its expenses by a greater percentage than will a large restaurant.\nAgain no support in the passage.\n\nD.

Maybe there are other factors also but they may be small as compared to the main factor sited in the passage.\n\nE.

The evidence suggests that the salicylic acid must plan some role.   This is promising.  \n\n . \nThis is the error discussed in #1 above.\n\n \nHmmm.  Is it the level of salicylic acid, or the rate of increase in salicylic acid that makes a difference?  This is not clear from the passage, so this choice is not a clear conclusion.   \n\n \nHmm.  That first part is really iffy ---- could we genetically engineer the tobacco plants so that they produce more salicylic acid?  Maybe, or maybe not.  Genetic engineering can certainly do a whole lot, but could it do this?   Unclear.

It is indeed likely that such a collision did occur and that it caused the death of the vast majority of dinosaurs. However, new evidence suggests that perhaps tens of thousands of dinosaurs lived far enough from the point of collision that they were not directly killed by the impact or by the drastic change in temperature when immense dust clouds created by the impact blocked the sun. Some other force must have been responsible for the death of these remaining dinosaurs.\n\nIf all the statements above regarding the possible asteroid collision with Earth are true, then what conclusion can be drawn from them?\n\n",

        "question": "Superficially, college graduates in 1982 resembled college graduates of 1964; they were fairly conservative, well dressed, and interested in tradition; they respected their parents. But there was a deep-seated difference: a majority of the members of the class of 1982 who were surveyed in their freshman year stated that making a good income was an important reason for their decision to go to college.\n\nThe statements in the passage, if true, best support which of the following conclusions?\n\n",
        "answer": "Formatted.",
        "explanation": "The passage claims that 1982 and 1964 college graduates were similar except that a majority of the 1982 graduates stated during their freshman year that making a good income was an important reason for going to college. This implies that fewer than half of the 1964 class, as freshmen, stated that making a good income was an important reason for going to college.  \n\nA is incorrect. The passage discusses differences in financial reasons for attending college, as expressed by freshmen in the two classes. Nothing is stated about the financial worries of either class as graduates. Neither is it clear from the passage that financial worries are necessarily implied by the desire to make a good income. C is also incorrect. The passage implies that desire for a good income was a more important reason for the members of the class of 1982 to decide to go to college than for the members of the class of 1964. However, the passage does not provide information on whether a college education provides more, less, or the same impact on income for the 1964 graduates as compared to the 1982 graduates. This fourth choice is incorrect. The passage does not describe or imply any difference in the reasons for attending college between freshman year and college graduation for either class. The last answer choice is also incorrect. The passage states that the 1964 and 1982 college graduates were both firmly conservative. Thus, the passage does not support any conclusion that the two classes differed in degree of conservatism.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

The police chief says \"We're trying to decide whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.\" Think about it. How could those two possibilities exist at once? It's a prison.

        "question": "In an effort to lower the average price over the long term for electricity generated from wind turbines, the national government of Mongrove plans to offer large, temporary tax reductions to companies that sell wind-generated electricity, which will allow those companies to lower prices to competitive levels and thus increase the amount of wind-generated electricity they sell. An economist argues that this approach will not yield the desired long-term result. She claims that the tax reductions will keep prices for wind-generated electricity artificially low, and thus that prices will return to their previous levels as soon as the taxes do. \n\nWhich of the following information would be most valuable to know in evaluating the economist's argument?\n",

        "question": "In an attempt to increase store traffic and profits, a department store conducted a survey of shoppers to determine what factors most influence their decisions on where to shop. Shoppers were asked to rank six factors: product selection, aisle width, customer service, pricing, fitting rooms, and return policy. Nearly 70 percent of the shoppers ranked fitting rooms as the number one issue. Therefore, the store doubled its number of fitting rooms by dividing each of its existing fitting rooms in half. Within a month of remodeling, store traffic and profits decreased significantly.\n\nThe information above most strongly supports which of the following explanations of why the store's response to the survey failed to increase store traffic and profits?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The passage presents a situation involving a surprising outcome: after the store took steps to address \"the number one issue\" cited by shoppers, \"fitting rooms,\" traffic and profits decreased.\n\n\n\nThis is a Paradox or Best Explains question, and the correct answer will be the one that best explains why the outcome of the remodeling was not the one expected.\n\n\n\nThis choice is interesting.\n\nAccording to the passage, the factor in the survey that was ranked most important by most shoppers was \"fitting rooms.\"\n\nAn issue that we an notice is that \"fitting rooms\" doesn't indicate much. What does \"fitting rooms\" mean? Does it mean that shoppers want more fitting rooms? Bigger fitting rooms? Easier access to fitting rooms? More time in fitting rooms? The survey doesn't indicate anything specific about fitting rooms.\n\nThen, after the survey was conducted, the store made two changes to fitting rooms with only the information that \"fitting rooms\" is an important factor: it added fitting rooms and made the fitting rooms smaller.\n\nOf course, it could be that the survey respondents weren't indicating that they like there to be many fitting rooms. Their point could even could have been that they like large fitting rooms, but without such specific information, the store added to and shrank the fitting rooms, a move that backfired.\n\nSo, it's logical that the reason for the surprising outcome is that the survey was not specific enough.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot creating a sufficient number of new fitting rooms would not explain why the store's response failed to increase store traffic and profits.\n\nAfter all, creating even some new fitting rooms would theoretically be an improvement.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe survey asked shoppers to rank factors in order of importance.\n\nSo, even if the respondents weren't truthful, they just ranked the factors out of order. In other words, they indicated that fitting rooms were important when in reality they were not.\n\nOK, great. So, in that case, fitting rooms are not as important as they said. So, why then would traffic and profits have decreased when the fitting rooms were changed?\n\nIn a way, this choice, if true, would deepen the mystery rather than help to explain what occurred.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nIf not enough people were surveyed, the store may have gotten inaccurate information regarding what most shoppers consider most important.\n\nAll the same, adding fitting rooms could have been expected to result in a least some increase in traffic and profits if fitting rooms are very important to at least some customers.\n\nEliminate.\n\n A",

        "question": "When hypnotized subjects are told that they are deaf and are then asked whether they can hear the hypnotist, they reply, \"No.\" Some theorists try to explain this result by arguing that the selves of hypnotized subjects are dissociated into separate parts, and that the part that is deaf is dissociated from the part that replies.\n\nWhich of the following challenges indicates the most serious weakness in the attempted explanation described above?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since we are trying to weaken an explanation, let's start by making sure we understand that explanation clearly:\n\nFirst, let's look at the result that we are trying to explain: \"When hypnotized subjects are told that they are deaf and are then asked whether they can hear the hypnotist, they reply, 'No.'\" -  This seems like a paradox.\n\n hear the question. But how could you have heard the question if you are deaf? Were you lying?\nSome theorists offer the following explanation: \"the selves of hypnotized subjects are dissociated into separate parts, and that the part that is deaf is dissociated from the part that replies.\" So what the heck does that mean?\n\nAccording to the theorists, the non-deaf part hears and replies to the question. Meanwhile, the  part is deaf. But if the subject is using the -deaf part to hear and reply to the question, that part should respond, \"Yes!\" to the question.\n\nSure, (A) does not PROVE that the theorists are wrong. Perhaps the hearing part is like a sports commentator who \"watches\" the deaf part and, like a good commentator,  that the other part is deaf.\n\nThe theorists  have a good answer to this challenge, but (A) definitely illustrates a serious weakness in the theorists' explanation. Hang on to (A).\n\nIn other words, (B) asks, \"Why do we even need to explain this paradoxical result?\". Well, regardless of whether there is a good  for explaining the result, the theorists have come up with an explanation. And we need an answer choice that indicates a weakness in that explanation. (B) does not illustrate a weakness, so eliminate this one.\n\nUnlike (A), choice (C) does not hit on a major flaw in the theorists' explanation. The theorists might not care  the subjects accept the suggestion. They only care about how the subjects reply to the question. The theorists' explanation might even help answer this question.\n\n(C) does not indicate a serious weakness in the theorists' explanation, so eliminate this one.\n\nAgain, does this question indicate a serious flaw in the theorists' explanation? If anything, the theorists' explanation might help answer this question: \"Well, they all respond the same way because they are all divided into a deaf part and a non-deaf part.\"\n\nUnlike (A), (D) does not address the theorists' logical flaw. Eliminate (D).\n\nAs with (C) and (D), this challenge does not indicate a serious weakness in the theorists' explanation. The theorists might not have a good explanation for WHY the self is always divided into the same separate parts. Regardless, their theory could explain the paradoxical result. In other words, the theorists aren't trying to explain how or why the division happens. They simply believe that the division explains the result. Eliminate (E).\n\n(A) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

What if his reason for not obeying is that he is not getting the reward of obeying? What if both stop obeying if rewards are withheld from both?

Let's begin eliminating choices:\n\nThis choice elaborates on what HDL literally does in the blood stream, but we already know that HDL is \"good.\" Because (A) doesn't have any impact on Nandipa's conclusion (consume foods that contain HDL), we can eliminate it.\n\nIf true, this weakens the conclusion. Whereas the only thing we knew before is that more HDL is good for heart health, this choice tells us that the benefit of HDL is limited to its effect on LDL levels. Nandipa's LDL levels are already in the optimal range, so consuming foods with HDL will deliver no additional benefit to her heart health. Let's keep (B) around unless we see something more game-changing.\n\nThe conclusion has nothing to do with consumption of food containing LDL, and this choice doesn't provide information that links LDL to HDL. Eliminate (C).\n\nWe already know that Nandipa has a plant-based diet. This new information about what her diet does to the sum of LDL and HDL is irrelevant, because we're are analyzing whether Nandipa should modify that diet by consuming foods that contain HDL (such as chicken or fish). (D) doesn't impact the conclusion we care about, so we'll eliminate it.\n\nLike answer choice (A), this choice underscores something we already know. Who cares how many foods have HDL? We want to know whether Nandipa ; it doesn't matter whether they're chicken, fish, eggs, steak, dosas, pie, bhindi masala, carne asada burritos, vanilla pudding, lamb tagine, Bavarian pretzels, or anything else that might increase HDL levels.

Alicia was stopped because the car she was driving had defective taillights.

        "question": "Motorcycle-safety courses, offered by a number of organizations, teach motorcyclists important techniques for handling and for safely sharing the road with other road users. If more motorcyclists took these courses, there would be fewer serious motorcycle accidents. Data show that 92% of the motorcyclists who are involved in a serious motorcycle accident have never taken a motorcycle-safety course. \n\nIn assessing whether the data cited provided support for the position taken about motorcyclists' taking the courses, it would be most useful to determine which of the following?\n\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is an evaluate question.  We need to identify the central assumption and find an answer choice that, when answered, would either strengthen or weaken the conclusion.\n\nThe argument is: Because 92% of motorcyclists involved in bad motorcycle accidents have never taken a safety course (evidence), there would be fewer bad motorcycle accidents if more motorcyclists took safety courses (conclusion). \n\nA shift in scope underpins the central assumption: that  motorcyclists involved in bad motorcycle accidents (the sample) are representative of motorcyclists in general (the group).  We have data on the sample (92% don't have training), but we need a way to compare that data to similar data for the group as a whole.\n\nSo we can expect that the answer will address the sample's representativeness in some way.\n\nA - Correct. If significantly more than 8% of motorcyclists in general (the group) have taken a safety course, we can then compare that to the implied 8% of the sample who have taken a safety course.  For instance, if 25% of the group has taken a safety course, but only 8% of the sample has taken a safety course, then there's a strong negative correlation between motorcyclists who have taken safety courses and those who have been involved in bad accidents. This strengthens the argument. Now let's say that only 1% of the group has taken a safety course; that means that there's a strong positive correlation between motorcyclists who have taken safety courses and those who have been involved in bad accidents. This weakens the argument. \nB - Out of scope; argument says nothing about passengers\nC - Also out of scope; we're not interested in comparing between different safety courses.\nD - A few previous posters selected this, so let's puzzle it out. It mentions the 92% proportion and so might address representativeness--but it only mentions the 92% in connection with collisions with other vehicles in motion, which is irrelevant. Note that we're no longer talking about the 92% of motorcyclists involved in bad accidents without training; we're talking about 92% of all bad accidents. This is a shift in scope. \nE - Also out of scope; we're not interested in the influence of size/speed, but taking vs. not-taking a safety course",

        "question": "Motor-scooter dealers attribute a drastic decline in sales over the last few years to a new law requiring motor-scooter riders to wear helmets. Previously, helmets had been obligatory for motorcycle riders but not for motor-scooter riders-a difference that the dealers argue made scooters preferable for many customers. Safety advocates, however, dispute the dealers' explanation, pointing out that the law's introduction coincided with a large increase in the cost of mandatory insurance for both types of vehicle.\n\nIn evaluating the safety advocates' and the dealers' explanations, it would be most helpful to know which of the following?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Information that helps with evaluating an explanation will support or cast doubt on that explanation. So, we're looking for the choice that names information that would support or cast doubt on the explanations, and since we have two different explanations, the information will probably support one while casting doubt on the other.\n\n\n\nKnowing this would not help with evaluating the argument.\n\nAfter all, regardless of whether there were \"any\" motor-scooter riders who regularly wore helmets before the law required them to do so, the law could still have affected most motor-scooter riders, who went from not having to wear helmets if they rode motor-scooters to having to wear helmets.\n\nIn other words, \"any motor-scooter riders\" could be a tiny percentage of motor-scooter riders, in which case, the helmet law would still have made a difference to the vast majority of motor-scooter riders.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nNotice that this choice mentions \"the same rate.\" \"The same rate\" is just one specific thing, a rate that is the same.\n\nHaving information on whether the cost increased at \"the same rate\" wouldn't help.\n\nAfter all, if the cost of insurance for other motor vehicles has increased at the same rate as that for motor scooters and motorcycles, then it still could be the case that people became less inclined to buy motor scooters because of either the helmet law or the increase in the insurance rate. Maybe people just didn't feel like spending the money, or maybe they didn't want to wear helmets.\n\nAlternatively, if the cost of insurance for other motor vehicles has not increased at the same rate, we have no idea about what happened with that cost. Did it increase? Decrease? Remain the same? We don't know.\n\nSo, this information either makes no difference or has unclear implications.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nKnowing this would not help with evaluating the argument. Here's why.\n\nPresumably, the accident rates for motor scooters and motorcycles would have remained about the same over time, or at least haven't suddenly changed \"drastically.\" So, how the two rates compare has likely remained about the same over time as well.\n\nSomething that remains about the same would not explain or cause a new change such as a \"drastic decline.\" In fact, it's useful for CR to keep in mind that, in general, something that remains the same will not be the cause of a new change.\n\nSo, knowing how the accident rate for motor scooters compares to the accident rate for motorcycles would not help in evaluating the argument since that comparison would not be an alternative cause for the \"drastic decline in sales over the last few years.\"\n\nThus, regardless of how the two accident rates compare, that information would not be reason to believe or not believe the safety advocates' and the dealers' explanations.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nRegardless of how sales of imported motor scooters have changed compared with sales of domestically produced models, it's still the case that, after the helmet law came into existence and insurance rates increased, overall sales of motor scooters declined. So, having the information mentioned by this choice would not really change what we know about the scenario.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nHaving this information would help us to evaluate the argument. Here's how.\n\nMotorcycles that are close in purchase price to motor scooters are products similar to motor scooters.\n\nAlso, we know from the passage that insurance rates have increased for both motor cycles and motor scooters.\n\nOn the other hand, the helmet law change applies to motor scooters only.\n\nLet's consider some ways sales of motorcycles that are close in purchase price to motor scooters could have changed.\n\nIncreased - In this case, sales of motor scooters have declined while sales of similarly priced motorcycles have increased. That information would tend to confirm that the helmet law made the difference since the increase in insurance rates didn't cause the sales of motorcycles to decline.\n\nRemained the same - In this case, we have a situation similar to the one in which sales of motorcycles increased. Sales of motor scooters have declined while sales of similarly priced motorcycles have remained the same. That information would tend to confirm that the helmet law made the difference since the increase in insurance rates didn't cause the sales of motorcycles to decline.\n\nDecreased - In this case, sales of motorcycles have declined just as sales of scooters have. That information would support the conclusion that the increase in insurance cost caused the decline in motor-scooter sales since both motor-scooter sales and also motorcycle sales declined at the same time, the change in insurance costs affected them both, and the helmet law affected only motor scooters.\n\nWe can see that having this information helps us to determine which explanation is correct.\n\nThe correct answer is (E).",

        "question": "The findings of recent research indicate that prolonged exposure to radiation from computer monitors diminishes mental capacity. The evidence cited in the study shows that workers who spend in excess of 20 hours per week directly in front of a computer monitor exhibit an average 12% reduction in cognitive abilities after 15 years in the same occupation.\n\nThe response to which of the following questions would be most helpful in evaluating the reasoning presented in the survey?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "This is a “Useful to Evaluate” question, which borrows many tactics from traditional Strengthen/Weaken questions. (The leverage phrase in the question stem, “which… would be most helpful in evaluating…” clearly indicates this question type.) With Useful to Evaluate questions, \"Minding the Gap\" is critical. The correct answer will either plug the gap (Strengthen) or explode the gap (Weaken). Trap answers will not address the logical gap.\n\nThe primary logical gap in this question is the disconnect between the data and the conclusion. While the data tells us that workers who spend 20+ hours in front of a computer monitor exhibit a 12% reduction in cognitive abilities after 15 years, we don’t know if that 12% reduction is actually caused by the exposure or if it might be caused by something else during those 15 years. (For example, what if most people who sit at a job for 15 years see a much greater decline in cognitive ability? A mere 12% reduction could actually show that sitting in front of computer monitors keep your brain relatively sharp! Alternatively, what if it isn’t the radiation that causes the decline; instead, sitting in one position for 15 years is what actually causes it?) We need to find the answer choice that addresses this gap in some way.\n\nAnswer choice A “moves the goalposts” on the reader, getting the reader to think that the reversibility (or permanency) of the damage matters. This introduces an emotional, human component to the story, but one that isn’t related to the logical gap. A is a trap answer.\n\nAnswer choice B traps those who misunderstand what the problem is asking. While questioning the 15-year period might be interesting if someone is evaluating the study as a whole, the question stem explicitly asks us to identify the question that can best help us evaluate the specific reasoning presented. Answer choice B does not address the logical gap between the data and the conclusion.\n\nAt first glance, answer choice C looks like it helps us to compare the rates of cognitive decline across a spectrum of various occupational tasks. However, answer choice C is a Yes/No question that doesn’t really help us much: if the answer is “No”, then it appears that occupational tasks might not determine cognitive decline. But if we answer “Yes”, then we only know that there .\n\nAnswer choice D doesn’t mind the logical gap. In fact, the problem states that the “average” cognitive decline was 12%. This data point implies that either (1) all of the participants somehow had the exact same 12% drop, or (2) some people were above and others were below the 12% average. That is how “average” works. It is very likely that the data was spread around the 12% average, so D tells us very little. And D certainly doesn’t address the lack of clear causal link between monitor exposure and cognitive decline.\n\nAnswer choice E gives us a strong comparative that can help us prove (or disprove) a potential causal link. The answer to the question in this answer choice would give us a measurable number against which we can compare the 12% cognitive decline. Whether the cognitive decline rate of the average worker is higher than, lower than, or equal to the measured 12% decline, such data could give us strong leverage to evaluate the reasoning in the argument. </span>",

        "question": "Which of the following best completes the passage below?\n\nA study was recently conducted to determine whether power lines caused some kind of negative health effects. The researchers surveyed everyone living within 200 meters of highvoltage power lines over a 15-year period and looked for statistically significant increases in rates of over 1000 ailments. The study found that the incidence of childhood leukaemia was four times higher among those who lived closest to the power lines. However, this statistic by itself should not be a cause for alarm, because__________________________. \n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Let's work with an easier example: if we roll one die one time, our chances of getting a 3 are relatively low (~17%). If we roll two dice one time, our chances of getting at least one 3 are significantly higher (~30%). If we roll ten dice one time, our chances of getting at least one 3 are pretty good (~84%). If we roll a hundred dice one time, we're extremely likely to get at least one 3 (&gt;99.99%). So even though the probability of getting a 3 on any one die isn't super high, the more dice we roll, the more likely at least one of the dice will give us a 3.\n\nBringing it back to this problem: it's not very likely that the survey is going to give us a false result for any one ailment. However, we did test  of them. So even though the probability of getting an incorrect statistic for any one ailment is low, the more statistics we test, the more likely at least one of them will give us a false result. In other words, because we tested so many ailments, there's a pretty high likelihood that the result for one of the ailments is false — that an ailment shows a statistically significant difference near power lines vs. away from power lines when it actually shouldn't. We only saw one statistically significant difference (in childhood leukemia), so it's likely to be that false result.",

Using this we can conclude that lack of play leads to lack of skills essential for successful operation during adult years\n\n\nThis option basically states the main point of the passage:\nb.1. The words  is describing the type of play\nb.2. The words  means survival skills\nCombine both the points and what we get is that playing during the young years develops survival skills that become essential during adult years.\n\n\nIf one is short on time then one can take a best guess by observing that the passage talks about mammals and hence options that support the evidence should also talk about mammals. If we just glance over the options then B talks about non-mammals whereas all other options talk about mammals. One can mark B and move on.\n\nAns -",

        "question": "Transportation expenses accounted for a large portion of the total dollar amount spent on trips for pleasure by residents of the United States in 1997, and about half of the total dollar amount spent on the transportation was airfare. However, the large majority of United States residents who took trips for pleasure in 1997 did not travel by airplane but used other means of transportation.\n\nIf the statements above are true, which of the following must also be true about United States residents who took trips for pleasure in 1997?\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "This is an inference question, and we don't have a nice conclusion to use as a starting point. Instead, let's make sure we clearly understand the given information, paying attention to little details and modifiers as we go:\n\n portion of the total dollar amount spent on trips for pleasure by residents of the United States in 1997.\" This statement has lots of important details, so don't skim over them. TE accounted for a LARGE portion, but we don't know how large. We cannot say that TE accounted for the LARGEST portion or even for MOST of the total. Also, keep in mind that we are only talking about trips for pleasure by US residents. people like Pepsi and the  of people like Pepsi. But does a  majority prefer Pepsi? Not in this case because the difference is very small. If 800 people like Coke and 200 like Pepsi, then we could say that the large majority of people surveyed like Coke. Again, there really isn't any absolute rule for the numerical cutoff, but if we want to use \"large majority\", there should be a significant difference. So this statement tells us that a lot more people did NOT travel by airplane but used other means of transportation.\nIf the statements above are true, which of the following must also be true about United States residents who took trips for pleasure in 1997?\n\nThe passage doesn't say anything about WHY people chose air travel or other means of transportation. In fact, the numbers seem to suggest that those who traveled by airplane had HIGHER average TE than people who did not travel by airplane. Flying may have been the more expensive option, but people may have chosen it because, for example, it was much faster, more convenient, more comfortable, etc. Choice (A) can be eliminated.\n\nAgain, the passage doesn't say anything about WHY people chose certain means of transportation. It is certainly possible that several modes of transportation were  and people chose to fly for a variety of reasons (speed, convenience, comfort, etc). Choice (B) is not necessarily true and can be eliminated.  \n\nThe problem with choice (C) is the \"per mile traveled\" part. Those who traveled by airplane may have spent more IN TOTAL on transportation than did those who used other means of transportation, but that does not necessarily mean they spent more PER MILE. For example, those who chose to fly may have traveled thousands of miles on average to reach their destinations while those who did not fly may have traveled only tens or hundreds of miles on average. We cannot infer that this is true, so eliminate (C).\n\n\nAbout half of the TE was spent on airfare and about half of the TE was spent on other transportation costs (i.e. cars/fuel, buses, trains, etc.). But a LARGE MAJORITY of the people who took trips for pleasure did NOT travel by airplane. How could this be true?\n\nWe are told that the amount spent on airfare was about the  as the amount spent on other transportation costs. So picture two equal bars on a bar graph. If the number of people traveling by airplane was about the same as the number of people using other means of transportation, then we would divide the bars by roughly the same number to get the average TE for both groups. But we know that the number of people who did NOT travel by plane was much higher than the number who did travel by plane (the large majority did not travel by airplane). That means we have to divide the non-airfare bar by a much HIGHER number than the airfare bar to get the average TE for each group. That means that the average TE would be much higher for the airfare group (because we divided by a smaller number). Choice (D) has to be true, so keep this one.\n\nThe amount that those who traveled by airplane spent on other means of transportation (i.e. rental cars, etc.) may have only been a small fraction of what they spent on airfare. Most of the non-airfare TE were likely incurred by the large majority who did NOT travel by airplane. Choice (E) does not have to be true and can be eliminated.\n\nChoice (D) is the only one that  to be true.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

Independent concert promoters often lose money by representing well-known artists. This is not necessarily true per the information provided above. Independent concert promoters have had to increase their guaranteed payments to famous clients. In addition, they have raised their ticket prices resulting in low attendance. These actions could lead to loss of money or maybe not. Hence we can't infer A from the information provided above.\n\nB. The largest independent concert promoter has fewer employees than the smallest publicly traded promoter. This is incorrect and entirely out of scope as far as the information provided above is concerned.\n\nC. Ticket price is the most important determining factor for concert attendance. This is not necessarily true. Increased ticket prices have resulted in low attendance at a number of recent shows, does not mean that it has resulted in low attendance in all recent shows. So, there is a possibility that there are shows with high ticket prices that had high patronage.\n\nD. Future ticket prices for well-known artists will continue to increase. Not necessarily. The ticket price is only increased to offset the guaranteed payments to well-known artists. This does not mean that future ticket prices for well-known artists will automatically increase. If the guaranteed payments remain the same, there would be no justification for an increase in ticket price.\n\nE. The contracts between concert promoters and artists are not always based solely on revenue generated by ticket sales. This is the only one left and the language is not extreme. This is true.

He has a counterpoint. He states that at least one segment supports both Q and R.\n\nWhat does Salim counter? He counters that the ‘then’ case of Mashika’s conditional does not hold.\n\nMashika: If A happens, then B happens.\n\nSalim: But B hasn’t happened. \n\n(Salim indicates that A hasn’t happened.)\n\nWe are looking for something that must be true based on the assertions made by the two guys.\n\nSalim asserts that the consequence that Mashika mentions in her conditional is actually not the case. Thus, it can be inferred that the ‘if condition’ Mashika put forth does not hold. i.e. not all P-supporting segments also support Q. There could, of course, be other inferences as well.\n\n\nIf we’re given a conditional: If A occurs then B occurs\n\nIf A occurs, we can infer that B also occurs\n\nIf B does not occur, we can infer that A did not occur\n\nIf B occurs, we cannot infer that A occurred. i.e., A may or may not occur.\n\nIf A does not occur, we cannot infer that B will not occur. i.e., B may or may not occur.\n\nThis question also deals with the concept of negation.\n\nThe ‘if condition’ says: all segments that support P also support Q. To say that the condition does not hold, we just need to go as far as to show that the statement is not true. We do not need to go the opposite extreme.\n\nStatement: All segments that support P also support Q\n\nThe statement is false implies: Not all segments that support P also support Q.

        "question": "A ten-year comparison between Brazilian and Canadian crops showed that Brazilian yields are 68% of Canadian yields when compared on the basis of per planted acre. However, Brazilian yields are 115% of Canadian yields when measured per agricultural acre.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following can most reliably be inferred about Brazilian and Canadian agriculture over this time period?\n\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "It's a confusingly worded question, but it tests something many CR questions test: do you confuse ratios/percentages with actual numbers. You can rule out C and E instantly, since the stem only talks about ratios, and C and E talk about actual numbers. You can also rule out D without even reading the stem, since if D is true, then A would also need to be true (D is a special case of A). There cannot be 2 correct answers to a GMAT question, so D cannot be right. So if you can see that B is not a valid inference, you can be sure A is right.\n\nBut we can see why A is correct. The key distinction in the question is between \"planted acres\" and \"agricultural acres\". I think we're meant to interpret \"planted acres\" as land used specifically for crops, and \"agricultural acres\" as all land available - some of that land will be used for crops, but some might be used for grazing cattle or some other purpose.\n\nThe stem tells us that \"Brazilian yields are 68% of Canadian yields per planted acre.\" That means: for each acre they use for planting, Canada gets more crops. So if Brazil and Canada were each planting on an exactly equal proportion of their agricultural land, Canada would get a higher yield per acre, because they're more efficient at farming. But we learn in the second sentence that is not the case. When you look at all land, planted or not, Brazil gets a higher yield per acre. So Brazil must be planting on more of its land than Canada is to compensate for their lower efficiency per acre planted. That's what A says.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This question exhibits a commonly-repeated flaw on the LSAT: Disproof of an  being taken as disproof of that argument’s . Just because an argument is bad doesn’t mean that the argument’s conclusion can’t still be correct.\n\nAn example of this flawed thinking would be, “The cops planted the bloody glove, therefore OJ did not actually commit the crime.” I agree that the cops ruined their case against OJ through their misconduct, and I think it’s right that OJ therefore walks, because we need to discourage future police misconduct. But the fact that some of the evidence was shown to be faulty does not prove that OJ didn’t commit the crime. A rock-solid alibi would  he didn’t do it. A videotape of someone else doing the crime would prove he didn’t do it. Unfortunately for OJ, he doesn’t have either of these, and all other evidence suggests he is insane. The most likely scenario seems to be that the cops are crooked, the prosecutors were weak, and OJ, nevertheless, did actually do it. \n\nAnother example of this concept would be something like, “It’s raining outside, therefore San Francisco is in California.” This argument is horrible. The only premise (“it’s raining outside”) has nothing to do with the conclusion. But a terrible argument doesn’t disprove its own conclusion: the conclusion of the argument can still be correct.\n\nA) I don’t think the argument does this, partially because I don’t even know what it means. I’m hoping to find something that I can understand, and that matches my predicted flaw.\n\nB) Yep. This is a good description of the flaw of taking disproof of  to mean disproof of that argument’s conclusion, so it’s almost certainly the correct answer.\n\nC) What? This is nonsensical. There can be all sorts of good reasons for disbelieving a true statement. Example: If you were OJ’s friend, but you didn’t know he was completely crazy, then maybe you wouldn’t believe the prosecutor when he told you OJ did it, even though in retrospect you’d have to agree that he obviously did it. Anyway B was exactly what I predicted, so I don’t need to waste any more time on C.\n\nD) Is it even a  that people’s perception of their importance changed from century to century? I’m not sure it is. Anyway this isn’t what I was looking for. B is still the leader.\n\nE) Again, I’m not sure this is a fact we were provided. And I’m also not sure it’s relevant.\n\nOur answer is B.\n\nThis was a relatively easy question if you’ve seen the flaw a few times, but could be a very difficult question if you haven’t seen it before. The answer choices here are confusing, so if you don’t have an idea what you’re looking for you’re probably in really big trouble.

At the same time, there could be many other factors that underlie the difference in budget deficits. So, the cause of the difference may not be that one province allows union bargaining whereas the other doesn't.\n\n\n\nEven this outcome could be the result of many factors other than allowing union bargaining.\n\nIn general, the fact that a province allows union bargaining and has a lower deficit doesn't necessarily mean that the first is the cause of the second.\n\nSo, we can see that, having used that evidence to support the conclusion, the argument is vulnerable to the criticism that \"It fails to adequately address the possibility that many factors affect provincial budget deficits.\"\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThis choice is incorrect because the argument simply doesn't do what it describes.\n\nAfter all, the argument doesn't make a similar claim about the other province: it doesn't make the claim that a measure to allow union bargaining in the other province probably will, in the future, reduce the other provinces's deficit.\n\nAlso, the argument doesn't confuse any claims with each other.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is counterfactual.\n\nAfter all, the argument actually says, \"The province immediately north of ours allows such union bargaining, and its budget deficit is ... lower than it was before the province allowed union bargaining.\"\n\nThe stated fact that the budget deficit of province immediately to the north is lower than it was before the province allowed union bargaining means that the budget deficit of province immediately to the north was higher before it allowed union bargaining.\n\nSo, the argument clearly does not overlook \"the possibility that the budget deficit of the province immediately to the north was higher before that province allowed the union bargaining.\"\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe argument does not involve the conclusion or require the assumption that \"if the measure reduces the budget deficit, then it will not increase wages of government employees.\"\n\nAfter all, the argument works as long as the measure would reduce the deficit, regardless of what else goes on.\n\nSo, it doesn't take the idea mentioned by this choice for granted since it doesn't involve or rely on that idea.\n\nEliminate.\n \n\n\nThis choice is incorrect because the argument simply doesn't do what it describes.\n\nAfter all, the argument doesn't involve any \"value judgment that the measure should be enacted.\" Rather, it simply makes a claim about the measure's likely consequences without getting into any value judgment.\n\nEliminate.\n\n A­",

        "question": "In a poll of a representative sample of a province’s residents, the provincial capital was the city most often selected as the best place to live in that province. Since the capital is also the largest of that province’s many cities, the poll shows that most residents of that province generally prefer life in large cities to life in small cities.\n\nThe argument is most vulnerable to the criticism that it\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "The difficulty here is that there could be a lot of different reasons for saying that the argument is flawed. The argument doesn’t give us enough information to justify its conclusion.\n\nThe “representative” sample polled people in a certain province, asking them where the best place to live is . They weren’t asked where they’d like to live in the whole world, just in their own province. All we know about the responses is that the “most commonly selected” place is the capital city of the province, which also happens to be the biggest city in the province. All of this is fact.\n\nThe argument goes off the rails, as always, when it reaches the conclusion: “Most residents of the province generally prefer life in large cities to life in small cities.” That’s not really justified by the facts. Here’s why:\n\n1) It’s possible that all the small cities in  are garbage. The fact that people picked the big city in their province doesn’t mean that they like big cities . Maybe the small cities in their province suck.\n\n2) Similarly, it’s possible that the big city in their province is super-awesome. Maybe it’s Vancouver, which is totally amazing. Maybe these people only actually like this  big city, and would hate other big cities. If this were true, then people would not  prefer big cities, just this one in particular.\n\n3) There’s a subtle disconnect between the poll question, “Where is the best place to live?” and the conclusion, “Most residents prefer to live in big cities.” People could objectively say, “Yes, big cities are the best place to live,” to a pollster, but actually prefer to live in a small city. “Big cities are so exciting! Oh, but me myself? No, I could never live there, I’m not a big city type of person.” This is really a quibble though. I’m not sure how reasonable this objection is. Common sense might say, “That’s bullshit. People pretty much answer the question with where  would like to live.”\n\n4) We don’t even know if the capital city got a majority of the votes. Yes, it was the “most commonly selected.” But that doesn’t mean that it got 51 percent of the vote. It’s possible that the capital city was the leading single answer, with 12 percent of total residents. It’s possible that the remaining 88 percent of the populace voted for a variety of **** little small towns, with no town reaching over 11 percent of the vote. If this were the case, then 12 percent would have expressed a preference for living in a big city, while 88 percent would have expressed exactly the opposite. If that’s the case, then the conclusion clearly fails.\n\nAny of the above could be the correct answer, which makes for a tough question. We have to pick the answer choice that 1) describes something that the argument actually did, and 2) provides a good reason for saying, “Your conclusion is therefore bullshit.”\n\nA) Other people are simply not relevant. The argument’s premises and conclusion were solely about residents of  province.\n\nB) Same explanation as A.\n\nC) No, this answer misstates the facts. People weren't asked about \"their preferences among cities.\" They were specifically asked to name the best place to live.\n\nD) Even if this is true, the argument is unchanged. The capital city won the poll. Why do we care why the small city folks prefer small cities?\n\nE) Yep. This is our fourth objection above. If the 12 percent vs. 88 percent scenario is true, then the conclusion is totally bogus. This is the best answer to a very tough question.\n\nOur answer is E.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "Economist: In Nation X, the number of unsold homes on the market recently reached a twenty-year high. The last time the number of unsold homes was that high, a severe economic recession soon followed. Therefore, the nation's economy is almost certainly about to suffer another severe recession.\n\nThe economist's reasoning is most vulnerable to criticism on which of the following grounds?\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The economist concludes the following:\n\n\n\nThe conclusion is supported by the following premises:\n\n\n\nWe see that the economist has reasoned that, since in the past one event, \"severe recession,\" followed another, \"unsold homes ... reached a twenty-year high,\" a severe recession will \"almost certainly\" soon occur because the number of unsold homes has reached the same high. In other words, the economist has observed a pattern and expects the pattern to repeat.\n\nSince the question asks us to find the choice that present grounds on which \"the economist's reasoning is most vulnerable to criticism,\" the correct answer must point out a flaw in the argument.\n\n\n\nThe argument doesn't do what this choice describes. Rather the economist keeps the two claims separate and concludes that the claim about unsold homes supports the claim about a recession.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe argument does not mention this possibility, but even though the argument doesn't mention it, the argument still works.\n\nAfter all, even if it is the case that a severe recession can cause there to be an unusually large number of unsold homes, it could still be the case that the fact that there are an unusually large number of unsold homes indicates that a recession is about to occur.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nIt's true that the economist does not mention the possibility presented by this choice. At the same time, that the economist does not mention that possibility is not a flaw in the argument. Here's why.\n\nThe economist's reasoning is basically that \"an unusually large number of unsold homes on the market\" will be followed by a \"severe recession.\"\n\nSo, unsold homes --&gt; recession. \n\nNow, notice that unsold homes --&gt; recession could be true even if severe economic recessions have occurred when there were not an unusually large number of unsold homes on the market.\n\nAfter all, it could be that recessions occur in a variety of ways; it could be that some recessions follow an unusually large number of unsold homes on the market while other recessions follow a fall in the stock market or an increase in interest rates.\n\nIn that case, it would be true that severe economic recessions have occurred when there were not an unusually large number of unsold homes on the market, and at the same time, it could still be true that the current unusually large number of unsold homes on the market will be followed by a severe recession.\n\nIn other words, the economist doesn't say that an unusually large number of unsold homes on the market is necessary for a recession to occur. Rather, the economist's point is that an unusually large number of unsold homes on the market is simply a sign that a recession will occur.\n\nSo, the argument still works even if other severe economic recessions in Nation X have occurred when there were not an unusually large number of unsold homes on the market.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nWe see that the economist's conclusion that \"the nation's economy is almost certainly about to suffer another severe recession\" is based solely on the fact that, previously, when there were an unusually large number of unsold homes on the market, there was a recession.\n\nIn supporting the conclusion in that way, the economist is assuming that there is a relationship, such as a causal one, between there being an unusually large number of unsold homes on the market and a recession. In doing so, the economist has failed to address the possibility that the past sequence of events, unsold homes then recession, occurred only by coincidence and that, in that case, the fact that there are an unusually large number of unsold homes currently would not support the conclusion that there will be a recession.\n\nSo, the argument is flawed because it fails to address that possibility.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThis choice may seem correct because we may get the impression that the argument fails to address the possibility that the causation is reversed and that a recession causes homes to remain on the market rather than that homes remaining unsold leads to a recession.\n\nSo, why isn't this choice correct?\n\nThe reason is that the scenario doesn't involve an unusually large number of unsold homes on the market and a recession occurring AT THE SAME TIME. Rather, the scenario involves an unusually large number of unsold homes on the market existing BEFORE a recession occurs.\n\nSo, since the large number of unsold homes exists before the recession occurs, we know that the recession did not cause the large number of unsold homes. After all, a recession would not cause something that happened before the recession.                                                                                              \n\nSo, while the argument does not address the possibility that a severe economic recession may cause homes to remain on the market unsold, that it does not address it is not a flaw.\n\nEliminate.\n\nThe correct answer is",

So how do you know that it wasn’t a different adaptation to the ice ages that made us what we are? You seem to have assumed that if polar bear brains didn’t adapt to ice ages, then human brains couldn’t have adapted either. That seems silly, seeing as how humans are very different from polar bears.”\n\nA) This is describing the classic sufficient vs. necessary flaw, which I didn’t spot in the argument. I’m very highly attuned to this flaw, because it is so common. So if I didn’t spot it when I read the argument, then I am almost sure it isn’t there.\n\nB) Yep. Because polar bears didn’t change, therefore humans couldn’t have changed? That’s bullshit! Which makes this a great answer.\n\nC) The problem with this answer is that it’s saying “necessary” instead of “sufficient.” The argument says ice ages weren’t sufficient to change polar bear brains, therefore ice ages weren’t sufficient to change human brains either. This answer says ice ages were necessary to change one species, but might not be necessary for other species. That’s different… the argument isn’t talking about necessary conditions.\n\nD) Huh?

Given this trend, there will likely be no women getting married for the first time by 2050!\n\nWhich of the following, if true, exposes a flaw in the sociologist’s reasoning?\n\n",
        "answer": "Edited the question.",
        "explanation": "I love your comment about choice A...it certainly is the only thing left standing when you eliminate the obviously wrong answers.  It's a deceptively effective answer, though.  Choice A states that that average age has increased DRAMATICALLY over the past 20 years.  The statistics presented in the argument show that the marriage rate has decreased dramatically from 1962 to 2012 and the author concludes that if the trend continues no women will be getting married by 2050.  The flaw in the argument is that we haven't looked at how changes in the average age of marriage might impact the current marriage rate.  If 20 years ago the average age of marriage was 20 (I'm making this number up but it's somewhat based on the \"dramatic\" increase cited in choice A) and now the average age of marriage is 40, you have a lot of woman who haven't decided to not get married, they just decided to postpone marriage.  That would lead to a large group of women who are in the \"pending marriage\" state and we would need to wait for another 20 years to see if the marriage rate stabilizes (assuming no more dramatic increases in the marriage age).\n\nHere is a comparison that may help to illustrate this phenomenon.  Let's say I'm watching people walking out of a subway station.  I'm counting people per minute and I'm at 40 people per minute for the first 20 minutes, then for the next 10 minutes the number slows to 10 people per minute.  I conclude that the flow is slowing and pretty soon no one will be walking by.  What really happened (in my made up world) is that most of the trains were delayed through some malfunction of the train system.  These people will walk by eventually, they've just been delayed.  The train delay can be compared with the \"marriage delay\", or the increase in the average age of marriage.  Those marriages very well may still happen, they just may be delayed.\n\nKW\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n |  |",

Additionally, please be extra careful when you see numbers/percentages/proportions in CR questions; often, the key lies in the numbers.\n\nA. Trap. The argument is concerned with juvenile literacy “rate” per 100 adolescents; so, the change in juvenile population density, meaning population per unit area, is just additional consideration and has no bearing on the argument. Because this answer choice does not indicate the information failing to account for which leads to a flaw in the argument, this answer choice is incorrect.\n\n When the literacy rates in two cities are compared, a greater literacy rate increase in one city over a period of time leads to greater literacy in that city if the two cities had a similar literacy rate at the beginning of the period; in other words, without comparing the original juvenile literacy rates in Keating and Nickleby three years ago, no comparison between their literacy rates “now” can be obtained based on the increase in the literacy rate in the last three years; the argument fails to consider the piece of information mentioned in this answer choice and is thus flawed. Because this answer choice indicates the information failing to account for which leads to a flaw in the argument, this answer choice is correct.\n\nC. Trap. The argument considers the increase in literacy rate per 100 adolescents in Keating and Nickleby over three years, suggesting that the change in the ratio of literate to illiterate juveniles in the two cities is considered in the argument.

        "question": "Since 1978, the Hawaiian green turtle has been listed among endangered species. In the nineteenth century and in the early part of the twentieth century, the Hawaiian green turtle was considered a delicacy and was frequently caught for its value as a luxury food item. Its shell and other nonedible features were also considered valuable on the open market. Today the green turtle is heavily protected, and there are strict laws against capturing or harming the large turtles. The green turtles remain on the endangered species list, however, and there are signs that the green turtle population is not increasing as quickly as had been hoped.\n\nWhich of the following best explains the anomaly of the ongoing diminishment of the green turtle population in spite of the endangered species status?\n\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In this question, the student is given information about the Hawaiian green turtle and asked to identify the answer choice that best explains the anomaly between the endangered species status of the green turtle (which should protect it from species diminishment) and the actual species diminishment that continues to occur. The passage contains information about the history of the Hawaiian green turtle, suggesting that the Hawaiian green turtle is well protected under its endangered species status. As a result, there is no clear information in the passage itself to indicate a reason for the ongoing diminishment of the species, so the student must consider each of the answer choices in turn to see if it suffices to explain the anomaly. This makes question 4 somewhat more challenging, and the student must pay careful attention to each answer choice to see if it makes sense within the context of the information that is provided.\n\n\n\nC If there are tumors attacking the species and targeting the younger turtles, it is clearly arguable that the younger turtles are dying off and, thus, that the turtle population is not increasing in spite of endangered species protection. Put another way: if the tumors are attacking the younger turtles, it means that there is less chance for reproduction and less opportunity for the turtle population to grow. Answer choice (C) is correct.\n\n\n\nA Answer choice (A) provides an interesting piece of information: the Hawaiian green turtle is omnivorous but has recently begun to live as a vegetarian due to available food. A closer look, however, shows that this answer choice does not provide enough information to explain the anomaly. If the turtles are living as vegetarians, they might still be getting enough to eat. And if they are omnivorous, they should be able to live as vegetarians without it creating mass starvation among them. Because answer choice (A) does not contain the suggestion that there is a shortage of vegetation for the turtles to eat, it is insufficient and cannot be correct.\n\nB Answer choice (B) also contains interesting information, but it does not provide enough detail to explain sufficiently the diminishment of the Hawaiian green turtle population. There is no information about a shorter life span among the female turtles, nor is there any information about their range of reproduction age (i.e., are they dying while they are still in their reproductive years). As a result, answer choice (B) cannot be correct.\n\nD Answer choice (D) contains no explanation about why the changes in ocean currents from global warming have contributed to a decrease in the Hawaiian green turtle population. Without the further details, answer choice (D) contains no context and simply offers information that does little to explain the anomaly. This answer choice is incorrect and may be eliminated.\n\nE At first glance, answer choice (E) does provide information that could explain the diminishment of the Hawaiian green turtle population: ghost crabs are consuming the hatchlings at the nesting site in the French Frigate Shoals. Upon a closer look, however, there is information to indicate that the ghost crab is a “traditional” predator of the green turtle hatchlings, so this does nothing to explain the more recent reduction of the green turtle population. Answer choice (E) is incorrect.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

Critics contend these offices should close, since they are a waste of public money.

The counter-argument that the critics make is based on the support that the office staff provides. The office staff defends the statement made by the critics in line 2 stating that the offices should close as they are a waste of public money. In response to this statement, the office staff brings forth their position stating that the value of advice that they give to the farmers far exceeds the cost of maintaining those offices.

Now, what that word extends to is up for debate: the entire argument, the premises, or just one premise. Regardless, she then draws attention to  and an apparent  in buoyancy that is conferred by our subcutaneous fat.\n\nHow can we summarize her response in relation to what David says?\n\n.? Lynn neither mentions others by name nor suggests their presence through a word such as  or . It does seem clear that these new facts run counter to the ones David used to establish his claim, but evidence on its own does not form a counterargument. Now, if you are conservative like me, you might hang on to this option while you searched for one that was less objectionable, but this is a middle-of-the-road answer, probably not what we want in the end.\n\n., in fact, evolve from an aquatic ancestor, we cannot say that the information Lynn brings up . Again, there are more facts to consider, but the jury is still out on the verdict. Watch out for overreaching language.\n\n by drawing upon comparisons.... The overall context of her lines provides no indication that she agreed with the original claim but then pulled an about-face.

In all, this should be an easy elimination, given what we have seen up to this point.\n\n. may apply to, as I wrote above, but it seems reasonable to infer that it covers the information David used to support his argument, since Lynn then provides information on the same general topic.

Lynn brings up points, nothing more.\n\nBetween (A) and (E), there is no contest. The beginning of (A) looks worse than its counterpart: . To what extent does Lynn agree with David? It is much safer to say that she acknowledges something in his argument. And whereas we had to come to terms with  before, now we have a clearcut lack of a counterargument in (E), as detailed above. (E) is the better option, so that is why we should choose it.\n\nNote that these \"Method of Reasoning\" questions share certain labeling characteristics with boldface questions.

However, the lack of evidence about Bosch's membership in the Brethren does not, on its own, necessarily prove that Fraenger's assertion is false. It only casts doubt on it. To guarantee falsity, a direct contradiction or proof would be needed, which is not provided here.\n\n\n\nThis option is incorrect because the statement about the lack of evidence regarding Bosch's membership in the Brethren does not support the claim that he was a member of a mainstream church. The absence of evidence for one claim (membership in the Brethren) does not automatically support another claim (membership in a mainstream church) without additional evidence or reasoning.\n\n\n\nThis option is incorrect because the statement does not specifically question Fraenger's credibility. Instead, it challenges the sufficiency of the evidence that Fraenger presents. It’s more about the adequacy of the evidence for Fraenger’s hypothesis rather than questioning his personal credibility or integrity.\n\n\n\nThis option is correct because the statement highlights the lack of evidence for Bosch's membership in the Brethren, which questions the sufficiency of Fraenger's evidence for his hypothesis. By pointing out that there is no evidence for this claim, the argument suggests that Fraenger’s hypothesis might not be well-supported, thus casting doubt on it.\n\n\n\nThis option is incorrect because the statement about the lack of evidence for Bosch's membership in the Brethren does not directly address the explanation for Bosch's choice of subject matter. It primarily serves to question the validity of Fraenger’s specific hypothesis rather than addressing the overall explanation for Bosch’s artistic choices.\n\nIn summary, the best fit is (D) because it focuses on the role of the evidence in evaluating the validity of Fraenger's hypothesis.­",

        "question": "Due to high jet fuel costs, airline carriers are looking for new ways to increase revenues and thereby counteract declining profits. Airline A has proposed increasing the number of passengers that can fit on its airplanes by creating several standing room only \"seats\" in which passengers would be propped against a padded backboard and held in place with a harness. This proposal, since it relates to passenger safety, cannot be implemented without prior approval by the Federal Aviation Administration. \n\nThe above statements, if true, indicate that Airline A has made which of the following conclusions? \n\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Only two pieces of information are given about Airline A's standing room \"seats\" proposal. First, that it is geared toward increasing revenue in order to counteract declining profits. And second, that, since the proposal relates to passenger safety, it must be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. Airline A must have concluded that the cost of implementation of its proposal is less than the revenue that the new seats will generate.\n\n Since Airline A knows that its proposal would have to comply with safety standards, it must have concluded that the cost of compliance is worth it. In other words, the only way for Airline A to achieve its goal of increasing profit is to implement ideas that will generate more revenue than they cost. Airline A must therefore have concluded that the standing room only \"seats\" meet this criteria.\n\n(B) The statements in the passage imply nothing about whether Airline A believes that the Federal Aviation Administration will approve the proposal. Although Airline A must believe that the proposal has a chance of being approved (otherwise it's unlikely to have proposed it), the airline might have proposed its specific plan knowing that it might not be approved or, that it might have to be changed in certain ways.\n\n(C) Airline A's goal is simply to \"counteract declining profits\" caused by the high cost of jet fuel. This does not mean, however, that the proposal must fully mitigate the cost of jet fuel. As long as the proposal increases revenue without a corollary increase in cost, it will in some way (even if it's relatively small) counteract declining profits.\n\n(D) The passage does not mention any other ways that Airline A has considered increasing revenue. Therefore, it is impossible to conclude anything about Airline A's perception of its standing room \"seats\" proposal to any other ideas.\n\n(E) The statements in the passage do not address Airline A's view regarding the safety of the standing room only \"seats\". It is very possible that Airline A views its proposal as safe and sees no conflict between passenger safety and increasing revenue, much less that it has made any determination about the relative importance of these two issues.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

People who use it avoid indoor smoke inhalation, fire hazards, and injuries from gathering firewood. They also have environmental benefits such as reducing deforestation, lowering energy costs, and reducing CO2 emissions. The solar cooker is a simple solution to a host of problems in the developing world.\n\nZola: While I agree with your arguments, I disagree with your conclusion. Solar cookers have all of those benefits. Unfortunately, it takes a long time for them to bring water to a boil—usually between two and three hours—and they require ample sunlight, which is not always available in the rainy season. In practice, they are not a perfect solution by far.\n\nZola responds to Jason’s argument using which one of the following argumentative techniques?\n\n",

The question asks that you describe what argumentative method Zola uses to respond to Jason.\n\n\nReading their arguments, you discover that Zola argues that the long cooking time and the ample sunlight necessary to operate the solar cooker are problems, meaning that the solar cooker is not such a perfect answer to “a host of problems in developing nations.” She sees the arguments on which the conclusion is based as sound and logical, but she feels the conclusion doesn’t take other factors into account.\n\n\nYou will look for something similar in your answer options.\n\n\nZola actually agrees with Jason’s arguments and does not believe them to be “fallacious,” so answer A cannot be correct. While Zola disagrees with Jason’s conclusion, her problem is specific to the cooker, not his insufficient definition of the problems in developing nations, so answer B cannot be correct. Answer C has the same problem as answer A. She does not disagree with his arguments or their basis. With answer D, Zola is not reinterpreting anything, so this answer cannot be correct. Zola gives caveats that weaken several of Jason’s assumptions, and this is what you find in answer E.

This could certainly explain an increase in property values because better schools and better downtown can make it more desirable to live there, but we don't know when this occurred and there are no other connecting facts, so its relevance is questionable. \nE. This could maybe explain an increase in property values because it likely means better and higher paying jobs in the area, which increases demand and the supply of money, but we don't know when this occurred and there are no other connecting facts, so its relevance is questionable. \n\nB, D, and E are all acceptable answers and there are no connecting facts to logically distinguish one as a more likely cause than the others, so this is a terrible question IMO.\n\nAgain, I think the author wanted the answer to have to connect the two facts, making B the most relevant, but there's nothing in the question to suggest having to do that.

        "question": "For a ten-month period, the total monthly sales of new cars within the country of Calistan remained constant. During this period the monthly sales of new cars manufactured by Marvel Automobile Company doubled, and its share of the new car market within Calistan increased correspondingly. At the end of this period, emission standards were imposed on new cars sold within Calistan. During the three months following this imposition, Marvel Automobile Company’s share of the Calistan market declined substantially even though its monthly sales within Calistan remained constant at the level reached in the last month of the ten-month period. \n\nIf the statements above are true, which one of the following CANNOT be true? \n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": ": \n\n \n\nLet us first review the facts given in the stimulus:  For a ten-month period, the total monthly sales of new cars within the country of Calistan remained constant. The wording of this statement should alert you that numbers and percentages in the form of market share (“monthly sales...remained constant”) may be an issue in this problem. Note that the statement is a simple fact; no explanation is given for why the total sales stayed constant.  During this period the monthly sales of new cars manufactured by Marvel Automobile Company doubled, and its share of the new car market within Calistan increased correspondingly. If total monthly sales of new cars remains constant and Marvel’s sales doubled, then Marvel’s share of the new car market must also have doubled. Again, no explanation for Marvel’s increase is given; the increase is just stated as a fact.  At the end of this period, emission standards were imposed on new cars sold within Calistan. Imposing new emission standards serves as a chronology marker in this stimulus. Again, no explanation is given for why the new standards were imposed.  During the three months following this imposition, Marvel Automobile Company’s share of the Calistan market declined substantially even though its monthly sales within Calistan remained constant at the level reached in the last month of the ten-month period. This sentence is the key to the stimulus. From a numbers and percentages standpoint, we are given two pieces of related information: during the three months after the emissions standards were imposed, Marvel’s monthly sales of new cars within Calistan remained constant at the pre-standards level, and at the same time Marvel’s share of the market declined. From the discussion in Chapter Seventeen, we know that if sales remain constant but the share represented by those sales decreased, then the overall sales in the market must have increased. For example: \n\n \nMarvel’s Monthly New Car Sales                10                    10 \nTotal Monthly New Car Sales in Calistan    100                 200 \nMarvel’s Market Share                               10%                5%\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

          "If the emission standards had not been imposed, Marvel Automobile Company would have lost an even larger share of the number of new cars sold in Calistan than, in fact, it did. ",
          "A decrease in the total monthly sales of new cars within Calistan will occur if the emission standards remain in effect. ",

        "question": "Many uses have been claimed for hypnosis, from combating drug addiction to overcoming common phobias. A recent experimental study helps illuminate the supposed connection between hypnosis and increased power of recall. A number of subjects listened to a long, unfamiliar piece of instrumental music. Under subsequent hypnosis, half the subjects were asked to recall salient passages from the musical piece and half were asked to describe scenes from \"the film they had just viewed,'' despite their not having just seen a film. The study found that the subjects in the second group were equally confident and detailed in their movie recollections as the subjects in the first group were in their music recollections.\n\nWhich one of the following statements is most supported by the information above?\n",

(They were falsely suggested under hypnosis that they had just watched a film and were asked its details) \n\nResult:\nThe subjects in the second group were equally confident and detailed in their movie recollections as the subjects in the first group were in their music recollections. (inspite of not watching any movie)\n\nWhat can we say? That when the subjects were suggested that they had watched a movie, they believed it and gave details confidently. That the subjects were suggestible when under hypnosis. \n\n(A) Many of the claims made on behalf of hypnosis are overstated.\n\nNot said in the argument. \n\n(B) Hypnosis cannot significantly increase a person's power of recall.\n\nIs the link significant or not, the argument doesn't say. It does seem to apply that hypnosis did increase power of recall. The music was long and unfamiliar but people recounted details confidently. \n\n(C) Recalling events under hypnosis inevitably results in false memories.\n\nThe argument doesn't say that it  results in false memories. Whether the first group recalled correctly or not, we do not know. \n\n(D) What people recall under hypnosis depends to at least some extent on suggestion.\n\nCorrect. What people recall depends on what is suggested to them. When they were suggested that they had watched a movie, they thought that they had and recalled details (of perhaps a movie they had watched at another time). So what they recall depends on what is suggested to them.\n\n(E) Visual memory is enhanced more by hypnosis than is auditory memory.\n\nThe argument doesn't say that visual memory is enhanced more. \n\nAnswer (D)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "Transportation expenses accounted for a large portion of the total dollar amount spent on trips for pleasure by residents of the United States in 1997, and about half of the total dollar amount spent on the transportation was airfare. However, the large majority of United States residents who took trips for pleasure in 1997 did not travel by airplane but used other means of transportation.\n\nIf the statements above are true, which of the following must also be true about United States residents who took trips for pleasure in 1997?\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "This is an inference question, and we don't have a nice conclusion to use as a starting point. Instead, let's make sure we clearly understand the given information, paying attention to little details and modifiers as we go:\n\n portion of the total dollar amount spent on trips for pleasure by residents of the United States in 1997.\" This statement has lots of important details, so don't skim over them. TE accounted for a LARGE portion, but we don't know how large. We cannot say that TE accounted for the LARGEST portion or even for MOST of the total. Also, keep in mind that we are only talking about trips for pleasure by US residents. people like Pepsi and the  of people like Pepsi. But does a  majority prefer Pepsi? Not in this case because the difference is very small. If 800 people like Coke and 200 like Pepsi, then we could say that the large majority of people surveyed like Coke. Again, there really isn't any absolute rule for the numerical cutoff, but if we want to use \"large majority\", there should be a significant difference. So this statement tells us that a lot more people did NOT travel by airplane but used other means of transportation.\nIf the statements above are true, which of the following must also be true about United States residents who took trips for pleasure in 1997?\n\nThe passage doesn't say anything about WHY people chose air travel or other means of transportation. In fact, the numbers seem to suggest that those who traveled by airplane had HIGHER average TE than people who did not travel by airplane. Flying may have been the more expensive option, but people may have chosen it because, for example, it was much faster, more convenient, more comfortable, etc. Choice (A) can be eliminated.\n\nAgain, the passage doesn't say anything about WHY people chose certain means of transportation. It is certainly possible that several modes of transportation were  and people chose to fly for a variety of reasons (speed, convenience, comfort, etc). Choice (B) is not necessarily true and can be eliminated.  \n\nThe problem with choice (C) is the \"per mile traveled\" part. Those who traveled by airplane may have spent more IN TOTAL on transportation than did those who used other means of transportation, but that does not necessarily mean they spent more PER MILE. For example, those who chose to fly may have traveled thousands of miles on average to reach their destinations while those who did not fly may have traveled only tens or hundreds of miles on average. We cannot infer that this is true, so eliminate (C).\n\n\nAbout half of the TE was spent on airfare and about half of the TE was spent on other transportation costs (i.e. cars/fuel, buses, trains, etc.). But a LARGE MAJORITY of the people who took trips for pleasure did NOT travel by airplane. How could this be true?\n\nWe are told that the amount spent on airfare was about the  as the amount spent on other transportation costs. So picture two equal bars on a bar graph. If the number of people traveling by airplane was about the same as the number of people using other means of transportation, then we would divide the bars by roughly the same number to get the average TE for both groups. But we know that the number of people who did NOT travel by plane was much higher than the number who did travel by plane (the large majority did not travel by airplane). That means we have to divide the non-airfare bar by a much HIGHER number than the airfare bar to get the average TE for each group. That means that the average TE would be much higher for the airfare group (because we divided by a smaller number). Choice (D) has to be true, so keep this one.\n\nThe amount that those who traveled by airplane spent on other means of transportation (i.e. rental cars, etc.) may have only been a small fraction of what they spent on airfare. Most of the non-airfare TE were likely incurred by the large majority who did NOT travel by airplane. Choice (E) does not have to be true and can be eliminated.\n\nChoice (D) is the only one that  to be true.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Hey folks! \n\nThis is a very interesting  assumption question with some very important learnings - it \nWith the objective of reducing traffic congestion,\n\n\nThe transportation bureau of City X has made a plan – to encourage people who work in the downtown area of the city to sign a form. By signing this form, a person will be pledging to either carpool (i.e., share a car with other people) or use public transportation (for example – buses, local trains) for the next year. \n\n\nEach person who signs the form i.e., everyone who takes the pledge, will get a coupon for a free meal at any restaurant in the downtown area.\n\n\nThe question stem contains the conclusion. \n\n for the plan to succeed. In other words, we need to find out what  for the conclusion to hold true. So, we are looking for an assumption here.\n\n\n (for example, reduce it from a 100 to a 90). Notice that to achieve this objective, we do not necessarily need a big reduction in traffic congestion (example – say, 70% reduction). Even if the reduction in traffic congestion is tiny (example – say 1% reduction, i.e., 100 to 99), \n\n \n\n? At least some people working downtown contribute at least slightly to the traffic congestion problem in City X.\n At least some of the people who took the pledge will carpool/use public transportation at least some times in the next year.\n\n\n. Does everyone who signs the pledge have to abide by the pledge 100% of the time for the plan to succeed? \nNo. Remember – for the plan to succeed, there only has to be a reduction in traffic congestion – it need not be a big reduction.\nWhat this means is that it is not strictly necessary that 100% of the people who sign the pledge follow the pledge 100% of the time. \n\n\n For example, even if none of the people who work downtown prefer the downtown restaurants (negated option B), some of them may still sign the form and honor the pledge because they care about reducing traffic congestion genuinely. So, the conclusion can hold true even if option B is negated. \nAlso, irrespective of preference, people may use the coupon and avail the free meal (even if I do not prefer the restaurant, I may choose to eat there as the meal is free). Preference does not necessarily translate to action.\n\n\n\n\nIt is even possible that 100% of the traffic congestion caused by people working downtown is caused in non-downtown areas: for example, a situation where all the traffic congestion caused by these people happens on the way to work/on the way back from work, in non-downtown areas.\nIn such a case, 0% of  in City X is being caused by people who work downtown. Even in such a case, the plan can still succeed – these people can reduce traffic congestion in City X by going for public transportation instead of their own vehicles.\nSo, in reality, it is not necessary for even a tiny amount of downtown traffic congestion in City X to be from people who work downtown. In such a situation, . Hence, this option is also not Must Be True (MBT).\n\n\n\n. Even if non-downtown area traffic congestion caused by people working downtown gets reduced thanks to the plan, the plan will be a success. So, this being the most effective way to reduce downtown area traffic congestion is not really needed for the conclusion to hold true.\nAlso, . Even if the plan is the least effective of all possible plans, as long as it reduces traffic congestion even slightly, it is a success; the conclusion will hold true. Hence, option D is also not the correct answer. \n\n\n\n) who receive the coupon i.e., take the pledge, will sometimes i.e.,  carpool/use public transport during the next year. If this is so, it will definitely lead to a reduction in traffic congestion (however tiny).\n\nLet us negate and check. \n Notice how we visualized that for the conclusion to hold true, the plan only has to reduce traffic congestion – even a tiny amount of reduction works. This helped us eliminate options like A.\n2.  can lead to several strong assumptions.\n3.  Notice how we did not just reject C directly on account of “Most.” We first understood the distinction between traffic congestion and downtown area traffic congestion and then figured out that “Most” was not needed.

        "question": "Nearly all employees of the factory who have completed their high school diploma have earned their factory safety certificate, having easily completed the eight week training course. The high school graduates who haven't earned the certificate are ones who have evening obligations that have prevented them from taking the course. Overall, though, most of the factory workers have not earned the certificate.\n\nIf the statements above are true, which one of the following also must be true?\n\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The credited answer is (D). If most factory workers with high school degrees have completed the training, then most of the factory workers who haven't completed the training must be folks without high school degrees. Since the factory workers who haven't completed the training in the vast majority, and since factory workers with high school degrees can only account for a very small number of these, then most of the factory workers must not have high school degrees.\n\nWe don't know how many factory workers with high school degrees have evening obligations. We know that the factory workers with high school degrees who haven't completed the training have evening obligations that prevent them from completing it, but among the factory workers with high school degrees who have completed the training, we don't know what proportion has evening obligations, and how the size of this group might compare to the number of the factory workers with high school degrees who haven't completed the training. Choice (A) is incorrect.\n\nAs explained above, the information lead us to deduce that many factory workers without high school degrees haven't completed the training course, but that does mean that none have. Choice (B) is too extreme, and it is incorrect.\n\nWe don't know the relative proportions of worker with or without high school degrees; as discuss above, we have grounds to suspect that the latter is a larger group. We know that many of the factory workers with high school degrees have completed the training and have earned the certificate, but we have no idea what proportion of the factory workers without high school degrees have done so, and how the number of this latter group compares to the former group. We have no way to know which is greater. Choice (C) is incorrect.\n\nThe information suggests that, among high school graduates, most of the folks who took the course were able to earn the certificate with little difficulty. Is this generally the case? Is it the case for folks who weren't able, for whatever reason, to complete their high school degree? We don't know. The prompt provides no information on this point.

Sixty percent of the total taxable income from foreign sources came from the 200 returns reporting income from 10 or more countries.\n\nIf the statements above are true, which of the following must also be true?\n\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A is not correct. Whereas corporations with net incomes of above $ 100 million account for more than half of the total taxable income from foreign sources, we cannot tell from the information given what proportion of their own total incomes from all sources is derived from incomes from foreign sources. \n\nThe second answer choice is incorrect. All we can infer is that 47 percent was reported by taxpayers other than corporations with net incomes above $ 100 million. These taxpayers could be other corporations with somewhat lower incomes. \n\nC is not the correct answer choice. The figures of 53 and 60 percent refer to percentages of total taxable income from foreign sources. Neither these nor any other figures in the passage refer to or imply any percentages of all reported taxable income. \n\nE, the last choice, is also incorrect.

While playing recreational sports can help reduce the emotional depression caused by discontinuing the use of such drugs, some amount of emotional depression is unlikely to be preventable.\n \nIf all of the above statements are true, which of the following must be true?\n \n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "This passage does not have a conclusion, so don't try to make one up. In fact, the question is basically asking you to identify a statement that  be the conclusion given the facts in the passage. Instead, ask yourself, \"What's the heart of the passage?\" or \"What is the author trying to do?\" In this case, the author wants to convey that playing recreational sports can help reduce but NOT  the emotional depression caused by discontinuing the use of such drugs.\n\nOnce you understand the author's purpose, make sure you understand the structure of the passage:\n\n habit-forming drugs is discontinued. Make sure you pay attention to that little modifier . The passage does not say that ALL habit-forming drugs cause emotional depression. the emotional depression caused by discontinuing the use of such drugs\" - Again, pay attention to the language choice. Playing recreational sports CAN help reduce the emotional depression; this does not mean that playing recreational sports WILL necessarily reduce the emotional depression.Remember, the passage says that MOST (not ALL) habit-forming drugs cause emotional depression. Thus, we cannot conclude that individuals who discontinue the use of ANY habit-forming drugs will experience at least some emotional depression. (A) can be eliminated.\n\nAll we know is that playing recreational sports can help reduce the emotional depression caused by discontinuing the use of many habit-forming drugs. We are not told that participating in recreational sports reduces the likelihood of suffering from emotional depression in general. This statement could be true, but it is not strongly supported by the passage. Eliminate (B).\n\nWe are told that \"discontinuing the use of most habit-forming drugs causes emotional depression.\" Thus, discontinuing the use of an addictive opioid will likely cause emotional depression. Playing recreational sports can help REDUCE that emotional depression, but \"some amount of emotional depression is unlikely to be preventable.\" Thus, we can logically conclude that an individual who discontinues the use of an addictive opioid will most likely suffer from some emotional depression despite playing a recreational sport such as tennis. Choice (C) looks good.\n\nYes, discontinuing the use of habit-forming drugs will likely cause some emotional depression, but this does not mean that those individuals will AVOID emotional depression by continuing to use those drugs. Those individuals could develop emotional depression for a variety of other reasons, and we have no idea how likely it is for those individuals to avoid emotional depression.

        "answer": "Edited the question.",

First, identify the conclusion: \"It is unlikely that this disproportionate increase in complaints was rooted in an increase in overall dissatisfaction with the service Comfort Airlines provides.\" Why is this unlikely, according to the author?\n\n the number of flight delays would also  the number of complaints. Instead, flight complaints went up THREE TIMES. Why? Perhaps customers were dissatisfied with other aspects of the airline's service and not just the delays?This might explain why the airline had twice as many delayed flights last year, but we still have an unexplained discrepancy: If the number of flight delays was doubled, why was the number of complaints tripled? (A) might be true, but it does not resolve the apparent discrepancy.\n\nAh, before we were only considering the NUMBER of flight delays, not the LENGTH of those flight delays. Maybe in the year before last, the average length of the flight delays was relatively low. Thus, only a small portion of customers felt the need to complain. If the average length of the flight delays was HIGHER last year, that might prompt more customers to complain.\n\nIn other words, if the NUMBER of flight delays doubled but the LENGTH of those delays remained the same, then we would only expect the number of complaints to double. But if the number of flight delays doubled and the length of those delays INCREASED, we would expect more than twice the number of complaints.\n\nChoice (D) resolves the apparent discrepancy and is the best choice.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

Such newly thin persons will, therefore, ultimately regain weight until their body size again matches their metabolic rate.\n\n\n\nThe conclusion of the argument above depends on which of the following assumptions?\n\n\n\nA: Relatively few very overweight people who have dieted down to a new weight tend to continue to consume substantially fewer calories than do people whose normal weight is at that level.  \n\n\n\nYES.  We know from the question that the metabolism of these very overweight people remains unchanged despite their weight loss.  As such, in order to maintain their lower weight, they will have to consume fewer calories than people whose normal weight is at that level (and whose metabolisms are faster).  If these newly thinner very overweight people maintain the same calorie count as their normal weight counterparts, they will gain weight.  The fact that few of them do means that they will regain weight until their body size matches their metabolic rate.\n\n\n\nB: The metabolisms of people who are usually not overweight are much more able to vary than the metabolisms of people who have been very overweight.\n\n\n\nIrrelevant.\n\n\n\nC: The amount of calories that a person usually burns in a day is determined more by the amount that is consumed that day than by the current weight of the individual.\n\n\n\nThis contradicts the passage.  The passage tells us that very overweight people tend to have slower metabolic rates.  Slower metabolic rates means that they will burn fewer calories per day.  This rate is unrelated to the amount of calories consumed and relies instead on the weight of the individual (of course, this is a bit tricky, since very overweight people's metabolic rates don't change a lot when they lose weight through dieting... sigh).\n\n\n\nD: Reseachers have not yet determined whether the metabolic rates of formerly very overweight individuals can be accelerated by means of chemical agents.\n\n\n\nIrrelevant.\n\n\n\nE: Because of the constancy of their metabolic rates, people who are at their usual weight normally have as much difficulty gaining weight as they do losing it.  \n\n\n\nIrrelevant.\n\n\n\nI'd go with A because...\n\n\n\nWe know from the question that when very overweight people lose weight by dieting alone, their metabolism remains the same.

If more motorcyclists took these courses, there would be fewer serious motorcycle accidents. Data show that 92% of the motorcyclists who are involved in a serious motorcycle accident have never taken a motorcycle-safety course. \n\nIn assessing whether the data cited provided support for the position taken about motorcyclists' taking the courses, it would be most useful to determine which of the following?\n\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is an evaluate question.  We need to identify the central assumption and find an answer choice that, when answered, would either strengthen or weaken the conclusion.\n\nThe argument is: Because 92% of motorcyclists involved in bad motorcycle accidents have never taken a safety course (evidence), there would be fewer bad motorcycle accidents if more motorcyclists took safety courses (conclusion). \n\nA shift in scope underpins the central assumption: that  motorcyclists involved in bad motorcycle accidents (the sample) are representative of motorcyclists in general (the group).  We have data on the sample (92% don't have training), but we need a way to compare that data to similar data for the group as a whole.\n\nSo we can expect that the answer will address the sample's representativeness in some way.\n\nA - Correct. If significantly more than 8% of motorcyclists in general (the group) have taken a safety course, we can then compare that to the implied 8% of the sample who have taken a safety course.  For instance, if 25% of the group has taken a safety course, but only 8% of the sample has taken a safety course, then there's a strong negative correlation between motorcyclists who have taken safety courses and those who have been involved in bad accidents. This strengthens the argument. Now let's say that only 1% of the group has taken a safety course; that means that there's a strong positive correlation between motorcyclists who have taken safety courses and those who have been involved in bad accidents. This weakens the argument. \nB - Out of scope; argument says nothing about passengers\nC - Also out of scope; we're not interested in comparing between different safety courses.\nD - A few previous posters selected this, so let's puzzle it out. It mentions the 92% proportion and so might address representativeness--but it only mentions the 92% in connection with collisions with other vehicles in motion, which is irrelevant. Note that we're no longer talking about the 92% of motorcyclists involved in bad accidents without training; we're talking about 92% of all bad accidents. This is a shift in scope. \nE - Also out of scope; we're not interested in the influence of size/speed, but taking vs. not-taking a safety course",

        "question": "Last year Comfort Airlines had twice as many delayed flights as the year before, but the number of complaints from passengers about delayed flights went up three times. It is unlikely that this disproportionate increase in complaints was rooted in an increase in overall dissatisfaction with the service Comfort Airlines provides, since the airline made a special effort to improve other aspects of its service last year.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most helps to explain the disproportionate increase in customer complaints?\n",
        "answer": "Edited the question.",
        "explanation": "Lots of questions about A and D, so let's take a step back and make sure we understand the argument. First, identify the conclusion: \"It is unlikely that this disproportionate increase in complaints was rooted in an increase in overall dissatisfaction with the service Comfort Airlines provides.\" Why is this unlikely, according to the author?\n\n the number of flight delays would also  the number of complaints. Instead, flight complaints went up THREE TIMES. Why? Perhaps customers were dissatisfied with other aspects of the airline's service and not just the delays?This might explain why the airline had twice as many delayed flights last year, but we still have an unexplained discrepancy: If the number of flight delays was doubled, why was the number of complaints tripled? (A) might be true, but it does not resolve the apparent discrepancy.\n\nAh, before we were only considering the NUMBER of flight delays, not the LENGTH of those flight delays. Maybe in the year before last, the average length of the flight delays was relatively low. Thus, only a small portion of customers felt the need to complain. If the average length of the flight delays was HIGHER last year, that might prompt more customers to complain.\n\nIn other words, if the NUMBER of flight delays doubled but the LENGTH of those delays remained the same, then we would only expect the number of complaints to double. But if the number of flight delays doubled and the length of those delays INCREASED, we would expect more than twice the number of complaints.\n\nChoice (D) resolves the apparent discrepancy and is the best choice.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "A study found that a field of genetically engineered corn had spread its genes into neighboring wild grasses, raising fears that these genes could alter wild grass species throughout the region. However, when the genetically engineered corn was removed, a follow-up study two years later could not find any trace of engineered corn genes in local grasses.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most helps to explain the discrepancy between the two studies?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "We see that the passage presents a surprising outcome: Genes from genetically engineered corn spread into neighboring grasses, and the fear was that the genes would spread to wild grasses throughout the region, but two years later the genes from the corn had not spread but instead could not be found in local grasses.\n\n\n\nI think it doesn't quite make sense to say that there was a \"discrepancy\" between the studies since the studies were done at different times two years apart. So, it makes more sense to say that the studies found two different situations. All the same, we can tell what the correct answer must do. It must explain why, even though the corn genes were found in the grasses by the first study, none of the corn genes in question were found in the local grasses two years later.\n\n\n\nThis choice is interesting.\n\nAfter all, the fact that \"grasses without the engineered corn genes were much better able to survive and reproduce in that region than grasses with such genes,\" could explain why none of the modified corn genes were found in the local grasses.\n\nWhat could have happened in that case was that, after the corn was removed, the grasses with the gene did not survive and reproduce as well as the grasses without the gene. So, over time, the grasses with the gene disappeared and the grasses without the gene took over. As a result, by the time the second study was conducted, little to no grass with the gene still existed in the area, and none was found.\n\nSo, the information provided by this choice helps to explain why no modified corn genes were found in the grasses.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nIf anything, this choice make the situation more surprising rather than explains why no modified corn genes were found.\n\nAfter all, if the second study was more thorough, then the likelihood that any corn genes in the grass would have been found was even higher than in the case of the first study, but still none of the genes were found.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe fact that the genes spread in less than two years doesn't explain why the genes disappeared.\n\nAfter all, if the genes spread in less than two years, two years later, we would expect EVEN MORE SPREAD, not the disappearance of the genes.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice does basically the opposite of what we need.\n\nAfter all, if \"Engineered corn genes are readily transferred and spread among many different species of wild grasses,\" then we would have expected that the corn genes would have spread, rather than disappeared.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is tricky because it could seem to explain why no corn genes were found. After all, if most will grass species in the region were not susceptible to alteration by the genetically engineered corn genes, then we'd conceivably have a reasonable explanation for why none of the genes were found in the wild grasses. Perhaps local grasses exposed to the gene were not affected or not enough were affected for the genes to be found in a study.\n\nAt the same time, there's an issue with this choice, and it's that, from the passage, we already have the information that the genes DID SPREAD into the wild grasses and WERE FOUND in the first study. That's why the situation is surprising, right?\n\nSo, what we have to explain isn't just why the genes didn't spread, it's why, surprisingly, the second study did not find the genes even though the first study did.\n\nSo, even if MOST wild grass species in the region were not susceptible to alteration by the genetically engineered corn genes, apparently, at the time of the first study ENOUGH GRASS TO BE FOUND was susceptible to alteration by the genetically engineered corn genes and had been altered.\n\nSo, even if this choice is true, we are left with the question of WHAT HAPPENED WITH ALL THE GRASS THAT WAS ALTERED. Sure, most of the grass in the region was not altered, but some was. So, where did it go?\n\nThus, the information provided by this choice leaves the key question unanswered. In other words, it leaves unexplained the fact that no modified corn genes were found in the grasses by the second study even though such genes were found in the grasses by the first study.\n\nEliminate.\n\n A­",

        "question": "Hardin argued that grazing land held in common (that is, open to any user) would always be used less carefully than private grazing land.  Each rancher would be tempted to overuse common land because the benefits would accrue to the individuals, while the costs of reduced land quality that results from overuse would be spread among all users.  But a study comparing 217 million acres of common grazing land with 433 million acres of private grazing land showed that the common land was in better condition.\n\nWhich of the following, if true and known by the ranchers, would best help explain the results of the study?\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "Let's start by identifying the discrepancy between Hardin's argument and the results of the study:\n\n of reduced land quality from overuse would be spread among all users. condition. This goes against Hardin's argument. We need an answer choice that explains this discrepancy.\nWhich of the following, if true and known by the ranchers, would best help explain the results of the study? \n\nThis helps explain Hardin's point of view, but it does not explain why the results of the study do not match Hardin's argument. Eliminate (A).\n\nChoice (B) tells us that it if, say, 20 ranchers are sharing some common land, then it is difficult to measure the cost in reduced land quality caused by any one user.\n\nOn the other hand, with private land, any cost in reduced land quality could be attributed to the rancher who owns the land. Determining the exact cost might be difficult, but we would not have to worry about dividing up the blame.\n\nThis information helps to explain Hardin's position. If (B) were NOT true, it might be easier to point a finger at any one rancher and say, \"Hey, your overuse of the common land has cost us all X dollars!\" That would make it harder for the ranchers to take advantage of the shared land.\n\nBut (B) does not explain the results of the study, so it should be eliminated.\n\nAgain, this helps to explain Hardin's position. Choice (C) gives us even more reason to expect that ranchers would try to overuse common land and that the private land would be in better condition. (C) does not explain the results of the study, so it should be eliminated. \n\nAccording to Hardin, an individual rancher would have an incentive to overuse public grazing lands. Why? Because the rancher would accrue benefits from overusing the land, and the costs of the overuse would be spread among all users.\n\nBut according to choice (D), if an individual rancher tries to exploit the common land as described by Hardin, then the other users are likely to overuse the land to an even greater extent. As more and more users start to overuse the common land, the costs of overuse start to outweigh the benefits, even though those costs are spread among all users.\n\nIn other words, if only ONE rancher tries to exploit the system, then that rancher will benefit at the expense of the other users. But, if (D) is true and KNOWN by the ranchers, then all of the ranchers are aware that any such attempt will end up costing them in the long run. Thus, despite the temptation described by Hardin, the ranchers would not want to overuse the common land.\n\n(D) explains the discrepancy, so keep this one.\n\nWe are not concerned with the number of acres of common and private land. We are only concerned with the  of each type.

        "question": "A local farmer is hoping to establish a certified organic farm but is concerned about the cost of setting it up. A certified organic farm requires far fewer supplies than a non-organic farm, and most of the supplies are less costly in comparison. Also, because an organic farm does not use expensive pesticides or tools, the cost of maintenance is also fairly low in comparison to the maintenance cost of a non-organic farm. But the set-up of the certified organic farm remains expensive, and the farmer is unsure if the return on his investment will justify the cost.\n\nWhich of the following statements best explains the farmer’s concern about the high cost of setting up a certified organic farm?\n\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Question asks the student to consider a passage about a local farmer’s interest in establishing a certified organic farm, and in particular the farmer’s concerns about the cost of set-up. Since the passage notes that the certified organic farm requires fewer and less expensive supplies than a non-organic farm, and that the maintenance cost is relatively low, the student is asked to select an answer choice that best explains the farmer’s concerns about cost. The correct answer choice will supply a clear explanation for where the cost is involved – some outside expense that is related directly to the set-up of the farm.\n\n\n\nD Answer choice (D) most clearly explains the reason for the farmer’s concerns about cost. Although the cost of supplies and maintenance might be lower than that of a non-organic farm, the cost of the certification itself is very high, creating a financial burden for the farmer as he tries to establish the certified organic farm. Answer choice (D) is correct.\n\n\n\nA, C Although the demand in the community for organic food, as well as the presence of three other large organic farms, might affect the farmer’s success in the long run, these factors do not affect the cost of set-up, about which the farmer is concerned. Answer choices (A) and (C) provide irrelevant information, so both are incorrect.\n\nB Answer choice (B) clearly contradicts the statement made in the passage: “A certified organic farm requires far fewer supplies than a non-organic farm.” Therefore, answer choice (B) cannot be correct and should be eliminated immediately.\n\nE The passage notes that the certified organic farm requires fewer supplies and that these supplies are less costly when compared to the supplies required on a non-organic farm. As a result, even if the supplies are unique and must be special-ordered – as answer choice (E) claims – they still should not contribute to the cost about which the farmer is concerned. Answer choice (E) is thus incorrect.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "Some scientists believe that 65 million years ago an asteroid struck what is now the Yucatan Peninsula, thereby causing extinction of the dinosaurs. These scientists have established that such a strike could have hurled enough debris into the atmosphere to block sunlight and cool the atmosphere. Without adequate sunlight, food sources for herbivorous dinosaurs would have disappeared, and no dinosaurs could have survived a prolonged period of low temperatures. These same scientists, however, have also established that most debris launched by the asteroid would have settled to the ground within six months, too soon for the plants to disappear or the dinosaurs to freeze.\n\nWhich one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy between the scientists’ beliefs and the scientists’ results, as described above?\n\n",

The belief is that the asteroid would have \"hurled enough debris into the atmosphere to block sunlight and cool the atmosphere.\" This would have caused the food sources for herbivorous dinosaurs to disappear.\n\nBUT we seem to have a problem with this explanation: most debris launched by the asteroid would have settled to the ground within six months, too soon for the plants to disappear or the dinosaurs to freeze. If that's the case, what caused the extinction?\n\nAs stated in choice (A), it is certainly true that loss of the herbivorous dinosaurs would have deprived the carnivorous dinosaurs of their food source, but this does not explain the apparent discrepancy. We need something that explains why the herbivorous dinosaurs would have become extinct in the first place.\n\nSince the debris settled within six months, the asteroid most likely did not eliminate the food sources. So how did the asteroid cause the extinction? Well, if the debris led to fatal respiratory problems, then that could have killed off all or most of the dinosaurs.

        "question": "People who take what others regard as a ridiculous position should not bother to say, “I mean every word!” For either their position truly is ridiculous, in which case insisting that they are serious about it only exposes them to deeper embarrassment, or else their position has merit, in which case they should meet disbelief with rational argument rather than with assurances of their sincerity.\n\nWhich one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the argument above?\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "(A)The first step in this Parallel Reasoning question is to abstract from the specifics of the stimulus. In general terms, the stimulus provides a case in which a statement uttered in response to a particular situation is attacked as an ineffectual response; there are only two possible scenarios, and both expose the futility of the statement (if the original position is wrong, the given response would make matters look worse; if the position is right; the response does nothing to prove it). The parallel choice we’re looking for should therefore show that a given response shouldn’t be used because, whether the party under attack is right or wrong, the response is ineffective. We don’t have to look far. (A) says that when a practice has been denounced, it shouldn’t be defended by saying, “this is how we’ve always done it.” The reason for this is exactly parallel to the original’s “lose-lose” element: if the practice is a poor one, the response makes matters look even worse; if the practice is wise, the answer doesn’t provide good support for it. (A) fits the stimulus form to a T.\n\n(B) Unlike the stimulus, there’s no issue of the initial opinion being right or wrong.

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Parallel Reasoning. The correct answer choice is (A)\n\nThis argument follows a classic cause-and-effect paradigm: just because two occurrences are correlated (studying music and being proficient in math), that does not mean that one necessarily causes the other. It is equally plausible that both share a common cause (such as growing up in a family that encourages intellectual and artistic pursuits).\n\n. Just as in the stimulus, we are dealing with a correlation — this time between failing to pay attention and performing poorly in school. In both arguments we are warned against inferring a cause-and-effect relationship between the two, as it is always possible that a third factor (undiagnosed hearing problems in this case) can be the common cause for both.\n\nAnswer choice (B): There is no element of common cause that might be responsible for two occurrences that are correlated. This answer choice is incorrect.\n\nAnswer choice (C): While this answer choice is similar to the stimulus in that they both question the validity of a certain causal relationship (consuming vegetables does not necessarily prevent heart disease, just as studying music does not necessarily improve one's ability to do math), the author does not speculate as to what might be the common cause that explains the correlation. Because this element was crucial to the argument contained in the stimulus, this answer choice is incorrect.\n\nAnswer choice (D): This answer choice merely suggests that two required conditions for becoming a physician (studying biology and chemistry) should not be thought of as sufficient for one's success a physician.\n\nAnswer choice (E): This answer choice may seem tempting at first, since vigorous exercise does not necessarily make you healthy, just as studying music does not necessarily make you better at math. However, the parallel ends here. We have no reason to suspect, for instance, that the correlation between vigorous exercise and health can be explained by a common cause. Instead, we are simply told that vigorous exercise may not be all that necessary in the end, since it is possible that exercise that is even less vigorous also has beneficial effects. This would be like saying that studying music does not necessarily make you better at math, because merely listening to music may sometimes be enough. This answer choice is therefore incorrect.",

        "question": "School Principal: Recent testing indicates that students in our school are struggling in math. At this time, the students are spending only forty-five minutes each day on math lessons. The testing also indicates that students are excelling in reading, however. The students currently spend one and a half hours each day on reading. Therefore, we need to increase the amount of time spent on math in order to improve the math skills of students in our school.\n\nThe weakness in the school principal's argument is similar to the weakness in which of the following arguments?\n\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This question presents a statement by a school principal regarding how well students are doing in certain subject areas. The students recently completed some testing, and the principal notes that the students scored badly in the math tests compared to their performance on reading tests. The principal then notes that students spend more class time on reading than on math and concludes that students need to spend as much time on math as on reading in order to improve the math scores. The question asks the student to compare the flaw in the principal’s reasoning to the flaw in the reasoning of the answer choices.\n\nIn order to find an answer choice with a comparable flaw, it is first necessary to identify how the principal’s argument proceeds and then decide where the flaw develops. The principal first looks at the test results of two different subjects and sees that the students did badly on one and well on the other. Looking for a quality that distinguishes these two, the principal realizes that the students spend less time on math than on reading. Thus, the conclusion follows that students should spend as much time on math as on reading. The problem with this is that the argument assumes quantity = quality, with no regard for other considerations, such as the skills of the math teachers at the school, the usefulness of the curriculum, and so forth. The correct answer choice will follow this pattern of quantity = quality, with a specific outcome desired based on the investment of a certain quantity and a disregard for other significant considerations.\n\n\n\nC The reasoning in answer choice (C) is similarly flawed to the principal’s reasoning in that two items are compared (options trading and stock trading), and the outcome is assumed to be based on the invested quantity (money in options vs. money in stocks). The argument indicates that traders invest more money in stocks than they do in options and that they also tend to make more money. No other considerations are mentioned in this comparison, such as the skill of the trader, the history of the stock’s movement, and so forth. The conclusion about outcome is reached solely upon the basis of the quantity invested, so the reasoning in answer choice (C) most closely parallels the principal’s reasoning.\n\n\n\nA, D Answer choices (A) and (D) are incorrect, because the conclusions reached in both arguments do not parallel the principal’s conclusion in any way. The argument in choice (A) is that parents should read in order to help improve their children’s speech development skills. The argument in choice (D) is that students should take certain kinds of high school classes to be successful in college. Both answer choices suggest that a specific action should be taken to achieve results of certain quality, but the formula quantity = quality is not present in any form in either answer choice.\n\nB This answer choice seems promising at first, with the conclusion that the number of stars identifying a resort (quantity) translates automatically to the comfort of a stay there (quality). But unlike the principal’s conclusion, this conclusion does not require a specific change in the quantity of action or investment to reach it, so it is not close enough to parallel it. Had answer choice (B) indicated that the resorts with the most stars tend to be the most successful, with the conclusion that a specific resort should improve its business plan and seek to obtain more stars, it would be comparable. As it is, though, answer choice (B) may be eliminated.\n\nE Answer choice (E) has no relevance to the principal’s conclusion and can be eliminated immediately. The conclusion in (E) relates only to quantity; the question of quality does not arise at any point in this particular example.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "Studies show that repeated exposure to an allergen can trigger anaphylaxis.

        "explanation": "Sure Deepthis!\n\nThe questions asks us to mimic the reasoning of the argument. How does the author present his argument?\n\nRepeated exposure to an allergen can trigger anaphylaxis (can be life threatening). \nThen even minimal exposure can be life threatening.\n(Repeated exposure reduces the resistance of the person against the allergen. Finally even minimal exposure of the allergen can be life threatening)\n\nB. Because minor earthquakes can weaken the existing infrastructure in an area, a series of minor earthquakes sometimes causes much more extensive damage than might otherwise be expected.\n\nMinor earthquakes weaken the infra so series of minor earthquakes keep weakening the infra more and more. Finally, even that small earthquake in the series can cause much more damage than you would expect. Just like minimal exposure can also be life threatening after repeated exposure to allergen.\n\nC. Peanut allergy sufferers do not need to ingest peanut products in order to experience an allergic episode; a reaction can also be triggered by touching peanuts or peanut oils.\n\nMinimal exposure to peanuts can produce an allergic reaction. But here, 'repeated exposure to something before' is missing.. As far as the argument goes, we don't know whether peanut allergy sufferers develop this condition by repeated exposure to peanuts or even without much exposure. In fact, the way it is worded, I would like to believe that it doesn't matter how much they get exposed to peanuts beforehand.. if someone has an allergy to peanuts, it will be triggered by even the tiniest exposure...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

The average weight of Sifrhippus adults declined from 5.4 to 3.9 kilograms during a period of climatic warming that lasted about 175,000 years, then rose as the climate cooled again. The most likely explanation is that smaller mammals can shed heat more easily than larger ones—Sifrhippus must have adapted to the hot climate by shrinking because larger individuals would more often have died from overheating.\n\nWhich of the following would, if true, most strongly support the paleontologist's hypothesis?\n",

        "explanation": "The paleontologist's hypothesis is the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for the hypothesis is the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, the paleontologist reasons that, since Sifrhippus's size decreased when the climate warmed and increased when it cooled and since larger individuals would more often have died in hot conditions, the reason why Sifrhippus's size decreased is that \"Sifrhippus ... adapted to the hot climate by shrinking.\"\n\n\n\nThis question is a Strengthen question, and the correct answer will strengthen the support already provided or provide additional new support for the conclusion.\n\n\n\nThis choice weakens rather than strengthens the argument.\n\nAfter all, if this choice is true, then it could be the case that, rather than to shed heat, Sifrhippus shrank because Sifrhippus habitats shank.\n\nIn other words, this choice indicates that there is a reasonable alternative explanation for Sifrhippus's shrinking and thus makes it less likely that the paleontologist's hypothesis is correct.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice weakens rather than strengthens the argument.\n\nAfter all, if Sifrhippus went through several changes in average body size and weight that did not coincide with changes in climate, then the types of changes in Sifrhippus's size that occurred when the climate did change were also going on when the climate didn't change. In other words, the effects occurred without the supposed cause.\n\nThe fact that the effects occurred without climate changes indicates that climate changes may not have been the cause even when climate changes did occur.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice may seem to affect the strength of argument, but actually, it has no effect.\n\nThe passage states as fact that smaller animals can shed heat more easily and that larger animals would more often have died in hot conditions. So, even if this choice is true, and some particular species of small animals went extinct and some particular larger species thrived during periods of warming, it remains the case that shrinking could have helped Sifrhippus survive when it was hot.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice has no clear effect on the strength of the argument.\n\nAfter all, there's no clear relationship between the populations increasing and decreasing and Sifrhippus's size decreasing and then increasing.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is interesting.\n\nAfter all, it confirms the relationship between Sifrhippus's size and the climate by showing that, even within one time period, Sifrhippus adults were smaller where it was warm and larger where it was cooler.\n\nBy showing that the relationship between size and climate held even within one time period, this choice helps to eliminate other variables that could have changed over time and thus confirm that the key factor causing Sifrhippus to be smaller or larger was Sifrhippus's adaptation to different temperatures.\n\nThus, this choice strengthens the case for the hypothesis.\n\nKeep.\n\n E ­",

        "question": "Advice columnist: Several scientific studies have shown that, when participating in competitive sports, those people who have recently been experiencing major stress in their lives are several times more likely to suffer serious injuries than are other participants in competitive sports. Since risking serious injury is unwise, no sports activity should be used as a method for coping with stress.\n\nWhich one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the advice columnist’s argument?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Whoa, wait, what? The conclusion here is way out of whack with the premises. People who are stressed suffer more serious injuries when playing \"competitive\" sports. Like a kid who is very stressed about his college apps busting his head open on the football field. And risking serious injury is unwise. OK, I’m with you so far. But from this, you conclude that no sports activity should be used as a method for coping with stress? Uh… what about golf? Fishing? , for Chrissakes? The conclusion here is way way too strong. \n\nThe question then asks us to try to  the reasoning. Because this is a strengthen question, I’m looking for a big, strong premise that will prove the conclusion, or as close to proving it as possible. The way to prove the conclusion is to connect the argument’s premises to its conclusion. This is going to require some heavy lifting, since the conclusion was so far out of proportion to the premises. \n\nI can almost always predict the answer to questions like this, however. Here’s my crack at it: “All sports subject participants to risk of serious injury.” Of course that’s not true, but if it  true, then the argument would make a lot more sense.\n\nA) This is tricky, but it’s the correct answer. The premises, again, are, “It is unwise to risk serious injury, and stressed people are more likely to incur serious injury when they play competitive sports.” So it’s not a stretch to infer, from those premises, that it is unwise to play  sports to relieve stress. If you did, you’d be risking injury, which is unwise. When you add answer A to that, you then shouldn’t play  sport. Which was the conclusion of the argument. Looking back, it’s not exactly like our prediction but it does have the same effect of making  sports out of bounds. Looks pretty good.\n\nB) This does nothing to the argument.\n\nC) This is irrelevant because it is about people who have not been experiencing stress. Furthermore, even if it were relevant, it would only weaken because it says people , rather than should not, participate in competitive sports.\n\nD) This is a weakener. It’s the exact opposite of the conclusion. No way.\n\nE) This isn’t relevant and isn’t broad enough, because the argument wasn’t limited to only people who have had a history of sports injuries.\n\nOur answer is A, because it’s the only one that helps the argument reach its conclusion.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "For years the beautiful Renaissance buildings in Palitito have been damaged by exhaust from the many tour buses that come to the city. There has been little parking space, so most buses have idled at the curb during each stop on their tour, and idling produces as much exhaust as driving. The city has now provided parking that accommodates a third of the tour buses, so damage to Palitito's buildings from the buses' exhaust will diminish significantly.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most strongly supports the argument?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of the argument is simply that damage to Palitito's buildings from the [tour] buses' exhaust will diminish significantly. Notice that the conclusion refers specifically to damage from TOUR BUS exhaust, not to damage from all vehicles or damage from other factors.\n\nLet's examine the author's reasoning:\n\nAs stated above, the conclusion specifically refers to damage FROM THE TOUR BUSES' exhausts, not from automobiles. Choice (A) is thus irrelevant and can be eliminated.\n\nAgain, we are only concerned with damage from the exhaust of the buses. There might be a variety of other threats to the buildings, but if the new parking spaces reduce damage from the tour buses' exhaust, then the author's argument is valid. Eliminate (B).\n\nWhat if tour buses typically spend MOST of their time driving from site to site and only a small fraction of their time waiting at each site? In that case, most of the exhaust would be released while the buses were driving from place to place, NOT while the buses were idling at each site. If that were true, the introduction of new parking spaces might help a little but would probably not have a  impact on the exhaust damage. This would weaken the author's argument. Choice (C) tells us that this is NOT the case and thus strengthens the argument. Hang on to this one.\n\nChoice (D) tells us that tourists visiting Palitito use tour buses more than any other mode of transportation. This suggests that the impact from the tour buses probably exceeds the impact from other modes of transportation. But we aren't trying to show that exhaust from tour buses represents the GREATEST impact to the buildings. Even if tour buses only represent a small fraction of tourist transportation to Palitito, the author's argument could still be valid as long as the new parking spaces significantly diminish the damage from the  exhaust.\n\nIn other words, the level of exhaust damage before the spaces were installed does not matter. As long as the new spaces significantly reduce the level of exhaust damage from the tour buses, the author's reasoning is sound. Eliminate (D).\n\nDriving around produces just as much exhaust as idling at the curb. So choice (E) simply reinforces the idea that the buildings can be subject to exhaust damage when tour buses cannot find parking (whether the buses idle at the curb or drive around). Obviously some buses will continue to drive around or idle even after the new spaces have been installed (i.e. when they cannot find a parking space), but if the new spaces REDUCE the amount of driving around/idling, then the author's argument is valid. However, choice (E) does not provide any evidence to suggest that the new spaces will in fact decrease the amount of idling or driving around and thus has no impact on the author's argument. Eliminate (E).\n\nChoice (C) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "It was once thought that pesticide TSX-400 was extremely harmful to the environment but that pesticides Envirochem and Zanar were environmentally harmless. TSX-400 was banned; Envirochem and Zanar were not. However, according to recent studies, Envirochem and Zanar each cause greater environmental harm than does TSX-400. If these studies are accurate, then either Envirochem and Zanar should be banned or TSX-400 should be legalized.\n\nWhich one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the argumentation?\n\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The evidence says new studies show that E and Z, which are legal, are more dangerous than T, which is banned. The conclusion is , in that it starts with the phrase, “If these studies are accurate.” So, if the studies are not accurate, then the argument doesn’t apply. The conclusion is also  (it uses the word or): “ E and Z should be banned, or T should be legalized.” So the author isn’t saying we should do both of those things: one or the other would suffice.\n\nThe argument asks us to “justify” the argumentation. That means it’s like a  question. When answering a Sufficient Assumption question we look for an answer choice that, if true, would make the conclusion logically valid. Here, however, we don't necessarily need something quite that strong, since we are only trying to strengthen the argument, rather than prove it. But if we do happen to find an answer choice that proves the argument, we'll definitely take it! Something like, “Nothing should be banned that is less dangerous than anything that is not banned.” would be nice. Alternatively, “Nothing should be legal that is more dangerous than anything that is banned.” These two statements would operate identically, in that if they were true, and if the studies were valid, then we would have to either unban T, or ban both E and Z.\n\nA) This wouldn’t do it, because the author of the original argument seems okay with just making everything legal. The author is primarily concerned with fairness : they can either both be banned, or both be unbanned, or the worse one can be banned and the safer one can be unbanned. The only bad outcome, according to the logic of the argument, is to have the safer one banned while the dangerous one is unbanned. So this ain’t the answer.\n\nB) Nope, same explanation as A. The author is fine with dangerous stuff being legal, as long as there is equitable treatment of the different substances.\n\nC) This rule could only ever be used to make things legal. The author would also be fine with making everything illegal. The author only cares about fairness between two competing substances.\n\nD) Ding ding ding! This answer is narrower than what we predicted (it’s specifically about pesticides, while our guess used the broader category “anything”), but it operates the same way. D is the principle that would justify the author’s conclusion.\n\nE) No, the author didn’t say, “We must ban all harmful pesticides and make legal all unharmful pesticides.” The author was only concerned with fair treatment between two different pesticides.\n\nD is the only answer that aligns with the author’s conclusion.­\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

This suggests that the presence of a familiar authority figure (like a parent), as opposed to a stranger, might have a significant impact on the children's choice to share specifically with siblings, reinforcing the observation's connection to familial authority.\n\nA.  This choice does not directly affect the children's decision to share with siblings versus non-siblings when observed by an adult. It focuses on the novelty of toys, which is unrelated to the influence of an adult observer on familial sharing behavior.\n\nC.  This choice introduces another variable (the age and competence of the children) that could influence sharing behavior, but it does not directly support the idea that observation by an adult specifically encourages sharing with siblings.\n\nD.  This option focuses on the availability of toys rather than the influence of an adult's presence on sharing behavior. While more toys might make sharing easier, it doesn’t specifically strengthen the argument about sharing more with siblings under adult observation.\n\nE.  This choice weakens the argument rather than strengthening it. If the adult encouraged sharing with all children equally, it suggests that the observed difference in sharing between siblings and non-siblings might not be influenced by the adult’s familial relationship but simply by general encouragement to share.­\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

This type of survey precisely reaches the target group, individuals with an income, and, because those individuals do not provide names or personal information, confidentiality is assured.

If I am wrong, please let me know I will help you further with the other statements.\n\nLet us first analyze the premise and the conclusion. The argument comes to the conclusion that the most effective and precise surveying technique for determining the extent of income  evasion in the United States is anonymous workplace survey. This conclusion is reached on the believes that this type of survey reaches the exact target group i.e. the workforce and that since people's identities are kept confidential, they will be more sincere with the survey. \nWe need to provide a point that provides criticism for this conclusion or argument. \nLet us pre-analyze the argument. A great criticism for the argument would attack the two main premises for the argument i.e. the survey reaches the precise group of people- the workforce and people will not lie as they are sure that the data collected in the survey will remain anonymous.\n\nNow, statement 2) tells us that some people might still lie for fear of being caught. However, notice the doubt in this case. The \"some\" might be .01% of workforce to 40 or more percentage of workforce. Hence, this does not give us concrete evidence or counterpoint against the argument.\n\nHowever, the first option clearly states that a significant number of income tax evaders have no legal source of income or place of an employment. This implies that these people are not being covered in the survey at all and thus, the survey might be missing a major proportion of tax evaders in the calculation. This conclusively proves that the survey is not as effective as the argument would like us to believe.\n\nHope this helps! Let me know in case of any further queries/doubts.",

If fewer and fewer musicians  that they have an aptitude for classical music, that might explain why fewer and fewer musicians are choosing to study classical music. Choice (A) doesn't seem to weaken the critic's reasoning, so (A) can be eliminated.\n\nThe author's argument is not concerned with  classical music's current meager popularity. Rather, the author discusses what he/she believes must be done to maintain the current level of popularity. Choice (B) can be eliminated because it does not weaken the critic's reasoning.\n\nThe critic reasons that audiences will move away from classical music as they listen to weaker performances of classical music. However, if most people who appreciate classical music come to do so through old recordings rather than live performances, it doesn't matter if the quality of the performances is in decline. Those people can still listen to old recordings and thus still appreciate the greatness of classical music. This breaks the critic's line of reasoning, so (C) is a solid choice.\n\nThe author does not argue that it will not be possible to enjoy classical music performed by musicians who are not ideally suited for that genre. Instead, the author argues that classical performances by musicians who are not ideally suited for that genre will fail to convey the  of classical music and thus cause audiences to listen to other types of music. Choice (D) does not weaken the critic's reasoning, so it can be eliminated.\n\nThe author does not claim that appreciation for the greatness of classical music is the ONLY necessary requirement for maintaining the current level of popularity. The popularity can certainly be affected by other factors, such as understanding why classical music attained its original popularity.

Say, two years back, the minimum wage was $8/hr and teenage unemployment rate was 10%. Say, today also minimum wage is $8/hr but teenage unemployment rate is now 20%. What does this tell us? It says that there are other factors at play for the increase in unemployment rate. The wages may have nothing to do with rising unemployment rate.

There must be fewer new residents moving to City X than there were previously. \n\nWhich of the following indicates a flaw in the reasoning above?\n\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "There are some problems in this question but nevertheless answer is  (A).\n\nPremises:\n\nDevelopers have stopped buying land, \nContractors have found themselves going without work for longer periods, \nBanks have issued fewer mortgages. \n(So fewer homes are getting constructed and bought)\n\nConclusion: There must be fewer new residents moving to City X than there were previously.\n\nA. This year several housing blocks have gone on the market after being held up for months by legal red tape.\nMany previously built housing units which were on hold have flooded the market leading to oversupply. Hence, it explain that developers and contractors are out of work. But it doesn't address the banks issuing fewer mortgages. With the banks in the picture, the argument shows us that fewer people are buying houses. The conclusion is that fewer new people are coming to city X. There could have been a much better weakener which explains that people are not buying houses because of the reduced rents or something similar. But this does go on to explain a part of the situation (fewer homes are getting constructed) so in case there is no other better option, we will go with this.\n\nB. The average size of a new home has increased significantly over the past several years.\nSize of the homes is out of scope. We are only concerned about the number of homes.\n\nC. Re-sales of condominiums have increased over the past six months.\nYou might think that this explains why developers and contractors are out of work since new  people could be buying old houses but people who are selling their houses would need new houses in this case. Hence it does not explain developers, contractors and bankers out of work. It doesn't weaken our conclusion much except if most people had multiple homes and are selling out of those. In that case, it would be similar to option (A) where it would explain fewer new constructions. But expecting most people to have multiple homes is too much of an assumption. So option (A) is better.\n\nD. The cost of materials such as lumber and cement has decreased over the past year.\nThis should encourage more construction, not less. Hence, not relevant.\n\nE. Sales of other big-ticket items, such as automobiles and boats, has remained steady over the past year.\nOut of scope. Perhaps people have started buying more automobiles and boats, we don't know. The relation between homes and other big ticket items is not known.\n\nAnswer (A)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Correlation = causation?! No way. The argument basically says, “Rich people have a lot of parties, so if you want to be rich, you should have a lot of parties.” That’s just silly. To weaken a correlation=causation argument, I’m going to look for the reversal of cause and effect (something like, “Actually, being profitable causes companies to have more parties”) or an alternative explanation (something like, “Companies with exceptionally creative employees are more profitable AND tend to have more parties”).\n\nA) Bingo! This is the reversal of cause and effect. For a question that comes so late in the section, this one is surprisingly easy.\n\nB) “Sometimes” makes this answer choice very weak. “Sometimes” just means “at least once.” But the evidence was about companies “on average,” so what happens at least once is really not a very powerful retort. A, on the other hand, which is about “the great majority of corporations that encourage social events,” is much stronger and therefore a much better weakener.\n\nC) Just because the EZ Corporation is already making above-average profits without parties does not mean it couldn’t make even higher profits  parties. This is not a good answer.\n\nD) This answer completely ignores the fact, as stated, that companies that have parties make more money than companies that don’t.

Trap. This answer choice, suggesting that the reduction in the instance of prosthetic rejection was because of a reduction in reporting symptoms of rejection, does not rule out the possibility that the reduction in reporting symptoms of rejection could be because of the new design; so, this answer choice simply adds information, which, although relevant to the broad context of the argument, does not weaken the conclusion. Because this answer choice does not weaken the conclusion, this answer choice is incorrect.\n\nB. This answer choice, suggesting that the initial goal was to achieve thirty percent rejection, indicates that the project’s ten percent reduction fell short of its target; however, failure to meet the target does not dispute the view that the new design reduced the instance of prosthetic rejection; so, this answer choice is just additional detail, which, although relevant to the broad context of the argument, does not weaken the conclusion. Because this answer choice does not weaken the conclusion, this answer choice is incorrect.\n\nC. This answer choice, suggesting that the new design has no changes in the material used, indicates the possibility that the design, rather than the material, caused the reduction, thus, if anything, strengthening, rather than weakening, the conclusion. Because this answer choice does not weaken the conclusion, this answer choice is incorrect.\n\nD. This answer choice, suggesting that the new design differs from the old design in the organization of components but not in cost, indicates the possibility that the design, owing to the new organization of components, caused the reduction, thus strengthening, rather than weakening, the conclusion. Because this answer choice does not weaken the conclusion, this answer choice is incorrect.\n\n By suggesting that two thirds of patients in the trial were young enough to naturally accept prosthetics, this answer choice indicates the possibility that the reduction in prosthetic rejection may have been because of the patients’ bodies naturally accepting prosthetics and not necessarily because of the improved design of the prosthetics; such a possibility casts doubt on the cause-effect relationship between the new design and the reduction and indicates the presence of another cause for the reduction, thus weakening the conclusion.

        "question": "Sports team owner: Government antitrust regulations are designed to prevent one business from gaining an excessive advantage over others. Such regulations are primarily intended to help consumers by ensuring healthy competition, which ultimately affects consumer prices. But in the case of professional sports teams, which are business enterprises, sports competition is their main product and thus an essential part of their business competition. Delivering exciting competition on the field of play is needed to help the teams profit from media-broadcast rights and sales of branded sports items. Thus, no antitrust regulations are needed to ensure healthy business competition among professional sports enterprises.\n\nThe sports team owner's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The author of the argument concludes the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for the conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nWe see that the author has reasoned that, because \"an essential part of their business competition\" is \"needed to help the teams profit,\" \"no antitrust regulations are needed to ensure healthy business competition among professional sports enterprises.\"\n\nThe correct answer must point out a flaw in that reasoning.\n\n\n\nIt's true that the argument does involve making the case that antitrust regulation of a type of business that does not provide manufactured goods, professional sports teams, is not needed.\n\nHowever, in making the argument, the author does not do what this choice says.\n\nRather, the author makes a case for not regulating professional sports teams even if it is the case that \"government regulation of competition occurs in some businesses that provide services.\"\n\n\nIn analyzing the argument, we see that integral to the evidence provided in support of the conclusion is the following:\n\n. on the basis of information about only , i.e., \"an aspect,\" of what these enterprises do.\n\nIn other words, a broad, general conclusion is supported by only narrow evidence, meaning that the conclusion goes beyond what the evidence clearly supports.\n\nThus, we can see that this choice points out a way in which the argument is flawed.\n\n\n\nThis choice is incorrect because it does not accurately describe what the argument does.\n\nReviewing the passage, we see that it says the following: \n\n\n\nSo, the argument clearly DOES consider \"that government antitrust regulations are primarily intended to be in the interest of consumers.\"\n\nSince this choice conflicts with what the passage does, it's clearly incorrect.\n\n\n\nNotice that the point of the argument is that, antitrust regulation of professional sports teams is not needed because professional sports teams will NOT gain excessive business advantages.\n\nThus, in saying that the argument presumes that \"a professional sports team CAN gain a significant business advantage,\" this choice basically goes against the point of the argument.\n\nSo, this choice doesn't accurately describe what the argument does and thus cannot describe a flaw in the argument.\n\n\n\nIt's true that the argument makes no distinction between team-based sports competition and other types of sports competition. However, making such a distinction is not necessary for the argument to work. After all, the argument is about the business dynamics among professional sports teams only, and the information provided about those types of businesses is sufficient for the argument to work.\n\nSo, the fact that the argument makes no distinction between team-based sports competition and other types of sports competition is not a flaw in the argument.\n\nThe correct answer is",

        "question": "When hypnotized subjects are told that they are deaf and are then asked whether they can hear the hypnotist, they reply, \"No.\" Some theorists try to explain this result by arguing that the selves of hypnotized subjects are dissociated into separate parts, and that the part that is deaf is dissociated from the part that replies.\n\nWhich of the following challenges indicates the most serious weakness in the attempted explanation described above?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Since we are trying to weaken an explanation, let's start by making sure we understand that explanation clearly:\n\nFirst, let's look at the result that we are trying to explain: \"When hypnotized subjects are told that they are deaf and are then asked whether they can hear the hypnotist, they reply, 'No.'\" -  This seems like a paradox.\n\n hear the question. But how could you have heard the question if you are deaf? Were you lying?\nSome theorists offer the following explanation: \"the selves of hypnotized subjects are dissociated into separate parts, and that the part that is deaf is dissociated from the part that replies.\" So what the heck does that mean?\n\nAccording to the theorists, the non-deaf part hears and replies to the question. Meanwhile, the  part is deaf. But if the subject is using the -deaf part to hear and reply to the question, that part should respond, \"Yes!\" to the question.\n\nSure, (A) does not PROVE that the theorists are wrong. Perhaps the hearing part is like a sports commentator who \"watches\" the deaf part and, like a good commentator,  that the other part is deaf.\n\nThe theorists  have a good answer to this challenge, but (A) definitely illustrates a serious weakness in the theorists' explanation. Hang on to (A).\n\nIn other words, (B) asks, \"Why do we even need to explain this paradoxical result?\". Well, regardless of whether there is a good  for explaining the result, the theorists have come up with an explanation. And we need an answer choice that indicates a weakness in that explanation. (B) does not illustrate a weakness, so eliminate this one.\n\nUnlike (A), choice (C) does not hit on a major flaw in the theorists' explanation. The theorists might not care  the subjects accept the suggestion. They only care about how the subjects reply to the question. The theorists' explanation might even help answer this question.\n\n(C) does not indicate a serious weakness in the theorists' explanation, so eliminate this one.\n\nAgain, does this question indicate a serious flaw in the theorists' explanation? If anything, the theorists' explanation might help answer this question: \"Well, they all respond the same way because they are all divided into a deaf part and a non-deaf part.\"\n\nUnlike (A), (D) does not address the theorists' logical flaw. Eliminate (D).\n\nAs with (C) and (D), this challenge does not indicate a serious weakness in the theorists' explanation. The theorists might not have a good explanation for WHY the self is always divided into the same separate parts. Regardless, their theory could explain the paradoxical result. In other words, the theorists aren't trying to explain how or why the division happens. They simply believe that the division explains the result. Eliminate (E).\n\n(A) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

Just because more papers are sold, we can't conclude that citizens of S are better informed.\nWhat if town S has many more people than town T? That will explain why more papers are sold in S. Option (A)\nWhat if town S people buy the newspapers for discount coupons but not read it? Again, then people of S may not be better informed. Option (C)\nWhat if newspapers printed in town S are of local news only. Then town S people will not be better informed about major world events.

Just because you price a product lower, doesn't mean it will automatically sell more. Only someone who wants to buy it will buy it.

        "question": "Journalists sometimes use historical photographs to illustrate articles about current events. But this recycling of old photographs overstates the similarities between past and present, and thereby denies the individual significance of those current events. Hence, the use of historical photographs in this manner by journalists distorts public understanding of the present by presenting current events as mere repetitions of historical incidents.\n\nWhich one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly inferred?\n\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "You would have to be one lazy-ass journalist to actually do this. Let’s see: It’s Election Day, so you want to put some pictures in the newspaper, but instead of going outside and taking new pictures of voters you just pull out the stock photo of some dude wearing a “Kerry-Edwards ’04” t-shirt and slap that on the front page? You’ve gotta be kidding me.\n\nAnyway, the conclusion of the argument says, “The use of historical photographs in this manner… distorts public understanding.” We are asked to find an answer choice that “enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly inferred.” In other words, we are asked to  the conclusion of the argument. To do so, we are allowed to choose one answer choice, A through E, to use as an additional premise.\n\nUsually, we can predict the answer on this type of question very closely. Since the premises all have to be accepted as fact, all we have to do is connect, directly, any one of the premises with the conclusion. We can do this with a smallish bridge: “Overstating the similarities between past and present distorts public understanding,” or, “Denying the individual significance of current events distorts public understanding”.\n\nI could also do it with a much bigger bridge, something like, “Any use of photographs distorts public understanding,” or even, “Everything anyone ever does distorts public understanding.” The correct answer probably isn’t going to be that absurdly big, but it could be and still be the correct answer. We’re not being asked to identify an assumption that the speaker actually made; we’re being asked to act as attorney for the speaker, and identify an additional fact that, if true, would prove the speaker’s conclusion true.\n\nWhether the bridge is big or small, it will get us to the desired conclusion. Let’s see.\n\nA) There’s nothing about “distortion” here, so this can’t be the answer. At least one end of my bridge has to be the conclusion of the argument.\n\nB) Okay, this one matches our first prediction, above. This will turn out to be our answer.\n\nC) How can we prove distortion with a premise that starts out “ a practice distorts”? That would be assuming our conclusion (circular reasoning). This is out.\n\nD) Nothing here about distortion. No way.\n\nE) This one is irrelevant because there is no premise that talks about journalist’s beliefs. One end of the bridge here is properly grounded in the conclusion, but the other end of the bridge is floating in the ocean.\n\nOur answer is B, because it’s the only bridge from the premises to the desired conclusion.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "Actually, the negation of \"If X, then Y\" is \"If X, MAYBE not Y.\" Let me give you an example:\n\nProposed Conditional: If you play the lottery, you will win millions of dollars.\n\nDo you agree with this proposed conditional? Probably not! So we want to negate it. Should we say \"If you play the lottery, you will NOT win millions of dollars\"? Wait, that doesn't seem right. People do win the lottery; it's just not a very common outcome. If we say \"It's not true that if you play the lottery, you will win millions of dollars,\" what we mean is \"It is possible to play the lottery and NOT win millions of dollars.\" The proposed sufficient condition (playing the lottery) can happen without the proposed necessary condition (winning millions). \n\nNegated Conditional: If you play the lottery, you MAY NOT win millions of dollars.\n\nNow what about a conditional that you think is wrong in ALL cases?\n\nCrazy Conditional: If you are in China, you are in Africa.\n\nWHAT?!? This is clearly false and we want to negate it, but it seems funny to say \"If you are in China, you MAY NOT be in Africa,\" right? It feels better to say \"If you are in China, you ARE NOT in Africa.\" Of course, that is true. However, the previous version (MAY NOT) is true, too. If you ARE NOT in Africa, then you MAY NOT be there. It's this weaker version that we can commit to every time that we negate a conditional. The stronger version may be true, too, but that's always the case with negations. Consider the negation of \"I love today's popular music.\" The negation is \"I do not love today's popular music.\" It may be the case that I *hate* this music, but that's additional information that's not required for a negation.\n\nSo, long story short:\n\nNOT (X --&gt; Y) = X --&gt; MAYBE NOT Y\nor \nNOT (X --&gt; Y) = X is possible without Y\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n |  |",

They did, but at only slightly lower prices than the now-high prices of foreign firms.

Many people got this right and, I daresay, this is one of those passages you read through for gist rather than detail.\n\nTrade protection is bad policy. Take the case of the microcomputer industry. The United States government attempted to restore the computer chip market to United States manufacturers, who had ceased production in the face of an abundant supply of cheap chips from foreign manufacturers. Under trade protection, it was expected that, as government-imposed quotas and excise taxes forced the price of foreign chips to rise, United States manufactures would reenter the market.

The lesson has been simple: trade protection means that United States manufactures gain while United States consumers lose.\n\nWhich one of the following is an assumption on which the author’s argument relies?\n\n\n(A) It is unreasonable to expect that government-imposed quotas and excise taxes will reduce prices for United States consumers.\nFirst off, is this even an ASSUMPTION by definition? Second, clearly this doesn’t seem to relate to the thrust of the author’s argument, which is based off a domino-effect analogy of what happens if trade protection occurs. Yellow flag.\n\n(B) United States manufacturers of computer chips are more concerned with high profits that are foreign manufacturers.\nThis is the true yet irrelevant choice. This doesn’t relate to the author’s argument. We need an assumption upon which the argument relies. Why is trade protection bad policy? Because US manufactures are more concerned with high profits? Yellow flag.\n\n(C) The United States government’s primary purpose in trade protection is to restore markets and profits to United States manufacturers.\nThis one was a little tempting. It ‘felt’ like a right answer choice. But it isn’t, since the third line of the passage is meant as an illustration for why trade protection is bad — not a reason for enacting trade protection policy itself. I’m seeing this on a later read, but when I initially went through the answer choices this was my top yellow flag, I think. I didn't go so deep into WHY it may be wrong.\n\n(D) With respect to trade protection, the microcomputer industry is representative of United States industry in general.\nYes, this feels good. The argument uses an illustration to convey its merit. The argument uses the microcomputer industry for this illustration. If I tried to convince you that all birds can fly using the example of a crow, the assumption is that, at the very least, crows represent all birds in that respect. Is that an Ostrich?! For the argument to work the microcomputer has to represent industries as a whole.\n\n(E) The quality of the chips produced by United States manufacturers is better than the quality of the chips produced by foreign manufacturers.\nIrrelevant. Let’s just leave it at that. I daresay this might be the answer choice for those who begin to create stories for it to work.\n\nGmatKnight dot com - Tutoring and free quick tips\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t -  -  -   - quick tip: there's a free auto-booking feature on the gmatknight site for a 15-min consult :)",

According to the commissioner, this is not a problem \"since virtually everyone has access to a private telephone.\"\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most strongly supports the claim that the proposal, if carried out, \"will reduce the number of prank calls without hampering people's ability to report a fire.\"?\n\n\nThe commissioner claims that the number of prank calls would be reduced if people could only report fires with private telephones rather than with public fire alarm boxes. But what if people could still make anonymous reports from their private telephones? That would weaken the commissioners argument. Choice (A) assures us that the private calls will, in fact, be traced, likely discouraging people from making prank calls from their private telephones. Thus, (A) supports the commissioner's claim.\n\n\nThe cost of maintaining the fire alarm boxes has nothing to do with the effect that removing those boxes would have on the number of prank calls or people's ability to report fires. Eliminate (B).\n\n\nChoice (C) describes a possible advantage of reporting fires with private telephones instead of fire alarm boxes. However, as with choice (B), this has nothing to do with the effect that removing those boxes would have on the number of prank calls or people's ability to report fires. (C) is out.\n\n\nChoice (D) explains a negative consequence of prank calls but does give us any reason to believe that removing the fire alarm boxes would reduce the number of prank calls.

        "question": "­Since the early 1990s, many airliners have been equipped with telephones for passenger use. However, the telephones are expensive for passengers to use and their use has declined, especially since cell phones have become more prevalent. Nevertheless, since airlines collect a portion of the charge for each call made without having to pay anything for the telephone equipment, which is owned and maintained by telephone companies, airlines clearly still benefit financially from the telephones.\n\nIn drawing its conclusion, the argument depends on assuming which of the following?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of the argument is the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for the conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nWe see that the reasoning of the argument is basically that, since airlines generate revenue without having to pay for the telephone equipment used to generate the revenue, airlines benefit financially, meaning, basically., make a profit, by having the phones on their planes.\n\n\n\nThe correct answer will state an assumption necessary for the evidence to support the conclusion.\n\n\n\nTo eliminate this choice, we need to notice that, even if the proportion of the charge for an in-flight telephone call that goes to the airline HAS declined since the early 1990s, airlines still collect a portion of the charge for each call made.\n\nSo, regardless of whether the proportion of the charge that goes to the airlines has declined, it still makes sense to conclude that airlines benefit financially from having the phones. After all, since the airlines don't pay anything for the telephone equipment, even if they don't get much revenue from the telephones, as long as they get some revenue, having the phones could benefit them financially.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that airlines benefit financially from the telephones.\n\nThis choice does not have to be true for that conclusion to follow from evidence. After all, even if the telephones do NOT remain profitable for telephone companies, they could still be a source of financial benefits for airlines.\n\nNow, it's true that, if the telephones are not profitable for telephone companies, telephone companies may not continue to maintain phones in planes.\n\nAll the same, given that, as the passage indicates, the phones are currently in planes, they could be profitable for the airlines even if they are not for telephone companies.\n\nSo, the argument works even if this choice is not true.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is interesting.\n\nAfter all, the conclusion is \"airlines clearly still benefit financially from the telephones.\"\n\nSo, what if this choice is not true and the telephone equipment DOES weigh enough to make a material difference in fuel consumption? In that case, it's not clear that airlines benefit financially from the telephones. After all, in that case, it could be that the cost associated with the additional fuel consumption caused by having the telephones offsets any revenue the airlines get by having the telephones.\n\nThus, in that case, airlines may not benefit financially from having the telephones even though they collect a portion of the charge without having to pay for the equipment.\n\nSo, for the argument to work, this choice must be true.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThe argument doesn't rely on this assumption about the preferences of passengers who do not use the phones.\n\nAfter all, regardless of what these passengers prefer, it could still be the case that, since airlines get revenue by having the phones but don't have to pay for them, airlines benefit financially by having the phones on their planes.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice may be tempting if we're not clear regarding what we're looking for. After all, this choice is plausible. So, if we see that this choice is plausible and forget that we need a necessary assumption, we might choose it.\n\nAt the same time, this choice is incorrect. After all, we don't need a choice that's just plausible. We need a choice that states an assumption on which the argument depends, and the argument doesn't depend on any particular passengers using the phones. After all, as long as someone uses the phones, the airlines get a portion of the charges and thus may benefit financially.\n\nSo, regardless of whether this choice is true, the argument works.\n\nEliminate.\n\n C",

Evidence to this effect comes from a study showing that the more social contact people report, the better their mental skills.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the force of the evidence cited?\n\n(A) As people grow older, they are often advised to keep exercising their physical and mental capacities in order to maintain or improve them.\n\n(B) Many medical conditions and treatments that adversely affect a person's mental sharpness also tend to increase that person's social isolation.\n\n(C) Many people are proficient both in social interactions and in solving mathematical problems.\n\n(D) The study did not itself collect data but analyzed data bearing on the issue from prior studies.\n\n(E) The tasks evaluating mental sharpness for which data were compiled by the study were more akin to mathematics problems than to conversation.\n\n\n\n What happens as people grow older is an entirely separate subject. This question deals with a group of people in general, so zeroing in on a random sub-set, a specific niche within the overall group about what those people can do to stay sharp as they grow old is irrelevant. It’s Out Of Focus.\n\n\n If some people are strong at both, that could appears to be aligned with the argument that we’re asked to weaken since it shows the presence of both the cause and effect. However, it’s just not clear entirely clear how C either strengthens or weakens.\n\n It’s not at all clear how analyzing data vs gathering and analyzing data from prior studies would weaken or strengthen. By itself, this option does nothing. \n\nThis option attacks the wrong end of the causal relationship. We need an option that points to an alternative cause of a boost in mental skills (as in we need an option that shows that it’s not social interaction that boosts mental skills). This option just attempts to redefine how mental skill is defined by the study, and the option in NO way addresses the cause of the heightened mental skills. Instead, if this option had attacked the cause rather than the effect, then it would weaken too. For example, if it said: “The tasks defining social interaction compiled by the study were more akin to mathematics problems than to social interaction” then this option would then reveal that there is a totally different cause other than social interaction.\n\n\n\nThe key to understanding why option B weakens the argument requires paraphrasing the conclusion, and taking that paraphrase an extra step (and that’s the core reason why this question is up there on the difficulty spectrum):\n\nThe argument is essentially saying that social interaction boosts mental sharpness. \n\n ➧ . \n\nSo option B is introducing this Medical Conditions and Treatments  that impacts both social interaction and mental sharpness. So it's not that social ➧ mental, they go hand in hand attributable to another cause, thereby weakening the argument.\n\nA tricky one!

We now know that Earth revolves around a star at the outskirts of a spiral arm of one of countless galaxies. Therefore, people’s old belief that Earth and its inhabitants were important was false.\n\nA flaw in the essayist’s argument is that the argument\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This question exhibits a commonly-repeated flaw on the LSAT: Disproof of an  being taken as disproof of that argument’s . Just because an argument is bad doesn’t mean that the argument’s conclusion can’t still be correct.\n\nAn example of this flawed thinking would be, “The cops planted the bloody glove, therefore OJ did not actually commit the crime.” I agree that the cops ruined their case against OJ through their misconduct, and I think it’s right that OJ therefore walks, because we need to discourage future police misconduct. But the fact that some of the evidence was shown to be faulty does not prove that OJ didn’t commit the crime. A rock-solid alibi would  he didn’t do it. A videotape of someone else doing the crime would prove he didn’t do it. Unfortunately for OJ, he doesn’t have either of these, and all other evidence suggests he is insane. The most likely scenario seems to be that the cops are crooked, the prosecutors were weak, and OJ, nevertheless, did actually do it. \n\nAnother example of this concept would be something like, “It’s raining outside, therefore San Francisco is in California.” This argument is horrible. The only premise (“it’s raining outside”) has nothing to do with the conclusion. But a terrible argument doesn’t disprove its own conclusion: the conclusion of the argument can still be correct.\n\nA) I don’t think the argument does this, partially because I don’t even know what it means. I’m hoping to find something that I can understand, and that matches my predicted flaw.\n\nB) Yep. This is a good description of the flaw of taking disproof of  to mean disproof of that argument’s conclusion, so it’s almost certainly the correct answer.\n\nC) What? This is nonsensical. There can be all sorts of good reasons for disbelieving a true statement. Example: If you were OJ’s friend, but you didn’t know he was completely crazy, then maybe you wouldn’t believe the prosecutor when he told you OJ did it, even though in retrospect you’d have to agree that he obviously did it. Anyway B was exactly what I predicted, so I don’t need to waste any more time on C.\n\nD) Is it even a  that people’s perception of their importance changed from century to century? I’m not sure it is. Anyway this isn’t what I was looking for. B is still the leader.\n\nE) Again, I’m not sure this is a fact we were provided. And I’m also not sure it’s relevant.\n\nOur answer is B.\n\nThis was a relatively easy question if you’ve seen the flaw a few times, but could be a very difficult question if you haven’t seen it before. The answer choices here are confusing, so if you don’t have an idea what you’re looking for you’re probably in really big trouble.

        "question": "Ramirez: The film industry claims that pirated DVDs, which are usually cheaper than legitimate DVDs and become available well before a film's official DVD release date, adversely affect its bottom line. But the industry should note what the spread of piracy indicates: consumers want lower prices and faster DVD releases. Lowering prices of DVDs and releasing them sooner would mitigate piracy's negative effect on film industry profits.\n\nThe argument above relies on which of the following assumptions?\n",
        "answer": "Edited the question.",
        "explanation": "Really good question that kind of strikes at the heart of what makes Assumption questions so interesting (and difficult).  With assumptions (and I'll demonstrate why in a second):\n\n1) It's really, really rare that extreme/universal words like all, only, never, etc. are required assumptions.  \n\n2) The correct answer / required assumption is usually much more subtle than what a great Strengthen answer would be, so you have to treat Assumption questions differently.\n\n3) This is where the Assumption Negation Technique can be so useful in helping show why points 1 and 2 are so important.\n\nHere notice that choice (A) has that extreme/universal language \"would not cause any reduction\" in revenue from theatrical release. Say that that were not true, and there were at least *some* reduction in the theatrical revenue.  A negated choice (A) would read:\n\n  reduction in the revenue the film industry receives from the films' theatrical release.  people who would otherwise purchase pirated DVDs would be willing to purchase legitimate DVDs if they were less expensive and released earlier than they are now. of the argument: without it, the argument is worthless.\n\nThat's why Assumption Negation is so powerful: by considering the opposite of an answer choice, you get to:\n\n1) Determine whether you really need that assumption or not.  If without it you know for sure the argument is powerfully damaged, then that assumption was required (like with B).  If without it you can't really tell whether the argument still works or not, it wasn't essential to the argument in the first place.\n\n2) Turn fairly \"soft\" Assumption answers (like \"some people...\" in B) into powerful Weaken answers.  Assumptions are really easy to make...correct answers don't often jump off the screen to you as \"oh yeah that one is absolutely right.\"  But good Weaken answers often *do* jump off the screen.  Assumption Negation allows you to turn hard Assumption questions into easy/moderate Weaken questions.\n\n3) See why extreme/universal words like \"all\" or \"none\" are so infrequently required by an argument.  The opposite of \"all\" is \"not all,\" and even if not all, but most, people behave a certain way, the argument tends to still work.  But the opposite of \"some\" is \"none\" and as you can see with (B) if you turn \"some people\" to \"no one\" an argument can crumble really quickly.  All/none are great Strengthen/Weaken words but not great Assumption words, since you rarely ever need such extremes as required information for an argument to hold up.",

Of over two hundred planets that astronomers have detected around other stars, almost all are hundreds of times larger and heavier than the earth and orbit stars much smaller than the sun.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, would most weaken the above justification of the claim that earthlike worlds form a low percentage of the total number of planets?\n",

Isn't it supposed to be trying to detect earth-like planets? \n\nMoreover, the  explanation for why A is incorrect includes \"More importantly, though, note that the conclusion is restricted to planets orbiting stars in our galaxy. There is nothing in this answer choice to suggest that the planets it refers to are actually in our galaxy.\" \nWhere does the passage explicitly narrow in on our galaxy, and exclude other galaxies? explanation I'm not at all convinced. A seems fair. A vs D is hard. They're so close.\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance I agree that some of these new questions are tricky! As usual, the exact language of the passage, question, and answer choices will help to eliminate the incorrect answers. \n\nLet's first take a look at the passage:\n for the claim. So, we are trying to weaken that particular piece of the passage, or the link between the justification and the passage's conclusion. weakens the justification -- this leaves open the possibility that  answer choices weaken the justification. We may need to eliminate the weaker weakeners (is your head spinning yet?), and keep the strongest weakener.\nTake a look at (A):\nTo clarify the meaning of this sentence, note that the things  astronomers have not attempted to detect planets are the \"stars\" mentioned earlier in the sentence. In other words, astronomers haven't attempted to detect planets around certain stars, and around these stars are millions of planets. \n\nAt a glance, this seems to weaken the force of the justification in the passage! Astronomers have only detected 200 planets, so perhaps these are not representative of the millions of other planets out there. Maybe a higher percentage of the not-yet-detected planets are earthlike, which would undermine the author's conclusion that a very low percentage of planets in the galaxy are small and earthlike. \n\nAfter a bit more thought, though (A) is a pretty  weakener (for the exact reason mentioned in the OE, which I'll try to explain a bit).\n\nThe author's conclusion is focused on the planets , while (A) just tells us that we haven't yet detected a bunch of planets out there somewhere in space. Maybe the 200 planets that were already detected are all within our galaxy, while the millions of undetected planets are outside of our galaxy. In this case, the justification in the passage would not be weakened very much, because the data from the 200 planets would be much more relevant to the conclusion than would the new information provided by (A). \n\nWe don't know for sure whether this is true, so we just have to keep in mind that (A)  weaken the justification provided in the passage, or it may not. \n\nNow take a look at (D):\nThe justification in the passage for the author's conclusion is that \"almost all\" of the 200 planets detected by astronomers are much  than the earth and orbit much  stars. From this, the author concludes that a very low percentage of planets in the galaxy are small/earthlike.\n\nBut wait -- what if astronomers just suck at detecting small/earthlike planets in the first place? Then the justification (that almost all of the detected planets are big) doesn't mean much. It just shows that we are good at detecting one kind of planet, and bad at detecting another. The link between the 200 detected planets and the conclusion is pretty much destroyed. \n\n(D), if true, makes the justification provided in the passage kind of worthless. (A), in comparison, is the weaker weakener -- because we don't know whether the millions of undetected planets are in our galaxy, we don't know how much it impacts the force of the passage's justification.\n\nFor this reason, (A) is out and (D) is the right answer.\n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

(Moreover, the condition that was used to prove that Space telescopes will replace earth telescopes, still holds good - even after mounting the telescopes on higher grounds, the distortion will not be eliminated, and hence the space telescopes still remain better of the two - nonetheless, this does not play any role in attacking the causal relation.)",

Therefore, any factory that has not installed such a system since last year must be emitting pollutants below the required level.\n\nThe reasoning above exhibits a flaw similar to one in which of the following?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "in prizes such as Courses, Tests, Private Tutoring, \n        \n        \n    \n\n­\n\n\n\nThe original argument has a flaw - looking at factories in a very simplistic and naive way. It assumes that the only reason a factory would not install an advanced filtration system is that it emits pollutants below the required level. This argument overlooks other potential reasons for not installing the filtration system, such as the factory being closed, exempt or emitting pollution illegally,  for example.\n\nE assumes that the only possible way for someone to be a professional athlete is if they have undergone drug testing, ignoring other potential scenarios, such as a professional athlete who hasn't been tested yet due to timing, oversight, or other reasons. This mirrors the flawed logic in the original argument, where the absence of a filtration system was taken as proof of compliance.\n\n\n\n\nWe know that this is a logical statement; if being cold-blooded is a necessary condition for being a reptile, then not being cold-blooded correctly excludes an animal from being a reptile. There is no flaw in the reasoning. Eliminate.\n\n\n\nThis answer choice has a sufficiency flaw - assuming that one condition is enough while others are present. Kind of like every square is a rectangle but not every rectangle is a square.  In this case, assuming that passing the test automatically means Jorge has a license, ignoring other necessary conditions like age or legal documentation or the fact that the license could have been revoked. This is a different line of reasoning. Eliminate\n\n\n\nSimilar to A, this choice spells out a requirement and then arrives to a logical conclusion based on that requirement. Cannot indicates an ability - this is a subtle difference from \"is not an elected official\" and is also different from \"if someone does not reside in the district, they must not be an elected official\" (which is more in line with the logical flaw above). There is no flaw in the reasoning as written, however. Eliminate.\n\n\n\nThis answer choice introduces a different flaw - a cause and effect and also a very bizare relationship of increase in customs officers reducing the number of people entering the country. No idea why it would happen as it is illogical. We can eliminate it.­\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "(A)The first step in this Parallel Reasoning question is to abstract from the specifics of the stimulus. In general terms, the stimulus provides a case in which a statement uttered in response to a particular situation is attacked as an ineffectual response; there are only two possible scenarios, and both expose the futility of the statement (if the original position is wrong, the given response would make matters look worse; if the position is right; the response does nothing to prove it). The parallel choice we’re looking for should therefore show that a given response shouldn’t be used because, whether the party under attack is right or wrong, the response is ineffective. We don’t have to look far. (A) says that when a practice has been denounced, it shouldn’t be defended by saying, “this is how we’ve always done it.” The reason for this is exactly parallel to the original’s “lose-lose” element: if the practice is a poor one, the response makes matters look even worse; if the practice is wise, the answer doesn’t provide good support for it. (A) fits the stimulus form to a T.\n\n(B) Unlike the stimulus, there’s no issue of the initial opinion being right or wrong. Instead of being presented with two cases where a person who eats strange foods is wrong or right to do so, we’re given two ways the response will sound unsatisfying.\n\n(C) also begins with a response people shouldn’t make, but instead of showing why the justification is pointless in the cases of the person being right and being wrong, the argument attacks the response for avoiding the issue.\n\n(D) again fails to show why the scholars’ response is no good whether they are right or wrong, implying instead that they are probably partly right and partly wrong.\n\n(E) fails because it recommends two better ways of responding (admission of error or silence), whereas the stimulus was primarily interested in describing why the original response was no good whether the original statement was right or wrong.",

          "A practice that has been denounced as a poor practice should not be defended on the grounds that “this is how we have always done it.” If the practice is a poor one, so much the worse that it has been extensively used; if it is not a poor one, there must be a better reason for engaging in it than inertia.",

Some critics claim this measure would increase wages and thus exacerbate our province's budget deficit. But in fact, it would probably reduce the deficit. The province immediately north of ours allows such union bargaining, and its budget deficit is lower than our province's—and lower than it was before the province allowed union bargaining.\n\nThe editorial's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which of the following grounds? \n",

At the same time, there could be many other factors that underlie the difference in budget deficits. So, the cause of the difference may not be that one province allows union bargaining whereas the other doesn't.\n\n\n\nEven this outcome could be the result of many factors other than allowing union bargaining.\n\nIn general, the fact that a province allows union bargaining and has a lower deficit doesn't necessarily mean that the first is the cause of the second.\n\nSo, we can see that, having used that evidence to support the conclusion, the argument is vulnerable to the criticism that \"It fails to adequately address the possibility that many factors affect provincial budget deficits.\"\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThis choice is incorrect because the argument simply doesn't do what it describes.\n\nAfter all, the argument doesn't make a similar claim about the other province: it doesn't make the claim that a measure to allow union bargaining in the other province probably will, in the future, reduce the other provinces's deficit.\n\nAlso, the argument doesn't confuse any claims with each other.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is counterfactual.\n\nAfter all, the argument actually says, \"The province immediately north of ours allows such union bargaining, and its budget deficit is ... lower than it was before the province allowed union bargaining.\"\n\nThe stated fact that the budget deficit of province immediately to the north is lower than it was before the province allowed union bargaining means that the budget deficit of province immediately to the north was higher before it allowed union bargaining.\n\nSo, the argument clearly does not overlook \"the possibility that the budget deficit of the province immediately to the north was higher before that province allowed the union bargaining.\"\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe argument does not involve the conclusion or require the assumption that \"if the measure reduces the budget deficit, then it will not increase wages of government employees.\"\n\nAfter all, the argument works as long as the measure would reduce the deficit, regardless of what else goes on.\n\nSo, it doesn't take the idea mentioned by this choice for granted since it doesn't involve or rely on that idea.\n\nEliminate.\n \n\n\nThis choice is incorrect because the argument simply doesn't do what it describes.\n\nAfter all, the argument doesn't involve any \"value judgment that the measure should be enacted.\" Rather, it simply makes a claim about the measure's likely consequences without getting into any value judgment.\n\nEliminate.\n\n A­",

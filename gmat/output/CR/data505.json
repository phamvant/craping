        "question": "Recent photographs of the planet Venus reveal long lines that appear to be the result of massive streams of lava from volcanic eruptions.

So, we can use the Yes/No test.\n\n\n\nRegardless of whether craters formed by meteor impacts on Venus could have made some of the lines shorter than they originally were, the lines are still longer than 200 miles.\n\nSo, the evidence supports the conclusion regardless of whether this choice is true.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nNotice that regardless of whether this choice is true and that, therefore, there must have been volcanoes on Venus, it's still the case that the lines are too long to have originated from lava flows given the temperature of Venus.\n\nIn other words, neither the statement that yes, the photographs of Venus reveal some mountain peaks that could only have been formed by volcanic eruptions or the statement that no, the photographs of Venus did not reveal some mountain peaks that could only have been formed by volcanic eruptions has any effect on the argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nNotice that, regardless of whether this choice is true and that, therefore, there are active volcanoes on Venus, it's still the case that the lines are too long to have originated from lava flows given the surface temperature of Venus.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nNotice that, regardless of whether this choice is true, the lines do extend father than lava would flow in the temperature on Venus.\n\nIn other words, neither the statement that yes, mountain ranges might have prevented lava flows from extending farther than they would have or the statement that no, mountain ranges would not have prevented lava flows from extending farther than they would have has any effect on the argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nLet's try the Yes/No test with this choice.\n\n\nThat statement weakens the argument by showing that the lines could have originated from lava flows when Venus was hotter. After all, if the surface of Venus was substantially closer to the temperature at which lava melts than it is now, then lava could have flowed much further than it would now.\n\n\nThat statement strengthens the argument by showing that, when the lines formed, Venus was not hotter than it is now. That information helps to confirm that the lines did not originate from lava flows.\n\nSo, if this choice is true, we have a weakener and, if this choice is not true, we have a strengthener.\n\nTherefore, determining whether this choice is true would help in evaluating the argument.\n\nThe correct answer is (E).",

        "question": "­A fast-food restaurant recently gave customers the option of entering their orders on a computer instead of speaking to an employee. When customers order by computer, it displays a list of additional items and suggests ordering them. During the first month, computer orders contained, on average, 10 percent more items than did orders placed directly with employees. Clearly, therefore, the computer display influences customers to order more items than they otherwise would.\n\nWhich of the following would it be most useful to establish for the purpose of evaluating the argument?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "­\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for the conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nWe see that the reasoning of the argument is basically that, since there is a positive correlation between \"more items and \"computer orders,\" it must be that the computer display causes customers to order more items than they otherwise would.\n\n\n\nThis is an Evaluate question. So, the correct answer will be such that different answers to the question it presents will weaken or strengthen the argument.\n\n\n\nNeither a yes nor a no answer to the question presented by this choice affects the strength of the argument.\n\nAfter all, comfort with placing an order and size of orders are two different things. So, even if some customers who placed orders with employees did not feel comfortable placing an order by computer, that fact would not be an alternative explanation for the difference in order sizes. After all, being uncomfortable placing an order by computer would not cause a customer to order less in dealing with an employee.\n\nSo, regardless of how we answer the question presented by this choice, the argument is unaffected.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nKnowing this would help with evaluating the argument.\n\nAfter all, if the answer is \"Yes,\" then we have an alternative explanation for the fact that \"computer orders contained, on average, 10 percent more items than did orders placed directly with employees.\" In that case, it could be that, rather than the computer display causes people to order more, people who already plan to order more use the computer.\n\nSo, a yes answer to the question presented by this choice would weaken the argument by indicating that something other than the display causing people to order more could be going on.\n\nOn the other hand, a no answer to this choice would serve to rule out the possibility that the reason why orders made by computer are larger is simply that people who plan to order more use the computer and thus help to confirm the conclusion.\n\nSo, knowing whether people who planned to order a large number of items were more likely than others to order by computer would be helpful in evaluating the argument.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThe answers to the question presented by this choice affect the case for the wrong conclusion.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument we're considering is \"the computer display influences customers to order more items than they otherwise would.\" On the other hand, the answers to the question presented by this choice would help with evaluating a conclusion about the profitability of using the computer.\n\nSince the conclusion whose support we're evaluating is specifically about order size and not about profitability, the answers to the question provided by this choice have no effect on the argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nSince what kitchen employees could tell about an order would not affect how much the customer would order, the answers to the question presented by this choice are irrelevant.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe answer to the question presented by this choice might seem relevant since it would provide additional detail on how how ordering using the computer works, which could conceivably be related to the size of orders.\n\nAt the same time, we have no reason to believe that pressing keys, touching a display, or speaking would cause customers to order more than they otherwise would, and it remains the case that the orders made by computer are larger. So, regardless of what the answer to the question presented by this choice is, the fact that orders made by computers are larger supports the conclusion that \"the computer display influences customers to order more items than they otherwise would.\"\n\nSo, knowing what this choice mentions would not help with evaluating the argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n B",

        "question": "30% of the residents of Tafta City own cars. However, 70% of the residents of Hampton, a suburb in Tafta City, are car owners. So. it can be concluded that the total number of cars owned by residents of Hampton exceeds the total number of cars owned by the rest of the residents of Tafta City.\n\nThe answer to which of the following questions would be most important in determining whether the above conclusion is correct?\n\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Neat question that plays with percentages. To truly evaluate the argument, we need to figure out a relationship between the actual number of people in Tafta and Hampton. Percentages can be very misleading. Suppose you have Frim A, whose revenues have grown 100% from last year, and Firm B, whose revenues have grown 5%. Which has the higher revenue? Obviously it depends on the actual value, and not just the percentage. Firm A could have a revenue of 10, which grew to 20, and Firm B could have a revenue of 100 million, which grew to 105 million. \n\nA) While this would be useful to know, from that information alone it is not possible to figure out what percentage of residents live in Hampton. For example, Tafta could have 100 residents, and of those residents, 10 live in Hampton. Or, Tafta could have 100 residents, and 80 live in Hampton. \n\nB) This is the correct option. If it is known what percentage of the population of Tafta lives in Hampton, we can determine if the number of cars owned in Hampton is greater than the number of cars owned in Tafta. Since we only have the percentage, it may be misleading. Consider a situation where, there are 100 residents of Tafta, which means that there are 30 owned cars in Tafta. Depending on where those 30 car owners live, it could mean that Hampton has more or less car owners than Tafta. For example, if only 10% of Tafta lives in Hampton, then that would mean 10 residents in Hampton, and only 7 car owners. Clearly then, the other areas have more car owners. But if 30% of Tafta lived in Hampton, that would mean 30 residents in Hampton, of which 21 would be car owners. Clearly then, Hampton has more car owners than the rest. \n\nC) Again, this may be interesting information but it is not required or sufficient for evaluating the argument. \n\nD) This is similar to A. Even if we know the total number of people living in Hampton, there is no way to determine the number of people living in Tafta, which makes D not sufficient for evaluating the argument. \n\nE) This is out of scope. The focus of the argument is not about cars purchased in or outside of Tafta cities, but the number of car owners in Hampton and the number of car owners in other areas of Tafta.",

        "question": "Recent editorials have called for limits on the amount of homework assigned to children. They point out that free-time activities play an important role in childhood development and that large amounts of homework reduce children’s free time, hindering their development. But the average homework time for a ten year old, for example, is little more than 30 minutes per night. Clearly, therefore, there is no need to impose the limits these editorials are calling for.\n\nWhich of the following is an assumption on which the educational theorist’s argument relies?\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Assumption questions are best approached with a kind of \"shield\" mentality.  They are often difficult to predict (unlike more traditional strengthen/weaken questions, which you should try to make some kind of a prediction on).  When reviewing the answer choices for these kinds of questions, you can typically rule out a few pretty quickly due to being out of scope.  In this question I would say that A and E are the quick throwaway answers.  A - there is no need to distinguish between which free-time activities are better than others, or how they are different, as the argument in no way depends on that; and E - we are discussing general child development, not development only as it pertains to academic work.\n\nWhen you are then narrowing down between the final couple answer choices, you can use what Veritas refers to as the \"assumption negation technique.\"  You negate a possible answer choice, and then insert it back into the argument as an additional premise, and kaboom - the argument implodes.  I view it as pulling out the \"jenga piece,\" that final piece you pull when you lose the game of Jenga as the blocks come tumbling down.\n\nHere the argument is:\nContext) Free time activities play an important role in childhood development.  Excessive homework reduces time for free time activities and therefore hinders their development\nPremise) The average homework time for a 10 year old is only 30 minutes per night\nConclusion) There is no need to place limits on the homework assignments assigned to children\n\nNegating the answer choices, \nB - Regularly doing homework assignments does NOT improve academic performance: this does not crush the argument.  If anything it actually strengthens the argument when negated, so is definitely not what I want\nC - Individual teachers ARE the best judge of how much homework to assign: Again, if anything it strengthens the argument when negated.  If teachers are the best judges, then that would further the argument that there is no need to place a limit.\nD - In most schools, if not all, the homework assignments given are of a length that DOES diverge widely from the average: here's our winner.  If we insert that back into the argument, then it basically nullifies the premise that the average homework time is only 30 minutes.  It shows that there may be many schools that have 0 homework, and then some that have 3 hours of homework/night.  The schools with 3 hours of homework/night are greatly hampering the children's development, and therefore there probably should be a limit placed.\n\nI hope this helps!",

        "question": "When unemployment rates are high, people with full-time jobs tend to take fewer and shorter vacations. When unemployment rates are low, people tend to vacation more often and go away for longer periods of time. Thus, it can be concluded that full-time workers’ perceptions of their own job security influence the frequency and duration of their vacations.\n\nThe argument above assumes that\n\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The word “assumes” in the question stem is a clear indication of an Assumption question.\n\n\n\n“Thus” signals the argument’s conclusion. You could paraphrase it as follows: how much vacation time full-time workers take depends on how secure they feel in their jobs. The author’s evidence for this conclusion is the relationship between vacations and unemployment. When unemployment is high, workers take fewer and shorter vacations; when unemployment is low, the opposite happens.\n\n\n\nTo find the central assumption, use Critical Thinking to link the terms in the evidence with the terms in the conclusion. If the evidence centers on employment levels and vacations, and if the conclusion centers on job security and vacations, then the central assumption must center on the connection between employment levels and job security.\n\n\n\nChoice (D) matches this prediction perfectly by bridging the terms of the evidence with the terms of the conclusion. The Denial Test can help confirm (D) as the correct answer; if there were no relationship between workers’ perceptions of job security and the unemployment rate, then it would no longer make sense for the author to use evidence about the unemployment rate to support a conclusion about workers’ perceptions of job security. (D) is an assumption necessary for the argument to hold.\n\nThe other choices are all incorrect in some definable way. It’s great practice to identify exactly why each wrong choice is wrong. Doing so will help you develop your Pattern Recognition skills so you can identify common wrong answer types on Test Day. (A) is too extreme (“no fear of losing their jobs”) to be the necessary assumption. (B) introduces the idea of travel costs, which are far outside the scope of the stimulus and have no necessary connection to job security in the conclusion. (C) similarly steps outside the scope; whether those people who work full-time jobs prefer to work them is irrelevant. (E) tells us that workers’ perceptions of their job security have deteriorated lately, but that has no necessary connection to the unemployment rate. Remember that the assumption must successfully link the evidence to the conclusion. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

Since the thermal device will utilize the same symbol system as Braille, it follows that anyone who is accustomed to reading Braille can easily adapt to the use of this electronic system.\n\nWhich of the following is an assumption on which the conclusion depends?\n\n\n(A) Braille is the only symbol system that can be readily adapted for use with the new thermal screen.\nThe use of ONLY is extreme. Does the conclusion really depend on this? Don't think so.\n\n(B) Only people who currently use Braille as their sole medium for reading text will have the capacity to adapt to the use of thermal screen.\nThe conclusion says those who are ACCUSTOMED to reading Braille will be able to easily adapt. This answer choice filters that down to those who only read text using Braille. Out.\n\n(C) People with the tactile ability to discriminate symbols in Braille have an ability to discriminate similar patterns on a flat heated surface.\nFits well. Try the negation technique and it's clear we need this.\n\n(D) Some symbol systems encode a piece of text by using dots that replicate the shape of letters of the alphabet.\nThe use of SOME should make you a bit wary, I daresay, but overall this is fairly irrelevant I'm sure to the conclusion. (C) is a much better choice.\n\n(E) Eventually it will be possible to train people to read Braille by first training them in the use of the thermal screen.\nIrrelevant to what we're looking for. The conclusion is about ADAPTing to Braille on a thermal screen, not TRAINING people to read Braille by first training them in the use of a thermal screen.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t -  -  -   - quick tip: there's a free auto-booking feature on the gmatknight site for a 15-min consult :)",

        "question": "­Analyst Claim: The sales and pre-orders of electric cars in urban areas will significantly increase this year. The primary reason for this increase is that ongoing improvements in battery technology have substantially lowered the cost of electric cars, making them more affordable for city dwellers.\n\nWhich of the following is an assumption made in drawing the conclusion above?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "in prizes such as Courses, Tests, Private Tutoring, \n        \n        \n    \n\n­\n\n\n\nThis choice validates the conclusion that the decrease in cost due to improved battery technology will lead to higher sales and pre-orders. The argument assumes that cost is a significant factor for city dwellers when purchasing vehicles because if cost savings were not the primary motivation, then the decrease in price would not lead to an increase in consumption as predicted.\n\n\n\nThis choice does not relate to the claim about cost reduction leading to increased sales and pre-orders of electric cars. This is largely irrelevant as there is no connection with the original argument. Eliminate.\n\n\n\nThis answer choice does not have anything to do with sales and costs of electric cars. Irrelevant. Eliminate.\n\n\n\nThere are a few problems with this answer choice:\n- First, it suggests that the reason consumers would purchase more electric cars is that they are more cost-efficient than gas cars. We don’t know if the cost advantage vs. gasoline cars is a major factor in the decision.\n- Second, and the biggest issue with this answer choice is that unstable gas prices (opposite) does not mean a decrease or negative. The price may rise and make electric cars even more financially advantageous or vice versa.\nThird, this answer choice is about the operating costs vs. what the argument told us that the cost of cards has declined. There are 2 elements to owning a car: upfront cost and operating cost. We do not know if the operating costs are a big driver for urban dwellers. I think it would be logical to assume that they are but it is not clear from the passage how significant they are.\n- Finally, we still need the answer choice C to be true (that city dwellers are motivated by savings when choosing a car) to make D work. So C is a better choice. Eliminate D.\n\n\n\nThis is about supply meeting demand and since the text talks about sales and pre-orders (which may extend far into the future), we can eliminate this answer choice. ­\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

Hence how can you say the publishers are discriminated against\nyour poems?\n\nWhat does this publisher's conclusion-reply mean?\n\nNo name on the poem = editor cannot identify author = editor cannot be prejudiced against an unknown author = publishing house and methods are fair = no unfair discrimination against Harry\n\nThat rendition is huge. Too huge. To make the argument more manageable I ask, \n\n\"What logical gap exists? Which reasoning is faulty? Which connection among the above connections is too extreme, too speculative, too short-sighted, or too  if I just think about it for a moment?\"\n\nLook carefully at the \"equals\" signs. The last three have logic that is pretty clean and not stupid.\n\nThis one, however, is extreme, short-sighted, and stupid:   \n\nStripped down: a visible name on a poem is the one and only way to recognize the author of a poem. \n\nNonsense. A poet can be recognized by a distinctive voice. (Neruda. Shakespeare. Dickinson.)\n\nThink about a distinctive singing voice such as Adele's. If Adele puts out a new song on the radio, we identify the singer as Adele before the DJ names her because Adele's voice is distinctive.\n\nExtrapolate. Good poets and artists of all kinds have a creative, idiosyncratic, and frequently recognizable  or \"signature.\"\n\nAssuming that there is only one way to identify the author of a poem is extreme. \n\nAs a result, if even ONE alternative way to identify the author of a poem is possible, then the claim that \"only names identify\" is false. \"ONLY\" is not only.  \n\nThe editor could easily recognize Harry's poems in another way. She could recognize Harry's distinctive style and voice in his poems.*\n\nThe publisher's reply logic hinges on the presence of names as the ONLY way to identify a poet (note the word \"hence\" in the publisher's conclusion). We need an option that mentions something about poems, names, identification of poems' authors, and the editor. \n\nThe publisher assumes that. . . \n\n(C) The poetry editor cannot recognize the poems submitted by Harry Trevalga as his unless Trevalga's name is attached to them.\n\nBingo. The publisher assumes that names are the ONE and ONLY way that the editor can recognize Harry's poetry. \n\nThat assumption is unwarranted. It is faulty. As a result, the conclusion is logically flawed.  \n\nThe assumption that the publisher makes in reply to Harry is\n\nAnswer C\n\n\n\nNegating (C)?  \"Unless\" is usually negated with \"even if.\" Negation in this case is not simple.\n\n(C) NEGATED: The poetry editor CAN recognize the poems submitted by Harry Trevalga as his EVEN IF Trevalga's name is NOT attached to them.\n\nTest this negated assumption. What happens to the conclusion?\n\nThe conclusion: Harry, you are incorrect about unfairness. When the editor reviews poems she never sees the authors' names. She cannot know who writes your poems [and cannot discriminate against someone whom she cannot identify].\n\nWith (C) negated, the conclusion is demolished. Negated (C) says that the editor CAN recognize Harry's poetry without a name. She CAN know who writes Harry's poems.\n\nIf the editor CAN recognize Harry's poems without his name per (C) negated, then she CAN discriminate against him. The publisher's conclusion just got eviscerated.\n\nAnswer C \n\n\n\nFair warning disclaimer: I do not think this analysis is a great idea. This approach is very nuanced. Further, double negatives in this case make this approach very dense. \n\"Unless\" indicates a necessary condition. \n\nX = recognize an author = Sufficient\nY = editor sees a name = Necessary\n\nE cannot do X unless Y\nE cannot do X without Y\nE can do X only if Y\n\nWe need to show that the necessary condition is not actually necessary.\n\nStated differently, we must find a way to show that the sufficient condition can happen even if the necessary condition does not happen.\n\nAttack the necessary condition. Find a way for the sufficient condition to occur without the occurrence of the necessary condition.\n\nThe conclusion insists that the editor cannot identify Harry's poems because she cannot see his name on his poems. Names are the necessary condition for the sufficient condition of recognizing Harry as the author of his poems. \n\nIs there another way that the editor can recognize Harry's poems without seeing his name? \n\nIf there is another way, then the allegedly necessary names are ... not necessary.\n\nMore directly (and rarely as obvious in LR questions as C is in this one): is it true that names are the only way to identify a poet? \n\nIf negated (see above), Answer C says that the editor CAN recognize Harry's poems without seeing Harry's name. \n\nWe do not know exactly what constitutes the alternative way to identify a poet. But negated C tells us that names are not the only way to identify a poet. \"Not the only way\" absolutely implies that there is another way.\n\nIf C is negated, names are not necessary. \n\nHence the sufficient condition CAN occur (authors of poems can be identified) \nEVEN IF the allegedly necessary condition (a visible name) does not occur \n(even if there are no names).\n\nNegated answered (C) gives us the sufficient condition  the \"necessary\" condition. The allegedly necessary condition is not actually necessary. \n\nAnd that not-actually-necessary condition is what the publisher assumed in reply to Harry.\n\nAnswer C\n\nHope that helps.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n— I stand with Ukraine:",

Mr. Craig's prize-winning lilies, however, were invaded by dodder, a parasitic plant, and every one of the lilies died soon after. Plainly, therefore, a parasite can be deadly.\n\nThe argument above depends on which of the following assumptions?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of the argument is the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for the conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nWe see that the reasoning of the argument is basically that, since these lilies died soon after being invaded by a parasitic plant, it must be the case that a parasite can be deadly.\n\nIn other words, the author has observed that one event, the death of the lilies, occurred after another, the invasion by dodder, and has decided that the first led to the second.\n\n\n\nThis is an Assumption question, and the correct answer will state something that must be true for the evidence in the argument to effectively support the conclusion.\n\n\n\nThis choice doesn't have to be true for the argument to work.\n\nAfter all, even if Mr. Craig did something to control the dodder, it still appears that the dodder killed the lilies. In fact, if Mr. Craig did do something to control the dodder, then the dodder appears to be even more deadly than it originally appeared since, even controlled, it still killed the lilies.\n\nSo, this choice doesn't state a necessary assumption.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is interesting.\n\nAfter all, if this choice is not true and Mr. Craig's lilies WERE infected with a virus deadly to lilies before being invaded by dodder, then the fact that the lilies died soon after being invaded by dodder doesn't effectively support the conclusion. After all, in that case, even though the lilies died soon after being invaded by dodder, it could very well be that the dodder was not deadly since it could be that the virus, rather than the dodder, killed the lilies.\n\nSo, for the argument to work, this choice has to be true.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nFor the conclusion that a parasite can be deadly to follow from the evidence, it has to be the that, at least in this case, the dodder WAS a parasite of lilies.\n\nSo, the argument certainly does not require the assumption that dodder is not a parasite of lilies, either in this particular case or \"usually.\"\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that, in general, parasites can be deadly.\n\nSo, the support for the conclusion doesn't require the assumption that lilies are a special case in that lilies are especially susceptible to being weakened by invading parasites.\n\nIn fact, the argument would be even more convincing if this choice were not true. After all, the fact that lilies are NOT especially susceptible to being weakened by invading parasites would make dodder seem even more deadly since, in that case, dodder appears to have killed plants that are not especially susceptible to being weakened by invading parasites.\n\nSo, this choice clearly is not an assumption on which the argument depends.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice has the wrong effect.\n\nIf what it says is true, it could be an explanation for why the lilies died after being invaded by the dodder. Perhaps, dodder doesn't usuallly kill lilies, but in this case, the dodder killed the lilies because it was unusually vigorous.\n\nThe issue is that we don't need an explanation. We need something that must be true for the evidence to support the conclusion.\n\nRegardless of whether the dodder was unusually vigorous, the fact that the lilies died soon after being invaded by the dodder appears to support the conclusion that a parasite can be deadly.\n\nSo, this choice does not state an assumption on which the argument depends.\n\nEliminate.\n\n B",

        "question": "Although there is no record of poet Edmund Spenser's parentage, we do know that as a youth Spenser attended the Merchant Tailors' School in London for a period between 1560 and 1570. Records from this time indicate that the Merchant Tailors' Guild then had only three members named Spenser: Robert Spenser, listed as a gentleman; Nicholas Spenser, elected the Guild's Warden in 1568; and John Spenser, listed as a \"journeyman cloth-maker.\" Of these, the last was likely the least affluent of the three—and most likely Edmund's father, since school accounting records list Edmund as a scholar who attended the school at a reduced fee.\n\nWhich of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Whenever I see assumption questions, I always start by figuring out exactly what the conclusion is, exactly in the author's own words. So in this case, the conclusion is basically a piece of the final sentence: \"John Spenser was... most likely Edmund's father.\" \n\nAnd what's the evidence to support the conclusion?\n\n\"Anybody\" is a pretty strong word here. We definitely don't need to assume that  who made clothing professionally was a member of the guild -- that's not going to help us prove that John Spenser was the father. Eliminate (A).\n\nSure, Edmund became a poet, but we definitely don't need to make any assumptions about his intentions while he attended the Merchant Tailors' School. Eliminate (B).\n\nThis is mildly tempting, I suppose: this reinforces the idea that Nicholas Spenser was probably affluent, and therefore less likely to be Edmund's father. But we don't need to assume that Nicholas was specifically a gentleman to draw the conclusion. Nicholas could easily have been wealthy -- or at least more affluent than John Spenser, the \"journeyman cloth-maker\" -- without actually being a gentleman. Eliminate (C).\n\nI don't see any reason why we need to make this assumption, either. Sure, it might be helpful to assume that ALL students at the school had fathers who were members of the Merchant Tailors' Guild: that way, one of the three men mentioned in the passage MUST be Edmund's father. But that's not what (D) says: it's just saying that most members of the guild sent their sons to the Merchant Tailors' School. And there's no reason why we need to assume that to reach the conclusion. Eliminate (D).\n\nI hope we like (E)...\n\nOh good, we have a winner. If (E) is true, then it's really unlikely the two more affluent Spensers -- Robert the gentleman and Nicholas the Guild Warden -- could have been the parent of young Edmund, who attended with reduced fees. We definitely need to know that the reduced fees actually meant that a student had a less-affluent father.

The argument doesn't depend on (A), so (A) is out.\n\nAgain, does this HAVE to be true? Maybe the main reason for replacing a personal computer is that people keep dropping their current models on the ground and breaking them.

In essence, it is just an assumption question. \nAn assumption is something that must be necessary for the argument. The author assumes it to be true. Whether it actually is true or not, we don't have to worry about it. This question stem is telling us that the assumption he has made may not be valid.  \n\nDon't confuse this with given premises. Since the author gives them as data to back his conclusion, we assume the premises to be true while evaluating the validity of his argument. \n\n\nArgument:\n\n“Fast cycle time” is a strategy of designing a manufacturing organization to eliminate bottlenecks and delays in production.  \nbottlenecks and delays cannot be eliminated unless all work is done right the first time.\n\nConclusion: Not only does it speed up production, but it also assures quality.\n \n\n(A) any flaw in work on a product would cause a bottleneck or delay and so would be prevented from occurring on a “fast cycle” production line\n\nThis is the missing link. It links quality (not mentioned in premises but concluded) to fast cycle. \nThe author is assuming that since the \"fast cycle\" eliminates bottle necks, it eliminates flaws too. The assumption is that flaws will cause a bottleneck. So removing bottlenecks means all flaws are taken care of. \n\n(B) the strategy of “fast cycle time” would require fundamental rethinking of product design\nIrrelevant. How we achieve fast cycle doesn't matter.\n\n(C) the primary goal of the organization is to produce a product of unexcelled quality, rather than to generate profits for stockholders\nIrrelevant. The argument discusses \"fast cycle time\" strategy. Whether organisations will use it or not, we don't have to worry. \n\n(D) “fast cycle time” could be achieved by shaving time off each of the component processes in production cycle\nHow it is achieved - whether time is shaved off from each process or from some specific processes - doesn't matter. \n\n(E) “fast cycle time” is a concept in business strategy that has not yet been put into practice in a factory\nWe don't know whether it has been put in practice.

The second provides support for the first, which leads the author to state that the hypoth is plausible.\n\n\n This argument has two conclusions.  The author’s conclusion is that the scientists’ hypothesis is not sheer speculation – it does have support.  The scientists’ conclusion/hypothesis is that boreal owls range over unusually large areas because of a scarcity of prey.\n\n Boreal owls range over unusually large areas when they live where food eaten by small mammals is relatively sparse.  Since this evidence supports the scientists, it also supports the author of the argument.\n\n The scarcity of small mammal food indicates a scarcity of small mammals.  It should be noted, however, that the author does not make a definite claim; it merely says that the scientists are not merely speculating.\n\n\nAs always, let’s check out the stance of the options to see which ones botch it.  The argument DEFINITELY does not oppose the hypothesis. In fact the author makes the case that the hypothesis is pretty reasonable.\n\nBetween A, B, and C, let’s see what’s going on with the back half of the options: \n\n It’s proof that the author finds promising. Chuck it.\n\nNow, between B, and C there’s more of a nuance, but . Nowhere in this prompt do we see any indication of an alternative hypothesis. Drop option C.\n\n  The first statement does provide a hypothesis; it hypothesizes an explanation for the wide range of boreal owls: scarcity of prey.  The second portion, while not definitive, does provide some support to the hypothesis, and the author acknowledges that this proof adds credence to the hypothesis. Since the owls range over larger areas when the food of small mammals is scarce, this might well be because the small mammals eaten by the owls are scarce.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTotal GMAT Content &amp; Tactical Training | 120 Point Guarantee | All 6 Official GMAT Tests\nempowergmat.com",

The problem is that although no airline company has announced a higher priority for safe seating, this does not mean that airlines are not doing so. They could be choosing not to announce this and internally making a decision to re-prioritize.\n\nC. This would support the argument. The reason is because if the price of fuel is higher this year, that means costs will be higher.

We are not concerned with the increase in the cost of materials.\n\nE. This is the correct answer.

        "question": "A study of marital relationships in which one partner's sleeping and waking cycles differ from those of the other partner reveals that such couples share fewer activities with each other and have more violent arguments than do couples in a relationship in which both partners follow the same sleeping and waking patterns. Thus, mismatched sleeping and waking cycles can seriously jeopardize a marriage.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument above?\n\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The conclusion is that \"mismatched sleeping and waking cycles can seriously jeopardize a marriage.\"\n\nHow does the author arrive at this conclusion?\n\nThe author does not claim that mismatched sleep cycles are the ONLY cause of arguments that can jeopardize a marriage. Partners with the same sleeping/waking patterns might also have serious arguments, but does having mismatched sleep cycles lead to an increase in violent arguments? Choice (A) doesn't suggest otherwise, so it does not weaken the argument. Eliminate (A).\n\nThe sleep cycles of BOTH partners could follow the same seasonal patterns. So regardless of whether (B) is true, couples may or may not follow the same sleeping and waking patterns.\n\nDo mismatched sleeping/waking cycles jeopardize marriages? Seasonal variability doesn't strengthen or weaken the argument, so eliminate (B).\n\nThe argument is concerned with  in which one partner's sleeping and waking cycles differ from those of the other partner. We don't care about the effect of mismatched sleep cycles on the professional relationships of individuals in those marriages. We only care about how their MARRIAGES are affected. Eliminate (C).\n\nThe study shows that couples with mismatched sleeping/waking cycles share fewer activities with each other and have more violent arguments than do couples in a relationship in which both partners follow the same sleeping and waking patterns. But does that necessarily mean that mismatched sleep cycles CAUSE a decrease in shared activities or an increase in violent arguments?\n\nWhat if the hostility CAUSES the mismatched sleeping/walking cycles? Choice (D) suggests that the mismatched sleep cycles are a  of the unhappiness and hostility, not the  of the problems. In that case, instead of mismatched sleep cycles leading to marriage problems, marriage problems lead to mismatched sleep cycles.\n\nThis reversed cause and effect relationship weakens the idea that mismatched sleeping cycles can seriously jeopardize a marriage. (D) doesn't disprove the author's argument, but it certainly works against it. Keep (D).\n\nChoice (E) is tempting. This suggests that couples with mismatched sleep cycles might be able to do something to remedy their problems. But will such couples 1)  the source of their problems, 2) be willing to do something about it, and 3) be able to undo the damage that has already been done?\n\nWe have to consider the data cited in the passage, which links mismatched sleep cycles to more violent arguments and fewer shared activities. Even if it is  to remedy the mismatched sleep cycles, the data implies greater marriage trouble for couples with mismatched sleep cycles.\n\nEven though there is an easy way to modify sleeping/waking cycles, we still have a correlation between mismatched sleep cycles and marriage problems. Thus, it still seems reasonable to suggest that mismatched sleeping and waking cycles can seriously jeopardize a marriage. \n\nChoice (E) doesn't seriously weaken the argument, and (D) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

However, it is not a clear reason to wash fruit just before it is eaten.\n\nRather, it would be a reason to wash fruit after purchase or before storage with vegetables, presumably well before it is eaten.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe fact that raw fruit is perishable is not a reason to wash it just before it is eaten. After all, fruit would not \"perish,\" i.e., break down or decay, in the last few moments before it's eaten.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe fact that merchants are aware that microbes can be on fruit is not a clear reason to wash it just before eating it.\n\nThis fact may help to confirm that microbes are present and that there is a need to wash them off at some point, but we need a reason to wash them off just before fruit is eaten.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nNotice that this choice is about fruit that is \"stored.\"\n\nThis fact about fruit that is stored is not relevant to washing fruit that is not about to be stored but rather is about to be eaten.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice states a clear reason to wash fruit just before it is eaten.\n\nThough, as the passage says, \"Washing fruit in cold running water reduces the number of these microbes to levels where there are too few to harm anyone who ingests them,\" if this choice is true, then washing fruit even a few hours before it is eaten may not make it safe to eat. After all, by the time it is eaten, microbes on it may have multiplied to the point of reaching dangerous levels.\n\nThus, this choice provides a reason to wash fruit just before it is eaten, to reduce the number of microbes to safe levels without giving them time to multiply back to dangerous levels before the fruit is eaten.\n\nKeep.\n\n E",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Before considering the answer choices, let’s take a look at the structure of the politician’s argument:\n\n from the US to Mexico doubled the next year. from the US to Mexico doubled as a result of the reduction in tariffs.\nThe question then asks that we find an answer choice that logically completes the politician’s argument. In other words, why does the politician conclude that the increase in goods SHIPPED from the US to Mexico is not indicative of a equivalent increase in goods SOLD from the US to Mexico? With that in mind, let’s take a look at the answer choices:\n\n(A) merely indicates that many US companies have long-time competitors in Mexico. It doesn’t give any information as to whether these US companies were engaged in trade with Mexico. It’s also possible that other US companies did not have competitors in Mexico. Moreover, (A) gives no information as to how the dynamics between the competitors changed as the result of the reduction in tariffs. It’s likely that the reduction in tariffs would make US companies more competitive and thus, if anything,  their sales. Therefore, (A) does not provide support for the politician’s conclusion, and we can eliminate it.\n\nThe amount of US goods shipped to Mexico doubled in the year after tariff reduction. But if most of this increase was the result of US companies shipping to their own subsidiaries, which, in turn, shipped back to the US, then most of the goods were not SOLD to companies and consumers in Mexico. Rather, they were SHIPPED to US companies in Mexico, and the US companies then shipped the goods back to the US. In other words, most of the goods SHIPPED to Mexico were NOT actually ever SOLD in Mexico. This would explain why, despite appearances to the contrary, sales of US goods to companies and consumers in Mexico did not double in that year. Let’s keep (B).\n\nPresumably, the reduction in tariffs allows companies to market goods to previously unavailable customers. (C) tells us that these efforts are MOST successful when advertising has been in place for at least a year. But that does not mean that the marketing efforts could NOT be somewhat successful and result in double the goods sold. Moreover, there are other possible avenues to increase sales. For example, it’s possible that the companies increased their sales to existing customers in Mexico. So, (C) does not give sufficient reason to conclude that sales of US goods to Mexico did not double in that particular year. Eliminate (C).\n\nEven if the amount of goods shipped from Mexico to the US remained constant, we still know that the amount of goods shipped from the US to Mexico doubled. We’re concerned with whether that means that sales of US goods to Mexico also doubled. And (D) gives us no reason to doubt that. Eliminate (D).\n\nMany factors other than trade affect the employment rate. So, we can draw no conclusions about trade from the employment rate in both countries. Eliminate (E).\n\n(B) helps to explain why we cannot conclude that the sales of US goods to companies and consumers in Mexico doubled that year, and it is correct.\n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

So, the most reasonable question that ought to be studied is whether _____________.\n\nWhich one of the following most logically completes the passage?\n\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "The single sentence prior to the last sentence is lengthy and contains the information required to fill in the blank at the end of the question. The argument topic is language acquisition; the author indicates that “one cannot attribute such acquisition solely to environmental influences” and then immediately follows that phrase by saying “innate mechanisms also play a role.” Hence, the author feels that both environment and innate mechanisms play a role. The last sentence then prefaces the blank by saying, “the most reasonable question that ought to be studied is whether______.” The most logical answer would be one that addresses the relative roles played by environment and innate mechanisms in language acquisition. Let’s examine the answer choices: \n\nAnswer choice (A): The argument is not about whether language acquisition can ever be explained, but about what influences exist on language acquisition and to what degree. \n\nAnswer choice (B): The psychologist asserts this statement at the end of the first sentence and if this were a Must Be True question, this would be the correct answer. But, this is more than a Must Be True question and the correct answer must meet the Main Point criterion. So, although this answer choice is true according to the psychologist, it does not capture the point of the argument as indicated by the last sentence and is therefore incorrect. \n\nAnswer choice (C): The argument does not attempt to establish that language acquisition is solely the product of innate mechanisms, but that innate mechanisms have some influence, as does environment. This answer choice tries to confuse test takers by going in the opposite direction of the psychologist’s statement that “one cannot contribute such acquisition solely to environmental influences.” This does not mean that we can therefore attribute such acquisition solely to innate mechanisms. \n\nAnswer choice (D): “Parents and peers” would qualify as environmental influences and the argument is not about determining if the environmental influence is the most important factor, but about the relative roles played by environment and innate mechanisms in language acquisition. \n\n, and this is the only answer that addresses the relative roles of environment and innate mechanisms. Note that the language of the answer choice could have indicated that either play a greater role because what ought to be studied is a question that determines which is a greater influence.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

Thus, in high-yield years, growers often store part of their crop in refrigerated warehouses until after the next year's harvest, hoping for higher prices then.

Notice, first, that you are not really looking to strengthen or weaken the argument, but the framework of the question asks you to provide  for why . It is more of a  type of question. We know we are looking for the reason because the blank follows the word . Your assertion that  is not necessarily correct. If the growers had held back part of their yield, rather than saturate the market, then the price of what they did put up for sale might have remained higher than it would have been. The passage supports this notion:\n\n.\n\nYes, it is true that growers  for higher prices, but because of this very hope, it is clear that they cannot entirely control the market price of pecans. How about we take a look at the answer choices and see what we can eliminate?\n\n the pecan crop was as small as it was this year, the practice of holding back part of one year's crop had not yet become widely established, but with . Why would a lower crop yield from  not lead to higher pecan prices? This consideration does not provide any insight into the matter.\n \n was the  in recent years we are seeking. The supply of pecans from the crop of the last year is diminished, yet, once more, . How do we resolve the discrepancy? Just because prices have been stable in the recent past does  explain why they would continue to remain stable.\n \n were as high this year as they had been last year trap. We cannot qualify this vague count of farmers. How many were there? Two? Five? A million? The fact remains that, according to the passage, . Whether  growers produced similar yields is irrelevant: the overall yield of pecans is significantly lower. \n\n of this year's pecan crop is  of any pecan crop in the previous five years, then the growers might be able to charge more and meet similar sales figures from the past, but that could be the answer to a different question altogether. We need to explain why the lower yield would lead to a pecan price no higher than it had been a year ago. This answer requires a one-step-removed justification, i.e. that pecans of similar quality would command similar prices, but we need to explain why lower pecan yields will not drive up the price of pecans in a significant way.\n\nIn the end, only (B) resolves the paradox in a clear and direct manner, supportable by the information in the passage.

In consequence, Utrania oil exports dropped steadily as old fields became depleted. Utrania's currently improving economic condition, together with less restrictive regulations, will undoubtedly result in the rapid development of new fields. However, it would be premature to conclude that the rapid development of new fields will result in higher oil exports, because __________.\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The author would like to reach the following conclusion: \"it would be premature to conclude that the rapid development of new fields will result in higher oil exports.\" Let's consider what we have so far...\n\n a major petroleum exporter. The word \"formerly\" tells us that Utrania is no longer a  petroleum exporter. not increase even if new fields (new sources of oil) are rapidly developed. Notice that the author is not saying that the exports will DEFINITELY not increase. Rather, the author is merely suggesting that we don't know yet. In other words, it would be \"premature\" to conclude that the rapid development will result in higher oil exports.\n\n(And if you prefer your explanations in video form, check out .)\n\nThe author expects the supply of oil to increase but does NOT expect exports to increase... why not? Perhaps if the price of oil were expected to plummet, it would not make economic sense to export the oil. But if the price of oil is expected to remain stable, we would expect an increase in supply to cause an increase in exports. Choice (A) does not explain this apparent discrepancy, so it can be eliminated.\n\nWe know that the new fields will help replenish the supply of oil, so why won't Utrania export that oil? Well, perhaps the demand for oil IN Utrania will increase. If the improvement in economic conditions causes a dramatic increase in automobile ownership, then we can expect an increase in domestic demand for oil to fuel those automobiles. So even though Utrania will be PRODUCING more oil, a larger chunk of that production will have to stay in Utrania to meet the increased domestic demand. This explains how supply could increase without an increase in exports, so hang on to choice (B).\n\nIt doesn't matter where the investment comes from. If we are rapidly developing new oil fields, we should increase the supply of oil. If we increase the supply of oil, why won't exports also increase? Choice (C) does not address this apparent discrepancy and can be eliminated.\n\nWe already know that the new fields will increase the supply of oil. Choice (D) gives us even MORE reason to expect that oil supplies will increase. Not only do we have the oil from the new fields, but we'll also be able to squeeze some more oil out of the \"depleted\" fields. This further suggests that exports will increase and does not explain the author's conclusion. Eliminate (D). \n\nChoice (E) might be tempting if it said that the new fields are NOT likely to be as productive as those developed when Utrania was a major exporter. If that were the case, we would have to doubt whether the rapid development would lead to a substantial increase in the supply of oil. However, as written, choice (E) simply gives us more reason to think that the new fields SHOULD lead to an increase in oil exports. This does not match the author's conclusion, so (E) can be eliminated.\n\nChoice (B) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "For many years, polls have shown that most American taxpayers fear the fines and late fees that can follow an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit. The move to fashion a friendlier public image for the IRS in order to increase the operating efficiency of the agency may be counterproductive because ____________________.\n\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "C\n\n\n\nQuestions that ask us to fill in a blank in a stimulus are Inference questions, since we must complete the author’s line of reasoning, based on the information given.\n\n\n\nIn this stimulus, the author states that the IRS’s attempt to be friendlier in order to increase its operating efficiency may be counterproductive. The author also cites polls indicating that a majority of taxpayers fear the fines and fees accompanying an IRS audit.\n\n\n\nIt’s up to us to determine why the IRS being friendlier could compromise its operating efficiency rather than enhance it. Even if we can’t predict the correct inference exactly, seeing the word “counterproductive” should make us look for an answer that shows why the new program will not work.\n\n\n\n(C) tells us that in order to ensure the timely collection of taxes, taxpayers need to have some fear of the IRS. If the IRS becomes too friendly and taxpayers no longer fear the IRS, then the timely collection of taxes will suffer. And that of course would defeat the IRS’s stated goal of increasing its operating efficiency. Therefore, (C) is correct. (A) introduces the idea of refund checks, which is far outside the scope and has no bearing on an argument about the IRS being able to collect taxes efficiently. (B) suggests that the IRS wouldn’t have to audit quite as much, since more people will cooperate. This would make the IRS’s plan quite successful, not counterproductive. As for (D), it’s irrelevant whether or not more people feared the IRS 10 years ago. If people still fear the IRS, then becoming friendlier may still be productive. (E) suggests that becoming friendlier wouldn’t necessarily help the IRS save money and efficiency, but it certainly doesn’t suggest that becoming friendlier might cost them anything, either. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "When a polygraph test is judged inconclusive, there is no reflection on the examinee.

Nevertheless, employers will sometimes refuse to hire a job applicant because of an inconclusive polygraph test result.\n\nWhich of the following conclusions can most properly be drawn from the information above?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Hey All,\n\nYou seem to have gotten to the right answer here without too much trouble, but for those who struggled, I'd like to remind you that this is a sub-category of CR questions called \"Draw a Conclusion\". The rules surrounding these types of questions are very straightforward: DO NOT MAKE ANY LEAPS OF LOGIC and DO NOT BRING IN YOUR OWN INFORMATION. Everything has to come from what's written (though it will always come paraphrased, so you can't play the \"matching game\").\n\nConclusion: No conclusion in Draw a Conclusion questions\n\nPremises: Inconclusive test fails to show truth or untruth. Some employers refuse to hire someone with an inconclusive test.\n\n1. Most examinees with inconclusive polygraph test results are infact untruthful.\nProblem: We aren't told anything about how often people do or do not lie, so we can't assume this.\n\n2. Polygraph tests should not be used by employers in the consideration of job applicants.\nProblem: Even though this seems like an entirely logical thing to conclude, given the evidence, it is too much of a leap. The passage DOES NOT tell us what should or should not happen in terms of the test.\n\n3. An inconclusive polygraph test result is sometimes unfairly held against the examinee.\nAnswer: There's no logical \"fair\" reason to refuse to employ someone with an inconclusive test, so we can assume this directly from what we've been told.\n\n4. A polygraph test indicating that an examinee is untruthful can sometimes be mistaken.\nAnswer: This is a great example of a \"previous knowledge\" trap. All of us know (from watching Law &amp; Order) that polygraph tests are not always correct. But is that mentioned anywhere in the passage? No.\n\n5. Some employers have refused to consider the results of polygraph tests when evaluating job applicants.\nAnswer: Much like D, this would be a logical thing to conclude in real life (some employers must choose to ignore these results if they know they don't tell you much).\n\nHope that helps!\n\n-t",

In addition, remember that we are not required to use all of the information presented in the premises, though the more information we can include, the better (as long as we don't take it too far!). \n\n(A) The passage says that grapefruit or grapefruit juice ingested within an hour will \"significantly\" diminish the effectiveness of the medication. This does not mean that grapefruit or grapefruit juice ingested more than an hour before the medication is ingested will have no effect on the medication; it may have a mild effect. \n\n(B) The passage speaks only of taking the medication after ingesting grapefruit; it says nothing about the effects of eating grapefruit after taking the medication. \n\n(C) The passage implies that the pain receptors that the specific medication works on are the pain receptors that are affected by grapefruit. This does not mean that these are the only pain receptors in the brain. \n\n The passage says that the medication has been shown to be less effective when taken after grapefruit consumption.

        "question": "Since 1995, Congress has exempted oil companies that have leases issued by the federal government allowing them to drill for deep-water oil off the Gulf of Mexico from royalty payments as an incentive to spur development in times of low oil and gas prices. These leases were supposed to have included a provision that reinstates the royalties should the market prices of oil and gas exceed a certain level. Because of an error by the federal government, however, the language that reinstates the royalties is missing from the more than 1,100 leases issued by the U.S. government in 1998 and 1999. Since the market price of oil and gas has recently risen far above the threshold levels, this error could allow the oil companies to reap a windfall of more than $10 billion through the life of the leases. In response, the government is pressuring the oil companies to renegotiate the leases. The executives of the oil companies strongly oppose renegotiation; all have issued statements stating that they expect the government to honor the terms of the contracts and that renegotiating a duly signed agreement would set a bad precedent.\n\nWhich of the following statements best reflects the position of the oil company executives?\n\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The oil executives argue that the leases should not be renegotiated because a duly executed contract should be strictly honored. The best answer choice will reflect this argument. \n\n(A) This is a tempting answer because the windfall from the government error is certainly an opportunistic event that is unlike to repeat itself. However, it does not reflect the argument that the oil executives have made justifying their opposition to renegotiating the leases and therefore is not the best answer. \n\n(B) The oil company executives would not agree with this answer choice: should the positions be reversed, they would certainly not want the government to hold \nthem to a contract that contains an error unfavorable to them. \n\n(C) While it is true that the taxpayers’ loss is the oil companies’ gain, this answer choice does not reflect the argument that the oil executives have made justifying their opposition to renegotiating the leases and therefore is not the best answer. \n\n The executives argue that the government should strictly honor the agreement already in place; i.e., they should not “change the rules in the middle of the game.” \n\n(E) While the unexpected windfall may indeed be “sweet” to the oil executives, getting “revenge” requires that some prior injustice was inflicted by the government upon the oil companies.

        "question": "Language development specialists have discovered that most children learn languages best before puberty. During the years leading up to puberty, children’s brains are capable of absorbing new languages with less effort than the brains of children who are post-pubescent. As a result, pre-pubescent children are able to think in a new language far more quickly than their post-pubescent counterparts, and children prior to puberty are also able to retain those languages more easily than if they learn the languages after puberty. Funding is limited for second language programs, so schools in this country tend to delay the study of modern languages until high school; but young children would benefit from second language programs in the elementary years.\n\nWhich of the following best summarizes the main point of the passage?\n\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Question asks the student to consider an argument about language development in children before puberty and to summarize the main point of the passage. Specifically, the passage begins by pointing out that specialists in language development know that pre-pubescent children learn languages better than post-pubescent children, as the brains of pre-pubescent children are more adapted to absorbing languages. The passage then points out that funding is generally limited for incorporating second language lessons to elementary children, so schools tend to delay the learning of second languages until high school, or after puberty. In order to discern the main point, the student must consider the purpose of these details, sorting out primary details and secondary details, and consider them in the context of the argument in the passage.. It is important to remember that the student is not necessarily being asked to restate the argument itself (that schools should teach second languages to pre-pubescent children), but to summarize the entire point of the passage in the context of the argument.\n\n\n\nE Answer choice (E) best combines all of the primary elements within the context of the argument to arrive at a main point: that because of children’s ability to absorb new languages before puberty, schools should adopt second language lessons for elementary-age children. Therefore, answer choice (E) is most correct.\n\n\n\nA Answer choice (A) summarizes the point of the details in the passage but does not place these details in the context of the argument being presented. The fact that children learn languages best before puberty is significant, but it needs to be placed alongside the argument about the importance of schools teaching second languages to pre-pubescent children. Answer choice (A) is incorrect, because it leaves out important elements of the passage.\n\nB The author of the passage does point out that there is not enough government funding for teaching second languages, but this point seems to be made within the context of why schools delay language classes until the high school years; it is not a primary detail. Therefore, answer choice (B) is not correct.\n\nC Answer choice (C) offers a secondary detail but does not place this detail within the bigger picture offered by the passage. It does not summarize the main point of the passage and can be eliminated at once. \n\nD Although the author of the passage does indicate clearly that children would greatly benefit from learning second languages in the elementary years, he does not pass judgment on schools that do not offer these programs. Instead, the author provides an explanation for why these programs do not exist, suggesting that such hindrances should be overcome. Answer choice (D) fails to summarize the main point of the paragraph, so it is incorrect.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "The city's public transportation system has been experiencing a significant decline in ridership over the past year. This decline has been attributed to the recent introduction of ride-hailing services, which have become increasingly popular among commuters. In response, the city has proposed a plan to increase the frequency and reliability of its public transportation system.

        "explanation": "In critical reasoning, our job is to read critically. \n\n(1/3) of subscribers to Financial Forecaster are millionaires, and over 1/2 are in top management.\nShouldn’t you subscribe to Financial Forecaster now?\n\nSo the first thing that comes to my mind is that they are trying to sell FF to me by giving these stats. They are implying that people who subscribe to FF become millionaires and top managers. If I were gullible, I would perhaps deduce this and subscribe to FF.\nBut what if people who become millionaires and top managers subscribe to FF afterwards because it gives them some info they need in their roles? Then my subscribing to FF is unlikely to make me a millionaire/top manager. \nNow I am happy with my analysis and move on to the question stem.\n\nA reader who is neither a millionaire nor in top management would be most likely to act in accordance with the advertisement’s suggestion if he or she drew which of the following questionable conclusions invited by the advertisement?\n\nSo I think about it like this - I will act as per the ad's suggestion (subscribe to the FF) if I conclude what from the ad?\n\nThis is simple! I know they are implying that people who subscribe to FF become millionaires and top managers. If I believe in this, I will subscribe to FF. This is mentioned in (D)\n\nAnswer (D)\n\nA. Among finance-related periodicals. Financial Forecaster provides the most detailed financial information.\nThis is not a conclusion that one can draw from the ad. Hence not correct.\n\nB. Top managers cannot do their jobs properly without reading Financial Forecaster.\nThis is the smart me thinking. That top managers subscribe to FF because they need to. They don't become top managers by subscribing to it. But what they are looking for is the conclusion of a gullible person. So not correct.\n\nC. The advertisement is placed where those who will be likely to read it are millionaires.\nAnother possibility of smart deduction. Perhaps the FF targets millionaires only and hence has millionaires as subscribers. But again, what they are looking for is the conclusion of a gullible person. So not correct.\n\nE. Only those who will in fact become millionaires, or at least top managers, will read the advertisement.\nAgain, this says that it caters to the cream of the society - people who are likely to become millionaires or top managers.

        "question": "Television programming experts maintain that with each 1% increase in the prime-time ratings of a television station there is a 3.5% increase in the number of people who watch its evening news program. However, in the last ten years at Channel NTR, there was only one year of extremely high prime-time ratings and during that year, fewer people than ever watched Channel NTR’s evening news program.\n\nWhich of the following conclusions can properly be drawn from the statements above?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "In the interest of assisting the community, I will provide my thoughts on this one. Our task here is to provide a logical conclusion. What does the passage tell us?\n\nSentence 1 provides the view of , who have noted a positive correlation between  and .\n\nSentence 2 starts with a contrast in , and the rest of the sentence delivers a counterexample to the claim from before. Over a ten-year period at Channel NTR, there was a single year of , but .\n\nThe positive correlation seems jeopardized, to say the least. So what can we necessarily conclude?\n\nThere are a few problems with this one. The most noticeable is that the arrow of correlation has been reversed. The experts in the beginning of the passage note that an increase in prime-time ratings occurs with a corresponding increase in viewers of the evening news program offered by the station. This answer choice places the news program first—not an automatic red flag, since the passage does not indicate conclusively that A  B, just that they increase together in a predictable manner—but it also removes the type of news program by dropping . This omission is the real dagger in the heart here, since we cannot make any predictions about the effect that just any sort of news program may have. We are interested in  news programs only. \n\nWe can properly deduce this from the information in the passage? I think not. The passage does not mention daytime news programs, so we cannot speculate on what the experts may have considered about them. For all we know, they did look at such data, but they did not find a correlation worth mentioning. \n\nThe specificity of this answer choice works against it. How are we to conclude that there were , as opposed to, say, one, or three, or some other arbitrary number? Then, how could we have any insight into why these shows were canceled? This is pure conjecture, the opposite of what we are looking to do. \n\nWe can only rely on what the passage tells us. How would we know what  would look like when the passage does not broach the topic? If our task is to properly draw a conclusion from the statements in the passage, then how can this unstated assumption be our answer? We need to keep looking. \n\nAt last, an answer that fits the bill. The correlation between higher prime-time ratings and increased viewership of the evening news may indeed exist, but perhaps other unacknowledged factors could buttress the correlation (or even be the primary driver). The apparent contradiction presented in the passage regarding Channel NTR can then be resolved. For the sake of simplicity, let us assume two factors:\n\nA—hit show in a prime-time slot\nB—sports recap show to round out a prime-time slot\n\nPerhaps A, followed by B, can lead to a 5% increase in prime-time ratings; in turn, the number of people watching the evening news goes up by 5 * 3.5, or 17.5%. But perhaps Channel NTR wanted to capitalize on the popularity of A and started showing back-to-back episodes in place of B. It is conceivable that viewers might have tuned in for A and then tuned out for the evening news. Perhaps B had bridged well from prime-time programming to evening news, but A and the evening news had little in common. Although this scenario is hypothetical, it is all within the parameters of the information presented in the passage. This is our answer, the only defensible one of the five. \n\nI hope that helps. I would be happy to discuss the question further if anyone harbors doubts.\n\n- Andrew\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "A law that is not consistently enforced does not serve its purpose. Law without enforcement is not law; it is merely statute—a promise of law. To institute real law is not merely to declare that such and such behavior is forbidden, it is also to punish those who violate that edict. Furthermore, those who enforce law must punish without favor for their friends or malice for their enemies. To punish only those one dislike while forgiving others is not to enforce law but to engage in the arbitrary and unjust exercise of power.\n\nThe main point of the passage is that instituting real law consists in\n\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Hi, people, this is a fairly simply one; it took me 38 seconds which would probably mean a solid 1:00 on an actual GMAT.\n\nIt may just be me, but I feel some passages are simply easier to read, comprehend, and get the gist of compared to others. I daresay that this passage has been written to be reader-friendly and is designed as a simple question of theme beyond anything else. Clearly, this is not a question of logic or assumption.\n\nTo give you all an idea how I read this - and what I focused upon - look at the portions below.\n \nA law that is not does not serve its purpose. Law without enforcement is not law; . To institute real law is not merely to declare that such and such behavior is forbidden, it is that edict. Furthermore, those who enforce law  for their friends or malice for their enemies. To punish only those one dislike while forgiving others\n\nIt becomes fairly clear that the author has a strong definition for what he or she considers (real) law. Picking those definition markers should become clear reading the question  - I understand people have their own way with approaching CR, but reading the specific question being posed can help you focus on what to look for in the passage. A few seconds can't hurt to alter your process a bit sometimes. It almost certainly would help in a question such as this.\n\nComing back to the answer choices.\n\nThe main point of the passage is that instituting real law consists in\n\n\n(A) the exercise of power\n\nNope. This seems to be a trap for those who might confuse the of power with . The two have slightly different meanings. But rather than getting bogged down with the fine details, simply ask yourself: is this the main point of the passage? There seems to be so much more. Rather than debate with yourself, keep this one if you must and move on for a better answer you are all but sure will soon present itself.\n\n(B) authorizing the enforcement of punishments\n\nThere is nothing about authorizing the enforcement of punishments. At best you could say this only refers to one part of the author's definition of real law. We need something more general, something that encapsulates all the author is saying. Give this one a yellow flag, if you are feeling unsure.\n\n(C) the unbiased punishment of prohibited behavior\n\nBingo. This actually hits two things simultaneously. The unbiased punishment   --  of (all) prohibited behavior. It pretty much encapsulates everything the author is trying to convey. Don't try to fight the answer. Compare it to the alternatives and judge which one is better.\n\n(D) understanding the purpose of law\n\nCompletely nonsensical! The main point of the passage is that instituting real law consists in understanding the purpose of law? This is a freebie elimination.\n\n(E) clearly defining unacceptable behavior\n\nUnless, I missed something, the author does not mention this in his or her definition. So, it's out of bounds from all consideration just there. I imagine this answer choice is to trip up those who add some of their own story into the passage. Also, remember, go back to the specific question. Is this the main point of the passage? The passage seems more intent on the punishment meted out by law rather than the formation of law itself. (Looking now I can see why this answer choice was given: . This, however, flies in the face of what the author intends and is probably intended to trip up those who may mistake a negative for a positive definition attribute. Perhaps I skimmed over that a little because I was looking for positive definition markers rather than negative or out of bounds ones. Interesting. Keep an eye out for this kind of thing, though. Had the question been posed a little differently not knowing this negative definition might have made all the difference in getting it correct or incorrect.)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t -  -  -   - quick tip: there's a free auto-booking feature on the gmatknight site for a 15-min consult :)",

A new therapeutic program can significantly reduce an elderly person's chances of falling.  Though obviously desirable for many reasons, this treatment program will cost $12,500 and thus cannot be justified.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the conclusion of the argument?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Premises:\nCost of emergency treatment from a fall - $11,000\nCost of new therapeutic program that can reduce chances of fall - $12,500 (though desirable from other angles)\n\nConclusion:\nNew program cannot be justified due to higher cost\n\nWe need to weaken this. Note that the argument concedes that the program has other benefits. It says that since its cost is higher, hence it is not justified. We need to weaken it from the cost perspective. That is, we need to say how the new program may actually turn out cheaper than cost of treatment. \n\n(A) Among elderly people who had followed the program for only a few months, the number of serious falls reported was higher than it was for people who had followed the program for its recommended minimum length of one year.\n\nWe need make the new program justifiable in terms of cost too. Not the correct option.\n\n(B) Falls resulting in serious injuries are less common among elderly people living in nursing homes than they are among elderly people who live alone at home.\n\nIrrelevant\n\n(C) A frequent result of injuries sustained in falls is long-term pain, medication for which is not counted among the average per-person costs of emergency treatment for elderly people's injuries from such falls.\n\nHere is the answer. It says that cost of emergency treatment is actually much higher than $11,000 mentioned (because of long term medication required). Hence this justifies the expense of $12,500 for the new treatment. \n\n(D) The new therapeutic program focuses on therapies other than medication, since overmedication can cause disorientation and hence increase the likelihood that an elderly person will have a serious fall.\n\nThis option tells us HOW the new program reduces the chances of fall. It doesn't talk about the cost of the program. Note that the author talks about the program having benefits. He says it is not justified from the cost perspective. That is what we need to focus on. Hence this is not the correct option. \n\n(E) A significant portion of the cost of the new therapeutic program is represented by regular visits by health care professionals, the costs of which tend to increase more rapidly than do those of other elements of the program.\n\nWhat comprises the big part of $12,500 and how this will change over time is irrelevant. Anyway, if the cost of $12,500 is going to rapidly increase over time, that makes the new program even less justifiable. \n\nAnswer (C)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nYouTube Channel: karishma.anaprep",

That is greater than the increase in the number of adults taking anti-psychotic medicines during the same period. \n\nLucy: But the use of anti-psychotic drugs by adults is considered normal at the current rate of 11 adults per 1,000 taking the drugs. In contrast, the number of children on anti-psychotic medication last year was 6.6 per 1,000 children. \n\n\n ",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A) The current level of anti-psychotic drug use among children is extremely high\n\nB) The fact that number of children taking anti-psychotic drugs increased 73% over the last 4 years is not an indication that the current level of use is abnormally high\n\nC) If only 6.6 of every 1000 children are taking an anti psychotic medicine, the increase in the use of such medicines cannot be the percentage that Antoine cites\n\nD) It is unlikely that the increase in the use of anti-psychotic medicines by children will continue at the same rate\n\nE) If the number of children taking anti-psychotoc drugs is given as a certain number, the actual rate of such drug use is even higher\n\n, but differs subtly; kindly do not delete. Also, please note that OA is unavailable.\n\n\nAntoine is alarmed that the number of children on antipsychotic medication has increased by 73 percent. Lucy begins her reply with “but,” indicating that she is about to counter either Antoine’s facts or his alarm; she accepts his facts but addresses his alarm. If the number of children taking antipsychotic medication is still within the normal range, the rate at which the total number has increased is not cause for alarm. Lucy shows that even though the total number of children on such medications has increased, children still take antipsychotic drugs at an even lower rate than do adults, and the current adult rate is considered normal. \n\n(A) Lucy’s argument is that the rate of adults taking antipsychotic drugs is normal, and the rate of children taking such drugs is even lower. Thus, the argument does not lead to the conclusion that the current level of antipsychotic drug use in children is abnormally high. \n\n This statement properly identifies the conclusion to which Lucy’s argument is leading. \n\n(C) Lucy does not dispute Antoine’s statistics, and her argument is designed to make a conclusion about their interpretation, not about their accuracy. Also, it is mathematically possible for the increase in the use of such medicines to be 73 percent, as Antoine cites. An increase from 3.8 to 6.6 out of every 1,000 represents an approximately 73 percent increase. \n\n(D) There is no information about what might happen in the future, so no conclusion can be made about whether the use of antipsychotic medicines by children will increase or decrease, or at what rate that might happen. \n\n(E) No information in Lucy’s argument supports the conclusion that the rate of antipsychotic drug use in children is higher than that reported.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "Last month OCF Inc, announced what it described as a unique new product: an adjustable computer workstation. Three days later Ergotech unveiled an almost identical product. The two companies claim that the similarities are coincidental and occurred because the designers independently reached the same solution to the same problem. The similarities are too fundamental to be mere coincidence, however. The two products not only look alike, but they also work alike. Both are oddly shaped with identically placed control panels with the same types of controls. Both allow the same types of adjustments and the same types of optional enhancements.\n\nThe main point of the argument is \n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The correct answer choice is (C). \n\nLike the majority of Main Point question stimuli, the argument does not contain a traditional conclusion indicator. Thus, you must look at the pieces of the argument in order to determine the point the author is making. In this case, the conclusion is “The similarities are too fundamental to be mere coincidence.” Use the Conclusion Identification Methodology to help establish that point if you are unsure. The argument uses the fact that the two workstations are similar and were released in the same time-span to assume that the similarity is not caused by coincidence. \n\nAnswer choice (A): This is a repeat of a premise of the argument, not the main point. As mentioned in the discussion, in Main Point questions you should expect to see incorrect answers that repeat premises from the argument. \n\nAnswer choice (B): The statement does not pass the Fact Test. The scenario could be reversed: OCF could have copied Ergotech. Regardless, this is not the main point. \n\nAnswer choice (C): This correct answer is a paraphrase of the conclusion. \n\nAnswer choice (D): This would undermine the argument and thus it cannot be the main point. \n\nAnswer choice (E): Although the author would likely agree with this statement, this does not capture the main point, which addresses the two named products.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "Psychologists have found that there are fascinating differences between children and adults when it comes to learning a new musical instrument. In particular, the piano is an instrument that knows no one age for learning and presents multiple opportunities for the successful attainment of musical skills. It does, however, offer a variety of challenges both to children and to adults – due to the differences in mind development – with children developing certain skills more quickly and more effectively than adults. How quickly children learn is often limited by their motor skills, but they are more likely to remember in detail the pieces they learn and to retain that knowledge over long periods of time. At the same time, adults are more likely to retain the muscle memory of the pieces that they learn and reproduce them blindly, just by allowing their fingers to recall the correct notes.\n\nIf the passage above is true, all of the following may be concluded EXCEPT:\n\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The final question in the second Logical Reasoning section of the test discusses discoveries made by psychologists about the differences between the way adults and children learn to play the piano. The author states that the learning differences are due largely to differences in mind development: children’s minds develop in such a way that they learn “certain skills more quickly and more effectively than adults.” At the same time, the motor skills of children develop differently, so they do not learn to play as quickly as adults might; however, their minds allow them to recall the pieces better than adults can. Finally, the author notes that adults retain muscle memory and can reproduce the pieces merely by remembering the fingering of the pieces, implying that children actually retain a better memory of the piece itself and the notes and do not have to rely only on muscle memory. The question then asks which of the answer choices cannot be concluded from the passage. This means, of course, that four of the answer choices are implied in the passage, so the student needs to consider each answer choice carefully.\n\n\n\nC The author states early in the passage, “the piano is an instrument that knows no one age for learning and presents multiple opportunities for the successful attainment of musical skills.” This suggests that the piano is one instrument that both adults and children can learn to play. This does not imply, however, that the piano is the only instrument that adults and children can learn to play. Answer choice (C) cannot be concluded from the passage, so it is the correct answer.\n\n\n\nA The author states the information in answer choice (A) directly in the passage: “It does, however, offer a variety of challenges both to children and to adults – due to the differences in mind development.” So, answer choice (A) can be inferred from the passage and is thus incorrect.\n\nB At the end of the passage, the author notes, “At the same time, adults are more likely to retain the muscle memory of the pieces they learn and reproduce them blindly, just by allowing their fingers to recall the correct notes.” Therefore, answer choice (B) is clearly a conclusion that can be drawn from the passage and is thus incorrect.\n\nD In the second sentence of the passage, the author states, “In particular, the piano is an instrument that knows no one age for learning and presents multiple opportunities for the successful attainment of musical skills.” This means that answer choice (D) is a conclusion that can be drawn from the passage. So, answer choice (D) can be eliminated as incorrect.\n\nE The author notes in the passage, “How quickly children learn is often limited by their motor skills.” This suggests that the fully-developed motor skills of adults allow them to learn the hand and finger movements more quickly than children, so answer choice (E) is a conclusion that can be drawn from the passage. Answer choice (E) is thus incorrect.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "Set on the wild and rugged Bodmin Moor of Cornwall, Jamaica Inn is most remembered for playing the starring role in a story by Cornish-born writer Daphne du Maurier. In du Maurier’s book, a young woman moves in with a family member at Jamaica Inn, only to discover that the inn is playing a sinister role in the crime of wrecking, that is, setting up lights along the coastline to draw ships in and wreck them on the rocky coast. Du Maurier’s book is hardly an historic textbook; anecdote suggests that du Maurier derived much of the source for her tale from the ghost stories she heard while staying briefly at Jamaica Inn. This being said, wrecking was a real activity in Cornwall during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and Jamaica Inn’s remote locale made it an excellent place to hide from the law.\n\nWhich of the following best expresses the main point of the passage above?\n\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Question presents information about the historic location of Jamaica Inn, which was also the setting for a book of the same name by Daphne du Maurier. According to the author, the real Jamaica Inn is set on Bodmin Moor, in Cornwall, and in du Maurier’s book the owners of the inn are participating in the criminal act of wrecking (luring ships to the coastline for the purpose of destroying and plundering them). The author of the passage notes that ghost stories are believed to be the source for du Maurier’s book, but that the story of wrecking does match actual events that occurred along the Cornish coast during the time setting of the book Jamaica Inn. The question asks the student to identify which of the answer choices best summarizes the main point of the passage. The student should first identify the main point of the passage: although not completely historic in its plot, du Maurier’s Jamaica Inn discusses real historic events that occurred in Cornwall. The answer choice that reflects this most clearly will be correct.\n\n\n\nB Answer choice (B) best restates the information above: that du Maurier took some creative license with plot but used historic events for her story about Jamaica Inn. Answer choice (B), therefore, is the correct answer.\n\n\n\nA The author makes no mention of literary historians, mentioning only that Daphne du Maurier’s story of Jamaica Inn is “hardly an historic textbook” but contains accurate historic information about events on the Cornish coast. Answer choice (A), therefore, infers details that are not supported by the passage and do not reflect the main point; so, answer choice (A) is incorrect.\n\nC The passage does indicate that the information in answer choice (C) is correct: lights were lit along the coastline to lure ships in. This information, however, is not the main point of the passage and reflects only a supporting detail. Answer choice (C), then, cannot be correct.\n\nD The author does not discuss Daphne du Maurier’s other books, nor is there any information in the passage to imply anything about the setting for other du Maurier books. Nor, of course, does this detail express the main point of the passage (The fact that this piece of information is true is irrelevant; the question is asking for the main point of the statements in the passage.) Answer choice (D) is incorrect.\n\nE Answer choice (E) directly contradicts a statement made in the passage: “This being said, wrecking was a real activity in Cornwall during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.” Therefore, answer choice (E) can be eliminated immediately for ignoring key information in the passage\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "The English scientist Edward Jenner (1749-1823) is usually credited with the discovery of vaccines in the late eighteenth century, when he began vaccinating against cowpox (hence the term vaccine, which derives from vacca, meaning cow). But at least one hundred years before Jenner’s discovery, the Ottoman Turks were already using methods of inoculation to prevent disease. Lady Montagu, wife of the British ambassador to Turkey during the early eighteenth century, records that she had her son vaccinated in Istanbul using a method that the Turkish had been employing for decades. The Ottoman Turks, however, were not the first to use vaccines. It is believed that the Chinese had discovered the value of inoculation as far back as 200 BC, and one scholar has suggested that vaccination as a common means of disease prevention might been widespread in India as early as the eleventh century.\n\nWhich of the following best summarizes the main point of the passage?\n\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In this question, a passage provides information about the origin of vaccines, describing conflicting details: the English scientist Edward Jenner usually receives credit for being the first to develop vaccinations in the late eighteenth century, but historical evidence suggests that the Ottoman Turks were inoculating people before that. Additional details indicate that the peoples of China and India have been using various forms of vaccination for centuries. The student is asked to select an answer choice that best summarizes the main point of the passage.\n\n\n\nB All the details in the passage lead to one central suggestion: although the Englishman (and hence Westerner) Edward Jenner is usually credited with the discovery of vaccines in the late eighteenth century, historical evidence suggests that peoples in the East were using vaccines long before Jenner began using them. This most clearly summarizes the passage, so answer choice (B) is the best answer.\n\n\n\nA The information regarding Lady Montagu’s experience with vaccines in Turkey is useful in establishing that inoculations were already familiar to some societies before Jenner’s discovery, but it is not the main point of the passage. Therefore, answer choice (A) can be eliminated for having insufficient information.\n\nC Answer choice (C) summarizes important details in the paragraph, but it fails to summarize the larger point – that because there is evidence of vaccination during earlier centuries in China and India, Jenner cannot necessarily be credited with the discovery of vaccines. Answer choice (C) leaves important information out of the summary, so it is incorrect.\n\nD The information about inoculation use in China and India well before Jenner’s work strongly suggests that the Ottoman Turks cannot claim the discovery of vaccines, but the passage makes no claim that the Ottoman Turks discovered vaccines (or that they are said to have discovered vaccines). Rather, the passage claims only that they were using them before Jenner. Answer choice (D) is incorrect.\n\nE The passage makes no claim that Jenner himself took credit for the discovery of vaccines, claiming instead only that Jenner is generally credited with this discovery. What is more, there is no indication in the passage that Lady Montagu’s son was vaccinated for cowpox, the illness that Jenner treated with his vaccines. Therefore, answer choice (E) is clearly incorrect.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "Journalist: Obviously, though some animals are purely carnivorous, none would survive without plants. But the dependence is mutual. Many plant species would never have come to be had there been no animals to pollinate, fertilize, and broadcast their seeds. Also, plants’ photosynthetic activity would deplete the carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere were it not constantly being replenished by the exhalation of animals, engine fumes, and smoke from fires, many set by human beings.\n\nWhich one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion of the journalist’s argument?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "I had to re-read that \"eh\" in the second line. If that's intentional, what a question! Anyway, getting back to it, I took 1:20 to answer this. It's probably a good idea to recognize that this is more of a gist question than one that can be solved simply through sheer logic. There is nothing inherently wrong with some of the answer choices. You have to pick the best one. What is this journalist really getting at with all this talk? What's the point of saying all this? If, later on, some person asks you: \"What was that Journalist's deal? On the podium for like 2 whole minutes?\" You should reply: \"Ah, basically the journalist was saying (Answer)\"\n\nJournalist: Obviously, though some animals are purely carnivorous, none would survive without plants. But eh dependence is mutual. Many plant species would never have come to be had there been no animals to pollinate, fertilize, and broadcast their seeds. Also, plants’ photosynthetic activity would deplete the carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere were it not constantly being replenished by the exhalation of animals, engine fumes, and smoke from fires, many set by human beings.\n\nWhich one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion of the journalist’s argument?\n\n\n(A) The photosynthetic activity of plants is necessary for animal life, but animal life is also necessary for the occurrence of photosynthesis in plants.\nKind of seems a bit too specific. I mean is photosynthesis really something the journalist is concerned with or is it something used to make a larger point? Keep for now.\n\n(B) Some purely carnivorous animals would not survive without plants.\nThis was a good conclusion frankly. Keep for now. It's strong since the very first line brings up carnivorous animals. But the rest of the passage goes off about a broader issue, I daresay.\n\n(C) The chemical composition of Earth and its atmosphere depends, at least to some extent, one the existence and activities of the animals that populate Earth.\nNo, this one is weaker than the others. I didn't even read/consider this fully. The chemical composition of Earth ---nope! This isn't what the journalist is getting at.\n\n(D) Human activity is part of what prevents plants from depleting the oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere on which plants and animals alike depends.\nToo specific. Not mentioned. Can't even be used formally as a conclusion perhaps since there are no supporting premises.\n\n(E) Just as animals are dependent on plants for their survival, plants are dependent on animals for theirs.\nNice and elegant and just feels right. This is something you might tell a friend later on about what the journalist's deal was all about. \"Oh, basically just saying that animals are dependent on plants just as much as plants are on animals\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t -  -  -   - quick tip: there's a free auto-booking feature on the gmatknight site for a 15-min consult :)",

So, we can use the Yes/No test.\n\n\n\nRegardless of whether craters formed by meteor impacts on Venus could have made some of the lines shorter than they originally were, the lines are still longer than 200 miles.\n\nSo, the evidence supports the conclusion regardless of whether this choice is true.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nNotice that regardless of whether this choice is true and that, therefore, there must have been volcanoes on Venus, it's still the case that the lines are too long to have originated from lava flows given the temperature of Venus.\n\nIn other words, neither the statement that yes, the photographs of Venus reveal some mountain peaks that could only have been formed by volcanic eruptions or the statement that no, the photographs of Venus did not reveal some mountain peaks that could only have been formed by volcanic eruptions has any effect on the argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nNotice that, regardless of whether this choice is true and that, therefore, there are active volcanoes on Venus, it's still the case that the lines are too long to have originated from lava flows given the surface temperature of Venus.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nNotice that, regardless of whether this choice is true, the lines do extend father than lava would flow in the temperature on Venus.\n\nIn other words, neither the statement that yes, mountain ranges might have prevented lava flows from extending farther than they would have or the statement that no, mountain ranges would not have prevented lava flows from extending farther than they would have has any effect on the argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nLet's try the Yes/No test with this choice.\n\n\nThat statement weakens the argument by showing that the lines could have originated from lava flows when Venus was hotter. After all, if the surface of Venus was substantially closer to the temperature at which lava melts than it is now, then lava could have flowed much further than it would now.\n\n\nThat statement strengthens the argument by showing that, when the lines formed, Venus was not hotter than it is now.

Did they follow the same exercise program? Say first group exercised for 1 hour 4 days a week while second group exercised for 15 mins everyday. Perhaps the exercise regime of first group was responsible for lowering cholesterol. Answer to this question will be useful to evaluate the conclusion. \n\nc) Can the same drop in cholesterol be achieved through medication?\n\nThis question is different from the question above. Had the question been: Were the 2 group following the same medicine regimen?\nthen it would be relevant. It would tell us a major relevant difference between the two groups. \nBut as given, if we say \"Yes, the same drop can be achieved through medication\"\nor \"No, the same drop cannot be achieved through medication\" \nDoes either impact our conclusion - that the drop was due to 3 servings of whole grains? No. \nEven if medicine can give the same drop, it doesn't mean that 3 servings of whole grains cannot. What else can lead to lower cholesterol is irrelevant to us. Whether whole grains led to lower cholesterol or not is out question.\n\nd) Did the study continue to track the subjects beyond six months?\n\nOur study period was 6 months. Whether the study tracked them beyond that is irrelevant. \n\ne) Are most consumers aware of the different between whole grains and processed grains?\n\n\"Most consumers\" are irrelevant.

        "explanation": "Normally, the pineal gland governs a person's sleep-wake cycle by secreting melatonin in response to the daily cycle of light and darkness as detected by the eye. Nonetheless, many people who are totally blind due to lesions in the visual cortex of the brain easily maintain a 24-hour sleep-wake cycle. So the neural pathway by which the pineal gland receives information from the eye probably does not pass through the visual cortex.\n\nFor purposes of evaluating the argument it would be most useful to establish which of the following?\n\nThe argument: the pineal gland secretes hormones according to changes in light and dark. Blind people still react to normal sleep-wake cycle, therefore the pineal gland must not go through the visual cortex. We need an extra piece of information that will help us determine the soundness of the argument.\n\n\nHere we are only dealing with people whose sight has not been impaired. In order to evaluate the argument, we need to understand how blind people's pineal glands react to changes in light.\n\n\n\nIf the pineal gland is indeed responsible for mediating the sleep wake cycle, then blind people have to be responding to light and dark (that's how the pineal gland works). True, it is not via their visual cortex, but somehow the pineal gland of blind people must be able to detect light and darkness. Therefore (B) helps us determine that blind people do notice changes in light and darkness. If they didn't, then we could not conclusively say that the pineal gland is responsible for their ability to maintain sleepless, and we could not conclude that the pineal gland does not pass through the visual cortex.\n\n\n\nThis is tempting, but even if we find out that there is another substance that neither strengthens nor weakens the contention that the pineal gland bypasses the visual cortex. \n\n\n\nHere the focus is shifted away from blind people and to those who do not have normal sleep wake cycle.\n\n\n\nAgain, a shift away from blind people. That is we are trying to understand how the pineal glands of blind people work.\n\n\nTough question",

        "question": "­A fast-food restaurant recently gave customers the option of entering their orders on a computer instead of speaking to an employee. When customers order by computer, it displays a list of additional items and suggests ordering them. During the first month, computer orders contained, on average, 10 percent more items than did orders placed directly with employees. Clearly, therefore, the computer display influences customers to order more items than they otherwise would.\n\nWhich of the following would it be most useful to establish for the purpose of evaluating the argument?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "­\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for the conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nWe see that the reasoning of the argument is basically that, since there is a positive correlation between \"more items and \"computer orders,\" it must be that the computer display causes customers to order more items than they otherwise would.\n\n\n\nThis is an Evaluate question. So, the correct answer will be such that different answers to the question it presents will weaken or strengthen the argument.\n\n\n\nNeither a yes nor a no answer to the question presented by this choice affects the strength of the argument.\n\nAfter all, comfort with placing an order and size of orders are two different things. So, even if some customers who placed orders with employees did not feel comfortable placing an order by computer, that fact would not be an alternative explanation for the difference in order sizes. After all, being uncomfortable placing an order by computer would not cause a customer to order less in dealing with an employee.\n\nSo, regardless of how we answer the question presented by this choice, the argument is unaffected.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nKnowing this would help with evaluating the argument.\n\nAfter all, if the answer is \"Yes,\" then we have an alternative explanation for the fact that \"computer orders contained, on average, 10 percent more items than did orders placed directly with employees.\" In that case, it could be that, rather than the computer display causes people to order more, people who already plan to order more use the computer.\n\nSo, a yes answer to the question presented by this choice would weaken the argument by indicating that something other than the display causing people to order more could be going on.\n\nOn the other hand, a no answer to this choice would serve to rule out the possibility that the reason why orders made by computer are larger is simply that people who plan to order more use the computer and thus help to confirm the conclusion.\n\nSo, knowing whether people who planned to order a large number of items were more likely than others to order by computer would be helpful in evaluating the argument.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThe answers to the question presented by this choice affect the case for the wrong conclusion.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument we're considering is \"the computer display influences customers to order more items than they otherwise would.\" On the other hand, the answers to the question presented by this choice would help with evaluating a conclusion about the profitability of using the computer.\n\nSince the conclusion whose support we're evaluating is specifically about order size and not about profitability, the answers to the question provided by this choice have no effect on the argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nSince what kitchen employees could tell about an order would not affect how much the customer would order, the answers to the question presented by this choice are irrelevant.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe answer to the question presented by this choice might seem relevant since it would provide additional detail on how how ordering using the computer works, which could conceivably be related to the size of orders.\n\nAt the same time, we have no reason to believe that pressing keys, touching a display, or speaking would cause customers to order more than they otherwise would, and it remains the case that the orders made by computer are larger. So, regardless of what the answer to the question presented by this choice is, the fact that orders made by computers are larger supports the conclusion that \"the computer display influences customers to order more items than they otherwise would.\"\n\nSo, knowing what this choice mentions would not help with evaluating the argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n B",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Phenomenon - Wedge shaped structures on the coast.\n\nHypothesis 1 - Erosion formed these (perhaps the impact of the waves on rocks)\nHypothesis 2 - Thrown up from oceans by meteor impact\n\nThe presence of what will help in deciding which hypothesis is correct (strong support for one and weaken the other)\n\n\nIf we find similar structures away from water bodies, it doesn't support either hypothesis. Both hypotheses are based on impact of water or water bodies. Since such structures would have been found far from water bodies, they would support neither hypothesis. \nSince hypothesis 1 doesn't specifically say 'erosion by water,' we could imagine erosion being wind erosion but then \"wedge-shaped formations of mounded sediment—pointing toward the ocean\" doesn't make sense. It ought to have something to do with ocean. So not convincing at all. \n\n\nChevrons have ocean microfossils (so likely they came out of the ocean) and they contain metals formed by meteor impact then it seems that meteor impact caused them to come out of the ocean. This strongly supports hypothesis 2 and also weaken hypothesis 1. If they were rocks on the coast and were formed by erosion by waves, how would they contain ocean microfossils? Hence, it helps us in deciding which hypothesis is correct.\n\n\nThe moment we read 'oral history,' this option should be frowned upon. Oral history is narrated history by a person as per his/her impressions. This becomes more like 'opinion' than a 'fact.' So will it provide evidence? I am already doubtful. \n\n\nA lack of data is not evidence. Perhaps it is there but has not been found yet. Perhaps there is none but it actually did happen. \n\n\nNo comparison is given between chevrons and sand dunes.

Schweitzer's discovery therefore adds to the mountain of evidence that dinosaurs are closely related to birds. \n\nThe answer to which one of the following questions would be most useful to know in order to evaluate the argument? \n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "C.\n\nThe conclusion is that dinosaurs are closely related to birds. The evidence to support this conclusion is that TRex bones collagen tissue is similar to that found in birds.\n\n\n\n(A) How rare it is to find preserved soft tissue in the bones of a dinosaur?\nThe possibility of finding the tissue is rare or not has no bearing on the conclusion whether the dinosaur is related to birds or not.\n\n(B) Is there any evidence at all against the claim that dinosaurs are closely related to birds?\nOne evidence the author himself cites to claim that dinosaurs are related to birds. Also, if any other evidence exists against this claim, we don't know for sure about the validity of conclusion. This would further require us to make many assumptions.\n\n\nExactly. If its very common that two animals can have collagen, this weakens our claim since even lions for that matter could've similar collagen but clearly they ain't birds. If it's not common, then our conclusion is strengthened.\n\n(D) Is it possible that T. rex is more closely related to modern-day chickens than to certain other types of dinosaurs?\nRelatability between two species of dinosaurs is irrelevant.\n\n(E) Before Schweitzer's discovery, did researchers suppose that the collagen proteins in T. rex and chickens might be similar?\nWhat researchers supposed, believed etc. before making discovery/while making discovery is out of question. the outcome of their research is being spoken about.",

        "question": "That long-term cigarette smoking can lead to health problems including cancer and lung disease is a scientifically well-established fact. Contrary to what many people seem to believe, however, it is not necessary to deny this fact in order to reject the view that tobacco companies should be held either morally or legally responsible for the poor health of smokers.

Rather, the argument concludes that since other products can be hazardous too, denying the scientific fact is not necessary in order to make an argument against the sanction of tobacco companies. \n(B): Incorrect. The argument concerns tobacco companies by making an analogy to candy companies. The argument concludes that if candy companies cannot be held accountable for the damage that candy consumption causes, the same reasoning could be applied to tobacco companies.\n(C): Correct. The argument makes the analogy between smoking and candy consumption to conclude that the dangers posed by smoking are not sufficient in themselves to sanction tobacco companies. \n(D): Incorrect. (D) is not the main conclusion of the argument but a premise that supports it. Further, the argument does not consider whether the excessive consumption of candy will \"just as surely\" lead to deleterious health effects, just that it undeniably does. \n(E): Incorrect. (E) makes a normative conclusion: what should happen if something else happens. Rather, the argument merely concerns how one should respond to the argument that tobacco companies be sanctioned, stating that they need not make an argument about the veracity of the scientific claims.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t specific GMAT scores with our flat-fee tutoring packages, or to publish student score increase rates.

        "question": "Advertisement: Most power hedge trimmers on the market do an adequate job of trimming hedges, but many power hedge trimmers are dangerous to operate and can cause serious injury when used by untrained operators. Bolter Industries’ hedge trimmer has been tested by National Laboratories, the most trusted name in safety testing. So you know, if you buy a Bolter’s, you are buying a power hedge trimmer whose safety is assured.\n\nThe answer to which one of the following questions would be most useful in evaluating the truth of the conclusion drawn in the advertisement?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "As with all questions, you must identify the conclusion of the argument. The conclusion states that if you buy a Bolter’s power hedge trimmer, you know the trimmer is safe. In the question stem, we are asked to evaluate the truth of this conclusion. Each answer choice is then posed in the form of a question. The answer choice that is correct will contain the question that, when answered, will reveal whether the conclusion is strong or weak.\n\nIn order to understand the application of the Variance Test, we will look at each answer choice in succession and thus we will not perform an initial analysis of the argument (on the LSAT we would analyze the stimulus closely). Also note that on the test we would not apply the Variance Test to each answer choice, only to the Contenders. For teaching purposes, we will apply the Variance Test to each answer in an effort to give you the best possible understanding of how the technique works.\n\nAnswer choice (A) asks if National Laboratories has performed tests on other machines from Bolter Industries. To apply the Variance Test, we should supply different and opposing answers to the question posed by the answer choice. First, try the answer “No.” With this answer, would the fact that National Laboratories did not perform safety test on other Bolters machines affect the safety of the Bolter’s hedge trimmer? No—this does not help us evaluate the safety of the hedge trimmer. What if the answer was “Yes” ? Would the fact that National Laboratories performed safety tests on other Bolters machines affect the safety of the Bolter’s hedge trimmer? Not at all. So, regardless of how we respond to the question posed in answer choice (A), our view of the conclusion is the same—we do not know whether the claim that the hedge trimmer is safe is good or bad. According to the Variance Test, if the answer is correct, then supplying opposite answers should yield different views of the conclusion. Since our assessment of the conclusion did not change, the Variance Test tells us that this answer is incorrect. \n\nThe question in answer choice (B) is, “How important to the average buyer of a power hedge is safety of operation?” Again, apply the Variance Test and supply opposite answers to the question in the answer choice. In this case, try “Very Important” and “Not Important.” If safety of operation is very important to a buyer of hedge trimmers, would that affect whether the Bolter’s hedge trimmer itself is safe? No. Let’s look at the opposite side: if safety of operation is not important at all to a buyer of hedge trimmers, would that affect whether the Bolter’s hedge trimmer itself is safe? No. Because our view of the validity of the conclusion does not change when we consider different responses to the question posed in answer choice (B), the Variance Test tells us that answer choice (B) is incorrect. \n\n\n\nIn answer choice (D), “Yes” and “No” responses do not change our view of the argument, and answer choice (D) is incorrect.\n\nIn answer choice (E), “Yes” and “No” responses do not change our view of the argument, and answer choice (E) is incorrect.\n\nThe key thing to note is that the Variance Test is applied according to the nature of each answer choice. Thus, with some answer choices we might supply responses of “Yes” and “No,” and other answer choices might require responses of “0%” and “100%,” or “Very Important” and “Not Important.” But, in each case, the answers we supply are opposites, and the correct answer is always the one that changes your view of the validity of the conclusion when those different responses are supplied. If your view of the argument does not change, then the answer choice is incorrect.\n\nKeep in mind that the Variance Test should only be applied to the contending answer choices. In the discussion above we applied it to every answer choice, but we did this simply to show how to effectively apply the Variance Test. During the actual test you would only want to apply the Variance Test to two or three answer choices at most.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "Hardin argued that grazing land held in common (that is, open to any user) would always be used less carefully than private grazing land. Each rancher would be tempted to overuse common land because the benefits would accrue to the individuals, while the costs of reduced land quality that results from overuse would be spread among all users. But a study comparing 217 million acres of common grazing land with 433 million acres of private grazing land showed that the common land was in better condition.\n\nThe answer to which of the following questions would be most useful in evaluating the significance, in relation to Hardin's claim, of the study described above？\n\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "says that the PREFERENCE of the ranchers is irrelevant? Please help me understand this?\n\nRegards,\nRishav than private grazing land. Note that Hardin does not say anything about the ranchers' . Maybe the ranchers do prefer common land. Hardin would say, \"I don't care how often ranchers choose common land over private land -- my point is that when they DO choose common land (for whatever reason), that common land is used less carefully than private grazing land.\"\n\nNow we have a study comparing (A) 217 million acres of common grazing land to (B) 433 million acres of private grazing land. Again, the ranchers' preferences are not important. All that matters is that we have some lands that are used for common grazing (A) and some lands that are used for private grazing (B).\n\nIf ranchers treat all grazing land the same, regardless of whether it is common or private, then, all else equal, we would expect NO difference in the condition of the two types of lands. If Hardin is right and common grazing land is used less carefully than private grazing land, we would expect (again, all else equal) the private land to be in better condition than the public land. But the study shows that the COMMON land was in better condition... how do we explain that?\n\n\nSure, it is POSSIBLE that the ranchers' preferences impact how they treat the land (MAYBE they treat common land better if they prefer common land?). But we have no idea whether that's the case. Answering (B) may or may not help us evaluate the significance of the study in relation to Hardin's claim.\n\nChoice (C), on the other hand, will DEFINITELY help us evaluate the significance of the study. If, for example, the private land was in terrible shape prior to grazing while the common land was in great shape, then we could argue that the study does not necessarily go against Hardin's claim. On the other hand, if both private and common lands were in great shape prior to grazing, then we could argue that the study DOES go against Hardin's claim.\n\nThe answer to the question posed in choice (C) -- regardless of what the answer is -- will surely be  to the significance of the study in relation to Hardin's claim. The answer to the question in (B), however, MIGHT be relevant... depending on what the answer is and what kinds of assumptions we make.

If instead, as sometimes happens, a question says something like \"based on the above, which of the following must be true?\" then naturally you're looking for an irrefutable inference, rather than something that is simply a reasonable deduction. So if that's how the question is worded, you're looking for something much stronger than when a question merely asks what is \"supported\" by the passage.\n\nSo for example, if a stem told you the wholesale price of peanuts will increase a lot next year, and that peanut butter manufacturers pass on their costs to consumers, then it would be reasonable to conclude that the retail price of peanut butter will increase next year. That's not certain to be true, because other factors might counterbalance the increase in the cost of peanuts, but it's a reasonable prediction to make based on the information provided.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "It is believed that the earliest precursor to the modern-day camera derives from the camera obscura, usually credited to the Arab scientist Abu Ali Al-Hasan Ibn al-Haitham in the eleventh century. Working in an early version of a dark room, Ibn al-Haitham studied the movement of light and discovered that he could reproduce images by reflecting light through pinholes. Prior to Ibn al-Haitham, though, the Chinese philosopher Mozi had already begun developing a variety of a pinhole camera in the fourth century BC. Later in that same century, both Aristotle and Euclid remarked on the placement of light when projected through pinholes. What is more, the Arab mathematician Abu Yusuf Ya‘qub Ibn Ishaq al-Kindi became the first to project images with an early type of camera obscura in the ninth century. As a result, although Ibn al-Haitham is often credited with the creation of the camera obscura, he is also recorded as having said that he did not invent it.\n\nThe passage above implies all of the following EXCEPT:\n\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Questions references a passage about the early development of the camera and particularly the invention known as the camera obscura. According to the passage, the camera obscura is credited to Abu Ali Al-Hasan Ibn al-Haitham, an eleventh-century Arab scientist. The author of the passage goes on to note, however, that Ibn al-Haitham was not necessarily the first to invent a camera along the lines of the camera obscura and that there had been similar work in the fourth century BC from the Chinese scientist Mozi and from Aristotle and Euclid in Greece. In the ninth century, Ibn al-Haitham’s fellow Arab scientist Abu Yusuf Ya‘qub Ibn Ishaq al-Kindi developed an early prototype of the camera obscura. The author concludes by noting that Ibn al-Haitham himself claimed that he was not the inventor of the camera obscura. In this question, the student must identify the answer choice that is not implied in the passage, so the student must pay attention to the selection of words in the answer choices, because individual words can determine whether the answer choice is correct or incorrect.\n\n\n\nA The passage suggests that Ibn al-Haitham utilized and benefited from the research of previous centuries on the camera obscura. But the passage does not imply at any point that he stole the research. In fact, Ibn al-Haitham recognized that he was not the real inventor of the camera obscura, so he clearly was not stealing research and claiming it as his own. Answer choice (A) is thus correct.\n\n\n\nB The author of the passage notes that “the Chinese philosopher Mozi had already begun developing a variety of a pinhole camera in the fourth century BC. Later in the fourth century BC, both Aristotle and Euclid remarked on the placement of light when projected through pinholes.” And the author mentions Abu Yusuf Ya‘qub Ibn Ishaq al-Kindi in the ninth century for more advanced work on light and pinholes. Clearly, the passage implies that before Ibn al-Haitham’s recognized development of a full camera obscura in the eleventh century, there were scientists from earlier centuries who had begun the work on light and pinholes. Answer choice (B) cannot be correct.\n\nC The passage does not state clearly that Mozi’s work is the earliest on record, but given the fact that the passage is offering a history of the research leading up to Ibn al-Haitham’s work, it may be inferred that the author mentions the earliest recorded work on this subject. Answer choice (C) is implied by default, so it is incorrect.\n\nD, E Answer choices (D) and (E) reflect the inferences of the correct answer in question 11, so both are definitely implied in the passage. Answer choices (D) and (E) are incorrect.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "Useful protein drugs, such as insulin, must still be administered by the cumbersome procedure of injection under the skin. If proteins are taken orally, they are digested and cannot reach their target cells. Certain nonprotein drugs, however, contain chemical bonds that are not broken down by the digestive system. They can, thus, be taken orally.\n\n\n\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This question stem is a bit weird. We're trying to determine a claim that would be supported by the information in the passage. That claim is that \"a research procedure that successfully accomplishes _________ would be beneficial to users of protein drugs.\" So we need to identify the  that would make the most sense in that blank.\n\nIt would be like a \"Complete the Passage\" question, if the passage ended with, \"Therefore, a research procedure that succeeds in _________ would be beneficial to users of the protein drugs.\" Again, we need to identify the  of the research procedure. This accomplishment should be something beneficial to users of the protein drugs.\n\nLet's start with the given information:\n\n procedure of injection under the skin. Pay attention to the word \"cumbersome.\" This implies that taking the drugs by injection is less convenient than taking the drugs orally.\n\nIf this were accomplished, insulin (a protein drug) could pass through the digestive system without being broken down. The insulin could thus reach its target cells even if taken orally. Currently, this is not possible, and therefore insulin users must inject the drug under the skin.\n\nThis accomplishment would allow insulin users to take the insulin orally rather than with an injection. Thus, insulin users could avoid the  procedure of injection and instead use a more convenient method (i.e. swallowing a pill). This would certainly be beneficial to users of protein drugs (i.e. insulin users), so hang on to (A).\n\nThe nonprotein drugs currently resist digestion. If those drugs are converted into protein compounds, they might NOT be able to pass through the digestive system without being broken down. That means they would have to be injected instead of taken orally. This \"accomplishment\" might be detrimental to nonprotein drug users. Regardless, it certainly does not help protein drug users, so eliminate (B).\n\nWell, now the protein drugs CAN pass through the digestive system and still reach their target cells, and this is a benefit for protein drug users. But now their digestive systems cannot process proteins! The normal, healthy functioning of the digestive system would have to be compromised in order to achieve that benefit. Choice (A), on the other hand, represents a clear benefit with no apparent negative consequences. (A) is a much better answer, so eliminate (C).\n\nThis might provide some interesting information about enzymes and bacteria, but how will that help protein drug users?  that information could somehow lead to a further development that somehow benefits protein drug users, but, by itself, the accomplishment cited in choice (D) does not help protein drug users.

        "question": "In the United States, about $5,200 per person per year is spent on health care, while in Britain the amount is about half that. A recent study indicated that middle-aged white Americans have a significantly higher rate of diabetes and heart disease than do middle-aged white Britons. Even after eliminating from the study the lifestyle differences of diet, exercise, smoking, and drinking, the data showed that the Americans have poorer health than their British counterparts.\n\nThe statements above, if true, best support which of the following assertions? \n\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "For this type of inference/draw a conclusion question (and when you see the phrase \"best supports which of the following\" it generally means you are dealing with that kind of question)-- you always want to stay *as close to the specific wording of the argument as possible.* One of GMAC's favorite tricks is coming up with conclusions that most reasonable people would draw but are not necessarily true given the exact wording of the argument. It's often the teeny tiny words, which casual/speedy readers gloss over, that are the key to knowing in black/white terms whether an answer choice is wrong.\n\nThese answers are riddled with classic distortions of the seemingly reasonable type.  Choices A and B contain common \"red flag\" words-- whenever you see these words, perk up and pay extra attention.\n\n(A) \"-- if you are inferring that something SHOULD BE done--a recommendation-- make sure that the argument itself has that thrust.  Here the entire argument is a list of facts and there is no recommendation made.\n\n(B)  -- causality is always something to be suspicious of, and even more so when there is only correlational evidence. Remember what your high school science teacher said: \"Correlation does not imply causation.\" Here there is only correlational information.\n\nChoice (C) is something that a reasonable person might think in the non-GMAT world. In the US right now, this is a huge argument being made-- \"Look at the rest of the world! Why are we spending more but seeing an increasingly less healthy population?\" BUT the very specific wording of this conclusion sets the argument scope around the EFFECTIVENESS of spending...there is nothing mentioned in the argument about effectiveness. Also, I've found in the past that it's often useful to be  of answers that are in the popular consciousness in a large way-- people are attracted to the familiar, and the test writers know this.\n\nChoice (D) uses another familiar trick-- takeand  a little.  The comparison in the statement is between middle-aged white Americans and middle-aged white Britons-- the comparison in (D) is between two different types of Americans. \n\nChoice (E), as Dawgie states above, says almost exactly the same thing as the last sentence in the stimulus. It might even seem too suspiciously obvious for some test-takers. But the correct answer for this type of question is the one that requires the  and (E) does this.\n\n\nThe more you do these, the more quickly you'll be able to spot these tiny words and the traps laid out for you. I'm guessing that many of the posters above, after reading the argument, were able to POE through the answer choices in less than 30 seconds. If it takes you longer right now-- don't lose heart-- keep practicing identifying those little words and your speed will pick up as your pattern recognition skills refine.",

        "question": "American author Gertrude Stein is credited with labeling the post-World War I generation a “lost generation.” Over time, the phrase came to refer in part to the generation of writers who came to literary maturity after the war. Literary scholars have noticed a trend among these writers. The end of World War I facilitated a turn in the literary consciousness and a definite movement toward modernism in literature, often notable for throwing off the restraints of tradition and conveying an overall sense of emptiness and indifference. Modern literature had been developing prior to the war but was not yet firmly established. Another scholar, however, has also noted an unexpected trend: post-World War I authors have produced more fantasy literature than any other generation in history.\n\nWhich of the following may be inferred from the statements made in the passage above?\n\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "In this question, the student is given a passage that discusses the various literary developments among the post-World War I generation. The passage begins with Gertrude Stein’s comment that this was a “lost generation,” and the author of the passage goes on to explain that many of the post-war writers began turning toward modernism in literature by “throwing off the restraints of tradition and conveying an overall sense of emptiness and indifference.” The author does note that modern literature was in development prior to the start of World War I but that it became far more prevalent after the war. Additionally, the author concludes by noting that one scholar has argued for an increase in fantasy literature after World War I, more in fact “than any other generation in history.” The question asks the student to determine which of the answer choices might best be inferred from statements made in the passage. As always with inference questions, the student must focus on locating an answer choice that can point directly back to a statement or more than one statement made in the passage. Any answer choice that pushes the inference beyond the information provided will not be correct, because it assumes more than the passage offers.\n\n\n\nE The discussion of the rise of modern literature and the mention of the rise of fantasy literature after World War I—in conjunction with the explanation that both forms were in existence but not necessarily prevalent prior to the war—suggests that the war itself contributed to the genres in which the “lost generation” chose to write. Answer choice (E) best explains this and is, therefore, correct.\n\n\n\nA The author of the passage does mention that post-World War I modern writers are often known for “throwing off the restraints of tradition and conveying an overall sense of emptiness and indifference.” This does not mean, however, that their writing is among the bleakest and most apathetic in all of literary history, nor can this be inferred from the information provided in the passage. Answer choice (A) assumes too much, so it cannot be correct.\n\nB The passage indicates that many post-World War I authors rejected literary conventions of the past. The passage does not indicate, however, that all authors rejected the literary conventions of the past. The word “all” is far too universal to be inferred from the information in the passage, so answer choice (B) must be incorrect.\n\nC The author of the passage does imply that a number of post-World War I authors were veterans who had experienced the horrors of the war. But there is nothing in the passage to suggest that veterans focused primarily on literature as an outlet after the war. Answer choice (C) assumes too much, so it must be eliminated.\n\nD The passage certainly implies that World War I left the soldiers with strong impressions, but there is simply not enough information in the passage to indicate the number of soldiers to have survived the war. The initial part of answer choice (D) cannot be inferred from the passage, so it must be incorrect.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "In a taste test, participants were asked to try two versions of a cola: one regular and one called \"Cola Extra\" that contained an additional secret ingredient. Two different groups of tasters were told in advance which sample was \"Cola Extra\", but only the second group was told that the secret ingredient in \"Cola Extra\" was white vinegar. Members of the first group preferred “Cola Extra” by a margin of almost two to one, while over 80% of the members of the second group preferred the regular cola.\n\nIf the statements above are all true, which of the following can properly be inferred on the basis of them?\n\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Passages accompanied by inference questions often consist of nothing more than a list of facts or a description of a scenario. This makes it difficult or impossible to apply our usual advice, which is to start with the conclusion or the heart of the passage. Regardless, before diving into the answer choices, make sure you clearly understand the given information and pay close attention to the author's word choice:\n\nThe taste test involved two different groups of testers and two different types of cola: regular and extra. The identities of the samples were revealed to both groups in advance, so the tasters all knew which sample was regular cola and which sample was Cola Extra. However, only the second group was told that the secret ingredient in the Cola Extra was white vinegar.\n\nThe results of the taste test were as follows:\n\nMembers of the first group did not know the identity of the secret ingredient, and most of them preferred Cola Extra. On the other hand, members of the second group DID know the identity of the secret ingredient, and most of them preferred the regular cola. This implies that knowing the identity of the secret ingredient impacted the tasters' enjoyment of Cola Extra. Choice (A) is consistent with the evidence in the passage, so let's hang on to it.\n\nAlthough this unlikely scenario, if true, could in fact explain the results of the taste test, there is nothing in the passage suggesting that this is the case. All we know is that one group knew the identity of the secret ingredient and the other did not, and this is not enough to support choice (B). \n\nWe know that most members of the second group preferred the regular cola, but we do not know  they preferred the regular cola. Choice (C) offers a  explanation for the results, but there is no strong evidence suggesting that this is actually the case.\n\nChoice (C) might be tempting, but compare it to choice (A), which only says that knowing the identity of a beverages' ingredients  affect a consumer's enjoyment of that beverage. If choice (C) said that \"most members of the second group  enjoy the taste of white vinegar,\" it would be a safer inference. However, without further evidence, choice (C) cannot be properly inferred.\n\nAgain, we have a  explanation for the results. Even though choice (D) might make sense, the passage does not suggest that this is actually what happened. As with choice (C), this statement cannot be properly inferred without further evidence. Choice (A) is still a better option, so eliminate (D). \n\nThe results of the taste test might suggest that beverage companies should not reveal the identity of their colas' secret ingredient IF that secret ingredient happens to be white vinegar, but we do not know whether, in general, it is a bad idea to reveal the secret ingredients. Perhaps a more pleasant-sounding secret ingredient would actually attract consumers and enhance their enjoyment of the beverage. Choice (E) is too general and can be eliminated.\n\nEven though some of the other choices might make sense, choice (A) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

Does not help to explain the spread.\n\n(B) People frequently pick up gopher tortoises and take them home as pets before letting them go in places where they have seen other tortoises.\n: This is the most relevant answer. If people are moving gopher tortoises around, the tortoises could be brought into contact with infected tortoises in new areas, helping to spread the disease. This explains how the disease could spread even though the tortoises do not naturally travel far.

        "question": "Consultant: Several recent articles have discussed nonverbal communication as an element of persuasion. Apparently, body language and eye contact are even more influential than words in persuading someone to adopt a certain point of view. Thus, my recommendation is that you hire someone to train your sales team in using nonverbal communication skills. This will ensure their being able to persuade more customers to purchase our products.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most clearly points to a flaw in the consultant's recommendation for increasing sales?\n\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "We see that the consultant is recommending a plan. The plan is the following:\n\n\n\nThe consultant concludes that the the plan will result in the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for that conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nSo, we see that the consultant's reasoning is that, since \"body language and eye contact are even more influential than words in persuading someone,\" \"training the sales team in using nonverbal communication skills\" will result in \"their being able to persuade more customers to purchase our products.\"\n\nThe question asks us to find the choice that points to a flaw in the recommendation. Scanning the answer choices, we see that don't describe the argument. Rather, they provide additional information about the situation. So, this question is a hybrid Flaw-Weaken question, and the correct answer will work like a Weaken correct answer.\n\n\n\nThe recommendation is not for the sales team to make excessive use of nonverbal communication strategies, and we have no reason to believe that they will do so.\n\nSo, even though this choice may be true, it doesn't point to a flaw in the recommendation.\n\nEliminate.\n\n \n\nNotice that what this choice says is positive for the recommendation. After all, if cost of hiring someone to teach nonverbal communication will be offset by increased revenue from higher sales, then the recommended plan will pay for itself.\n\nSo, this fact strengthens rather than weakens the case for the recommendation.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nWhat this choice says might indicate that the company's products may be hard for the sales team to sell, but this fact about the products themselves doesn't indicate anything about whether the recommendation for increasing sales makes sense. After all, regardless of whether the products are better than others, it could be the case that training the sales team in using nonverbal communication skills will result in their being able to persuade more customers to purchase the products.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is an assumption upon which the argument depends. After all, if the sale team's nonverbal communication skills ARE optimal at present, then training them in nonverbal communication won't help. So, for the recommendation to work, it has to be the case that the sales team's nonverbal communication skills are NOT optimal at present.\n\nAt the same time, since we are not looking for an assumption, this choice is not the correct answer. After all, a stated assumption would strengthen the case for the recommendation rather than point out a flaw in it.\n\nSo, we have to be careful to remember what we are looking for and see that this choice is not what need.\n\n\n\nNotice that, if what this choice says is true, then the plan may not work. After all, this choice means that most of the sales calls are NOT in person.\n\nIf the sales calls are not in person, then body language and eye contact will not occur during the sales calls because they occur only when people are together in person.\n\nSo, if true, this choice points out a serious flaw in the recommendation.\n\nThe correct answer is (E).",

        "explanation": "Sally makes a claim that picking one flower will not cause any harm. Joe replies that her claim is not true and supports his response by citing the consequence of everyone picking a flower. By doing so, Joe attempts to shift the focus away from Sally's actual claim. \n\n(A) Whether there are circumstances under which destroying the garden is justified is irrelevant to Sally’s claim that picking one flower is not harmful and Joe’s argument refuting that claim. \n\n(B) A circular argument assumes that which it is trying to prove. The following is a circular argument: \"Only an untrustworthy person would run for office. The fact that politicians are untrustworthy is proof of this.\" Joe’s argument is not circular: Joe does not rely on the assumption that Sally’s statement is not true in order to argue that Sally’s statement is not true. \n\n(C) While Joe does point out that the consequence of the collective action is different from that of Sally’s individual action, his argument is questionable because in doing so he attempts to shift the focus away from Sally’s actual claim, not because he contradicts himself. There is no contradiction here. \n\n Joe attempts to refute Sally’s claim by asserting that the collective action of “everyone” would destroy the garden. This argument is questionable because Sally merely made a claim about the consequence of picking just one flower, not about the consequences of everyone doing so. By using the consequences of everyone picking a flower to refute Sally's claim on the consequences on picking just one flower, Joe implies that Sally's picking of the one flower will necessarily lead to everyone picking a flower (hence, leading to the destruction of the garden). Not only is this assumption not necessarily true, but it is also not supported by anything Joe says in his response: he merely states a premise based on a hypothetical (\"If everyone thought that way and picked a flower....\"). This questionable argumentive technique of shifting the focus from the consequence of a single action to the consequence of a much larger collective action without proving a cause-and-effect link between the single and collective actions is known as the \"fallacy of the slippery slope assumption.\" \n\n(E) Joe says nothing that attacks Sally’s character.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This one showcases an ever-important theme in Critical Reasoning.  Whether it's a classic Strengthen or Weaken (in which case specificity in the wording of the conclusion is super important) or a \"resolves the paradox\" question like here (where the precision in wording in the \"surprising fact\" is super important), when the conclusion or surprising fact includes \"extra\" language (modifiers, adjectives), pay extra attention to that!\n\nHere the surprising fact is the first sentence (the second sentence alerts you to that by saying \"this is surprising, because\" in reference to the first). And look at the extra modifier at the end:\n\nThis year the New Hampshire Division of Company X, set a new record for annual sales .\n\nThis should signal that what's really important here isn't \"New Hampshire set a record\" but that it's a very specific record...it's not a global record, company record, etc. - it's a record for that particular branch.

The real cause of the increased fish-catch is a greater efficiency in using technologies that deplete resources.\n\nWhich of the following strategies is used in the presentation of the environmentalist's position?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Hello, . Thank you for drawing attention to this question. I would be happy to offer my thoughts on it in an effort to help you and the rest of the GMAT Club community. First, the passage:\n\n: The commissioner of the Fish and Game Authority would have the public believe that increases in the number of marine fish caught demonstrate that this resource is no longer endangered. This is a specious argument, as unsound as it would be to assert that the ever-increasing rate at which rain forests are being cut down demonstrates a lack of danger to that resource. The real cause of the increased fish-catch is a greater efficiency in using technologies that deplete resources. is leading the public to believe that, in a nutshell, .\n\n2) Even if you are unsure about the word , jumping across that comma to  ought to reveal that the author of the passage, ,  with the view of the commissioner.\n\n3) We then get an illustration (without peering ahead at the answer choices): . \n\n4) Finally, the author proposes : technology. In other words, the author believes that the increased fish-catch is not attributable to a greater number of fish, as the commissioner has put forth.\n\nNow that we understand the passage, we can take a look at the question and answer choices.\n\nThe question is asking us to evaluate  the author--again, the environmentalist--presents his or her own position in the passage. I would not waste a lot of time brainstorming possible ideas, but I would go into the answer choices instead with an eye on  anything that was clearly off the mark.\n\nAnalysis: Although the environmentalist clearly does not see eye to eye with the commissioner, nowhere do I see anything about . I would expect to see some information about kickbacks from fishermen or the commissioner wanting to raise funds for some purpose by granting more fishing permits,  that would implicate the commissioner. But all we have to lean on is poor reasoning, or, in the words of the environmentalist, . We never get a glimpse into the  behind the . \n\nAnalysis: This can be a tempting choice, since the position of the commissioner is definitely such . Is the position , though? This makes me think of  in which a... hunter of sorts states, \"I love animals. That's why I like to kill 'em.\" Now  is self-contradictory, and if you appreciate dry British humor, you can have a laugh, too. In this passage, though, the commissioner does not hold an opinion that works against itself logically. For all we know, it  be true that the fish population has increased and that the fish could be . It is clear that the environmentalist would disagree with the , but I cannot find anything to put my finger on that would indicate the author would call the position itself self-contradictory. If you were unsure at this point, just set the answer aside and look for more obvious targets. \n\nAnalysis: Does the environmentalist  the argument of the commissioner? I think so. You might consider a less forceful word or phrase such as  or , but the two positions outlined in the passage are at loggerheads with each other, and to me, the environmentalist seems pretty heated. Is there  present? Of course there is. The argument, A, is  B. Comparing the two arguments in such a manner is an analogy. I cannot find a flaw in this answer choice. \n\nAnalysis: It should be evident that we have no such  to examine, nor does the author reference such data. Rather, a vague  in the first sentence is about as close as we get. \n\nAnalysis: Am I missing something here? What was proposed, and where does the passage focus on ? If you look at the last sentence again, the author even asserts,  of... is under examination or debate, not any outcome. And if you can find a proposal lurking somewhere in the passage, please open my eyes. \n\nThis was a fun question, and any time I can invoke a comedy show or sketch and make it applicable, so much the better. If you have any questions, please let me know. Good luck with your studies.\n\n- Andrew\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

Let's understand it.\n\nConclusion: Time for small car &lt; time for large truck\n\nBasis of conclusion: Larger the vehicle size, the slower it appears.\n\nRight?\n\nNow, if you understand the basis of the conclusion, it means that if a car and a truck both are moving at, say, 100 miles per hour (mph). Then, the following speeds may appear to a motorist:\n\nCar: 100 mph\nTruck: 95 mph\n\nTherefore, when motorist estimates time for both car and truck, he would estimate a larger time for the truck because truck's speed is lower than car's.\n\nNow, what if originally, the car was moving at 20mph and truck at 100mph. What would a motorist see?\n\nHe would see:\n\nCar: 20mph\nTruck: 95mph\n\nNow, in this case, he would not estimate a longer time for the truck. \n\nDo you get this?\n\nFor the motorist to estimate a lower time for the car, the car must be moving at the same or almost same speed as the truck.

        "question": "Politician: A government that taxes incomes at a rate of 100 percent will generate no revenue because all economic activity will cease. So it follows that the lower the rate of income tax, the more revenue the government will generate by that tax.\n\nEconomist: Your conclusion cannot be correct, since it would mean that an income tax of 0 percent would generate the maximum revenue.\n\nWhich one of the following argumentative strategies is used by the economist in responding to the politician?\n\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Let's start by breaking down the arguments of the Politician and the Economist. \n\n\nThe Politician's conclusion is that the lower tax rates are, the higher tax revenue will be. The premise cited is that a tax rate of 100% would result in zero revenue because all economic activity would shut down.\n\n\nThe Economist disagrees with the Politician. In fact, the Economist's conclusion is that the Politician's conclusion is wrong. But that's a bit confusing, so let's try to untangle it a bit. The Politician's conclusion is that the lower tax rates are, the higher tax revenue will be. The Economist's conclusion is that this statement is false.\n\nWhat does the Economist use to support this conclusion? He or she says that the Politician's conclusion would mean that a 0 percent tax would bring in the highest possible revenue for the government. It seems that this follows from the Politician's conclusion: a 0 percent tax is the lowest tax rate possible and the Politician concluded that the lower the tax rate, the higher tax revenue will be.\n\nThat's the only thing that the Economist explicitly says. How does this help the Economist reach his or her conclusion that the Politician's conclusion is wrong? Let's think about the Economist's hypothetical situation for a minute. If a tax rate is 0 percent, how much tax revenue is it going to bring in?  Hopefully that's pretty clear: This directly contradicts the results of the Politician's conclusion, so something has to be wrong with that conclusion. That's why the Economist is concluding that the Politician is wrong.\n\nWith that, let's take a look at the question and start analyzing the answer choices. We're looking for the answer choice that captures how the Economist responds to the Politician.\nThe Economist looked at a very specific situation (a 0 percent tax rate) and points out that the Politician's conclusion doesn't make sense in this situation. That doesn't sound like the Economist stated \"a general principle,\" so we can eliminate answer choice (A).\n\nDoes the Economist cite any real world evidence? No. There's no discussion of an actual situation where taxes went up or down or where revenue went up or down. So we an eliminate answer choice (B).\n\nThere's some technical jargon in this answer choice (\"if applied in the limiting case\") that can make evaluating it more difficult than necessary. I'll ignore the technical jargon at first and then circle back to what it means afterwards.\n\nDoes the economist proceed by \"arguing that the principle derived by the Politician . . . leads to an absurdly false conclusion\"? That's exactly what the Economist does! He or she takes the Politician's conclusion (\"the principle derived by the Politician\") and shows that this would mean that a 0 percent tax rate would lead to the maximum government revenue possible. But that's \"an absurdly false conclusion!\" So answer choice (C) looks good.\n\nA limiting case is the mathematical concept of looking at the most extreme values (the largest and smallest values) possible. That's exactly what the Economist did: he or she looked at the case of a 0 percent tax -- the lowest tax possible.\n\nThe Economist is pointing out a flaw in the Politician's economic reasoning. That probably calls into question the politician's understanding of economics. And that may undermine the politician's credibility. So answer choice (D) looks at least decent at first glance. But we need to slow down and read every word of the answer choice carefully. Did the Economist  question the Politician's understanding of economics? The Economist doesn't  question the Politician's understanding at all--he or she sticks to the argument and to logic the whole time. So answer choice (D) is out.\n\nThis one is a little tricky. We need to pay careful attention to  what the Economist's argument did. It took the Politician's conclusion and showed that it would result in a contradiction. Does that mean the Economist cast doubt on the truth of the Politician's premise? Not necessarily.\n\nAnother way to look at this answer choice is to look back at what the Politician's premise was: a tax rate of 100% will generate zero revenue. Do we know whether the Economist agrees or disagrees with this premise? We don't (although my sense is that the Economist probably agrees). So the Economist didn't argue by calling this premise into question. So we can eliminate answer choice (E).\n\nBy process of elimination that leaves us with answer choice (C).\n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "for GMAT Review, 11th Edition, 2005\n\nNetworks of blood vessels in bats’ wings serve only to disperse heat generated in flight. This heat is generated only because bats flap their wings. Thus paleontologists’ recent discovery that the winged dinosaur Sandactylus had similar networks of blood vessels in the skin of its wings provides evidence for the hypothesis that Sandactylus flew by flapping its wings, not just by gliding.\n\nIn the passage, the author develops the argument by\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "First off, it's definitely not a strengthen question. \"The argument develops the argument by\" means that we are going to explain how the existing argument is already written. We are just describing the structure of what we have read. Nothing in the answer choices is strengthening--it's just descriptive.\n\nSo, how does this argument work? The author presents facts about bats and how the network of blood vessels in their wings relates to their method of flight. Then we're told that this dinosaur, Sandactylus, had a similar network of blood vessels. The author thinks that this information supports the conclusion that Sandactylus flew in a similar way to a bat.\n\nSo we have evidence about a known phenomenon (bats still exist, and we seem to know facts about them). This evidence is used to support an idea about an unknown phenomenon (Sandactylus does not still exist, and we don't yet know for sure how it flies). This matches (C) precisely.\n\nIf the answer were (B), we'd need to see the author coming to a  conclusion than someone else had come to. Reinterpreting evidence would be more like \"Scientists once thought that this meant that Sandactylus flapped its wings, but now we think that X.\"\n\nDoes this help?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n |  |",

        "question": "Conrad: The town of Ecoville is a leader in the green movement and is establishing excellent standards for all citizens, standards that will make the town one of the greenest in the country. By the year 2020, all residents in the town of Ecoville will be required to drive vehicles that adhere to certain environmental standards, such as standards regarding reduced emissions and better gas mileage. These new standards will improve the air quality and environmental health of Ecoville.\n\nEloise: The new environmental standards for vehicles in Ecoville are good, but they should be delayed or revised until funding for the standards can be established. As currently planned, the standards will place undue burden on lower-income families, many of whom do not have the extra income to meet the requirements. Even the greenest town will have lower-income residents, and these residents might not have the means to buy new vehicles or convert current vehicles to adhere to the standards.\n\nEloise counters Conrad’s argument by doing which of the following?\n\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Question records a conversation between Conrad and Eloise, during which the two discuss an upcoming change in environmental standards for vehicles in the town of Ecoville. Conrad states that the town is making “excellent,” beneficial changes, but Eloise points out that immediately implementing the new standards would place a financial burden on those in a lower-income bracket. Since it is impossible to expect any town not to have some lower-income residents, Eloise suggests that Ecoville delay or revise the standards until the requirements can be better funded.. The question asks the student to consider the method Eloise uses to counter Conrad’s argument.\n\n\n\nA Answer choice (A) offers the best summary of Eloise’s argument: she does acknowledge the reasonableness of Conrad’s argument about the importance of new environmental standards, but she also offer evidence that indicates a potential problem in the implementation of these standards. If lower-income families cannot afford to purchase new vehicles or convert them according to the new standards, then the town will be unable to bring the standards into effect. Therefore, answer choice (A) is correct.\n\n\n\nB Eloise does agree with the substance of Conrad’s argument (regarding the value of new environmental standards), but she does not offer any alternative reasons for that argument. She merely points out that the plans need to be delayed or revised, and the details she provides explain her reason for this claim; they do not constitute alternative reasons for Conrad’s argument itself. Therefore, answer choice (B) is incorrect.\n\nC At no point does Eloise point out a flaw in Conrad’s reasoning: instead she points out a weakness in the implementation of the new environmental standards. She does not provide a more logical perspective but offers evidence that undermines the claim that the standards should be implemented immediately. Therefore, answer choice (C) cannot be correct.\n\nD Eloise begins by agreeing with Conrad about the importance of the new environmental standards, so it is obvious from her first sentence that she does not disagree with him entirely. Therefore, answer choice (D) can be eliminated immediately.\n\nE Eloise addresses Conrad’s argument directly by agreeing with him in theory if not in every detail, and she goes on to address very specific problems with the potential implementation of the standards for which he is arguing. So, she clearly does not redirect the argument to a secondary point. Answer choice (E) is incorrect.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

The argument uses the fact that the two workstations are similar and were released in the same time-span to assume that the similarity is not caused by coincidence. \n\nAnswer choice (A): This is a repeat of a premise of the argument, not the main point.

        "question": "30% of the residents of Tafta City own cars. However, 70% of the residents of Hampton, a suburb in Tafta City, are car owners. So. it can be concluded that the total number of cars owned by residents of Hampton exceeds the total number of cars owned by the rest of the residents of Tafta City.\n\nThe answer to which of the following questions would be most important in determining whether the above conclusion is correct?\n\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Neat question that plays with percentages. To truly evaluate the argument, we need to figure out a relationship between the actual number of people in Tafta and Hampton. Percentages can be very misleading. Suppose you have Frim A, whose revenues have grown 100% from last year, and Firm B, whose revenues have grown 5%. Which has the higher revenue? Obviously it depends on the actual value, and not just the percentage. Firm A could have a revenue of 10, which grew to 20, and Firm B could have a revenue of 100 million, which grew to 105 million. \n\nA) While this would be useful to know, from that information alone it is not possible to figure out what percentage of residents live in Hampton. For example, Tafta could have 100 residents, and of those residents, 10 live in Hampton. Or, Tafta could have 100 residents, and 80 live in Hampton. \n\nB) This is the correct option. If it is known what percentage of the population of Tafta lives in Hampton, we can determine if the number of cars owned in Hampton is greater than the number of cars owned in Tafta. Since we only have the percentage, it may be misleading. Consider a situation where, there are 100 residents of Tafta, which means that there are 30 owned cars in Tafta. Depending on where those 30 car owners live, it could mean that Hampton has more or less car owners than Tafta. For example, if only 10% of Tafta lives in Hampton, then that would mean 10 residents in Hampton, and only 7 car owners. Clearly then, the other areas have more car owners. But if 30% of Tafta lived in Hampton, that would mean 30 residents in Hampton, of which 21 would be car owners. Clearly then, Hampton has more car owners than the rest. \n\nC) Again, this may be interesting information but it is not required or sufficient for evaluating the argument. \n\nD) This is similar to A. Even if we know the total number of people living in Hampton, there is no way to determine the number of people living in Tafta, which makes D not sufficient for evaluating the argument. \n\nE) This is out of scope. The focus of the argument is not about cars purchased in or outside of Tafta cities, but the number of car owners in Hampton and the number of car owners in other areas of Tafta.",

        "question": "Motorists in a certain country frequently complain that traffic congestion is much worse now than it was 20 years ago. No real measure of how much traffic congestion there was 20 years ago exists, but the motorists' complaints are almost certainly unwarranted. The country's highway capacity has tripled in the last twenty years, thanks to a vigorous highway construction program, whereas the number of automobiles registered in the country has increased by only 75 percent.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?\n",

        "explanation": "I was finally able to make up the correct answer on this one, though, I took just over 2 minutes.\n\nThis is how I understand it - \n\nThe motorists are currently complaining that there is good amount of congestion, but the highway construction program point puts emphasis that it will be able to handle 3 times the traffic and at the same time, the increase in the automobiles is 75% from the last 20 years. So, the highway should be very easily able to handle the 75% increase in the automobile numbers.\n\nSo, in order to find a weak link, we have to find a reason pertaining to the congestion point that is raised by the Motorists. In order words, are they referring to the congestion in the city or the highways ? What kind of travel the motorists generally do ?\n\nThe highway construction program would surely help the vehicles using the highways more frequently but would not be of much use to the commuters who only travel locally and the conclusion does not take this point into account. So, A becomes the weak link.\n\nThe other answer choices just do not seem relevant.\n\nHope this helps !!",

The mall security force, which currently consists of 10 officers, was deemed too small after 44 armed robberies were committed in the mall's parking lots during last year's holiday shopping season. Although most of those armed robberies occurred in the mall's northern parking lot, none of the additional officers will be assigned to the northern parking lot.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most helps to explain the apparent discrepancy described above?\n",

        "explanation": "Let's first identify the discrepancy, using the author's own words as much as possible. \"Although most of {the 44 armed robberies committed in the mall's parking lots during last year's holiday shopping season} occurred in the mall's  parking lot,  of the additional officers {i.e. the officers who will be added to the mall security force for the holiday shopping season}, will be assigned to the  parking lot.\" Notice that I avoided paraphrasing and rewording so that I would not unintentionally change the author's meaning. Now let's break down the author's logic:\n\nIf all of the current officers spend much of their time patrolling the northern parking and there were STILL 44 armed robberies, this evidence simply supports the executive committee's decision to add more officers to the force, which is clearly too small to protect customers from armed robberies. However, this statement does not help explain why none of those new officers will be assigned to the northern parking lot, so (A) should be eliminated.\n\nPerhaps mall shoppers will  safer if the number of officers inside the mall increases. If the goal of were to make shoppers simply  safer, then perhaps this statement would explain why the newly hired officers would be stationed inside the mall rather than in the northern parking lot. However, the goal is \"to  from violent crimes\", not simply to make shoppers  safer. Thus, choice (B) does not adequately explain the discrepancy and should be eliminated.\n\nThe current security force has to patrol all areas of the mall and all parking lots, not just the northern lot. If more officers are added to the force, the security force's CURRENT team of experienced officers can focus on the northern lot, where most of the armed robberies occurred, and the new officers can focus on the other areas that don't have as many problems. This statement helps explain why none of the new officers will be assigned to the northern parking lot, so (C) looks good.\n\nWe are trying to explain why none of the additional officers will be assigned to the northern parking lot \".\" Statement (D) might explain why the new officers will not be assigned to the northern lot during the rest of the year, but it does not explain the discrepancy in the passage.

        "question": "Maize contains the vitamin niacin, but not in a form the body can absorb.  Pellagra is a disease that results from niacin deficiency.  When maize was introduced into southern Europe from the Americas in the eighteenth century, it quickly became a dietary staple, and many Europeans who came to subsist primarily on maize developed pellagra.  \nPellagra was virtually unknown at that time in the Americas, however, even among people who subsisted primarily on maize.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most helps to explain the contrasting incidence of pellagra described above?\n",

        "explanation": "It is much easier to analyze the paradox once you consider each sentence of the argument one-by-one.\n\nIf you map this out... Maize --&gt; Niacin (that cannot be absorbed by humans)\n\nPellagra --&gt; Not enough Niacin in the body\nIf you think about this sentence in the context of the preceding sentence, you can think probably come to the conclusion that people who eat Maize may not prevent the onset of Pellagra because Niacin cannot be absorbed by the human body.\n\n\nThis sentence tells us that many Southern Europeans started to eat maize widely from the 18th century, and started to develop Pellagra!  This means that even though Southern Europeans were ingesting more Niacin, it did nothing to prevent Pellagra.\n\nThis sentence contains our paradox.  Americans have been eating maize all the time but did not know about Pellagra (i.e., they did not develop the disease).  This leads us to wonder what possibly the Americans did with their maize so that they were able to absorb more Niacin.  Once we figure this out, we can see how they were able to prevent contracting Pellagra.\n\n\nNow, lets look at the answer choices:\n\nA. Once introduced into southern Europe, maize became popular with landowners because of its high yields relative to other cereal crops.\n\n\nB. Maize grown in the Americas contained more niacin than maize grown in Europe did.  \n\n\nC. Traditional ways of preparing maize in the Americas convert maize’s niacin into a nutritionally useful form.\n\nD. In southern Europe many of the people who consumed maize also ate niacin-rich foods.\n\n\nE.

Yet the annual number of deaths and injuries resulting from automobile accidents has not increased significantly.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most helps to explain why deaths and injuries resulting from automobile accidents have not increased significantly?\n",

        "explanation": "Over the past 30 years, more and more Sabresians have become car owners. As a result, there are now far more cars on Sabresia's roads than there were 30 years ago. This is a pretty straightforward story, but then we see two observations that contradict each other:\n\n has increased significantly. has not increased significantly.\nWe're asked to explain this paradox. How can there be significantly more accidents without significantly more deaths and injuries?\n\nIt's a fact that the number of accidents has gone up significantly. So what we're trying to explain, specifically, is  to the same degree. Let's go through the choices and eliminate anything that doesn't provide this specific explanation.\n\nWhat does this have to do with the growing number of deaths and injuries? This is an answer choice that  but doesn't stand up to logical examination. If we try to follow the logic, here's where we end up:\n\n Sabresia's best efforts to accommodate increased traffic. resulting from auto accidentsThis choice addresses the paradox by giving us new information about the number of people who might be in any given auto accident. We now know that  the paradox. And choice (B) is doing the best job of this so far, because it gives us a concrete reason why the number of deaths and injuries resulting from auto accidents has not increased significantly. That reason is that , on average.\n\nThis is enough to keep (B) around, and move on with elimination.\n \nThis choice makes the paradox even more confusing. If the most dramatic increases in traffic volume took place where Sabresians are driving  than they do on less congested roads, then we'd expect to see even more injuries and deaths resulting from accidents.\n\nYet, we know that the number of injuries and deaths resulting from accidents hasn't gone up significantly. (C) isn't giving us the explanation we need (quite the opposite). So we'll eliminate it.\n \nWhat does the average age of cars have to do with why and how car accidents result in injury and death?\n\nNothing. Choice (D) has nothing to do with the paradox we're trying to explain. Eliminate it.\n\nAs with choice (D), this answer choice gives us no useful information to explain the specific paradox we're trying to resolve. Comparing rates of auto ownership in Sabresia vs. other countries has nothing to do with the rate of deaths and injuries resulting from auto accidents inside Sabresia. Eliminate (E).\n\nChoice (B) is not a magic bullet, but it does much, much more to explain the paradox than any other answer choices available. So let's not lose any more sleep on this question, stick with (B), and move on.\n\nI hope this helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "Adult female rats who have never before encountered rat pups will start to show maternal behaviors after being confined with a pup for about seven days.  This period can be considerably shortened by disabling the female's sense of smell or by removing the scent-producing glands of the pup.\n\nWhich of the following hypotheses best explains the contrast described above?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "We need something that explains why the amount of time it takes for adult female rats to start showing maternal behaviors \"can be considerably shortened by disabling the female's sense of smell or by removing the scent-producing glands of the pup.\" So we need to compare adult females who CAN pick up the scent of the pups to adult females who CANNOT pick up the scent of the pups.\n\nWe are not trying to explain a difference between female rats who  given birth and female rats who  given birth. Instead, we are trying to compare adult females who CAN pick up on the scent of the pups to adult females who CANNOT pickup on the scent of the pups. Choice (D) does not explain why the group who cannot pick up the scent shows maternal behaviors in a shorter amount of time. Thus, (D) should be eliminated.\n\nAh ha... normally, an adult female rat will start showing maternal interest in a pup that she did not bear after about a week. If this maternal interest is normally  by the odor of the pup, we can infer that the time would be shortened if the female could NOT smell the odor of the pup.\n\nFor example, if the female's sense of smell has been disabled or if the scent-producing glands of the pup have been removed, the adult female will not be able to smell the pup. This would remove a factor that, according to choice (E), normally  maternal interest. As a result, those maternal interests would be developed in LESS time than usual.\n\nChoice (E) explains the difference described in the passage and is the best answer.\n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

It's not that it's the least costly or best overall choice.\n\nSo, the fact that Tagriole costs less doesn't explain why the researchers concluded what they did.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nIf anything, this choice makes the researchers' concluding that Tagriole is safer more surprising, rather than explains it.\n\nAfter all, if Tagriole is more toxic to users than other herbicides, then given what this choice says, Tagriole may also be more dangerous than other herbicides to those who live near the fields where it has been applied.\n\nEliminate.\n\n A­",

However, after Greatwater County painted edge markings on all its narrow, winding roads the annual accident rate along these roads actually increased slightly. \n\nWhich of the following if true, most helps to explain the increase in accident rate? \n\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Stimulus:\n\nClear markings on narrow road are expected to make driving safer particularly when visibility is poor. \nWhen Greatwater County painted edges of narrow roads, the accident rate on those roads increased slightly.\n\nThis is what we call 'Explain the Paradox' question. You were expecting the accident rate to go down but it actually went up! We have to look for the option that will help explain this paradox.\n1. That might explain why its accident rate is higher than that of other counties. It doesn't explain why its accident rate is higher than its own previous accident rate. It had the same narrow winding roads before, it has the same roads now.\n2. In bad weather, it can be nearly as hard to see the road as at night. But the case was the same before the roads were painted. After the roads were painted, it should have been easier for the drivers to drive at night and also in bad weather. The accident rate should have dropped then. It doesn't explain why it increased after the roads were painted. (If the option had an additional statement saying 'There have been unusually high number of bad weather days recently (after the paint job)' or something like it, we might have given it more thought. \n3. The comparison is not between accident rate of narrow roads and other roads but between the accident rate of narrow roads before the paint job and narrow roads after the paint job.\n4. Again, doesn't explain the difference in accident rate before the paint job and after the paint job.\n5. After the markings, drivers felt safer and drove on those roads at night too. If before the markings, let's say the accident rate was 2% and 100 people used to drive at night on those roads in a month, after the markings, the accident rate might have fallen to 1%, but 500 people started driving at night on those roads in a month. So there would be 5 accidents as compared to 2 of before. Therefore, we might have  seen an increase in the accident rate.

During the same period, crop loss from insects has approximately doubled, from about seven to thirteen percent.\n\nWhich one of the following, if true, contributes most to explaining the paradoxical findings above?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The right answer here should be . This question is asking us to resolve the paradox, so we must first identify exactly what that paradox is. In this case, it is that pesticide use has increased, but pests have still killed more crops. So we need an explanation that suggests how insects could still attack more crops.

        "question": "Microscopic plants called algae grow inside the top layer of sea ice in the Antarctic if enough sunlight reaches that layer of ice and enough seawater, which contains nutrients, reaches that layer after splashing onto the surface. Even though moderate snow cover reduces the sunlight that filters into the top layer, sea ice with moderate snow cover typically contains even more algae in the top layer than does sea ice with less snow cover. \n\nWhich of the following , if true most helps to explain the apparent discrepancy?\n\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Th answer is (A) only. (E) is irrelevant. \n\nAlgae grow inside the top layer of sea ice if enough sunlight reaches and enough seawater reaches that layer after splashing onto the surface (presumably, the seat water seeps into the ice after splashing on the surface). \n\nModerate snow cover (on top of ice) reduces the sunlight that filters into the top ice layer\nSea ice with moderate snow cover typically contains even more algae in the top layer than does sea ice with less snow cover. \n\nThis is a paradox - Ice layer needs sunlight and sea water to grow algae. Moderate snow on top of ice layer reduces sunlight reaching it. But ice with moderate snow on top of it actually grows more algae (than ice with less snow cover). Why?\n\n\n(A) As the weight of accumulated snow forces ice lower in the water, more seawater splashes onto the surface and seeps through the snow. \n\nIce with moderate snow on top of it gets more sea water and hence more nutrients. So it grows more algae. Makes sense. Apparently, the impact of more nutrients outweighs the impact of less sunlight. \n\n(B) Seawater in the Antarctic often contains higher concentrations of nutrients than does seawater in more temperate regions.\n\nIrrelevant. Comparison is not with any other region. It is between  ice with moderate snow cover and ice with less snow cover. \n\n(C) As the air temperature around sea ice decreases during the winter, the likelihood decreases that snow will fall and thus add to any existing snow cover. \n\nIrrelevant. \n\n(D) The nutrients on which algae rely are common in seawater throughout the Antarctic.\n\nNot comparing different areas of Antarctic. \n\n(E) More sunlight filters through a layer of ice than through an equally thick layer of snow.\n\nThe comparison is between a moderate layer of snow and a thinner layer of snow. It is not between the layer of ice and layer of snow. \nIn both cases, algae grow only in top layer of ice. If the ice layer has a thicker coat of snow on top of it, it gets less sunlight. If it has a thinner layer of snow on it, it gets more sunlight. Thinner layer of snow gets more sunlight than thicker layer of snow. We have to compare these two cases only. Ice vs snow is not relevant to our discussion at all. \n\nAnswer (A)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nYouTube Channel: karishma.anaprep",

That the reasoning is “questionable” is irrelevant to your task of just finding the answer that follows the same logic.\n\n\nIn this case, a building inspector has been accused of a crime, the evidence has been lost or wiped out by an action, and thus, the argument recommends that the accusation be retracted.\n\n\nAgain, that the reasoning is “questionable” is irrelevant to your task of just finding the answer that follows the same logic, questionable or not.\n\n\nAnswer A switches the statements around, giving the recommendation in the second statement, but the logic is essentially the same. The computer scientist has been accused of a crime and the accusation should be dismissed because all evidence of his crime (hard drives, records) has been eliminated. Answer B recommends that the teacher be further investigated and the evidence is still available, so this situation is very different from your inspector’s. Answer C is close but still not the best answer because the lack of evidence described is insufficient. People still may have heard the speech and be familiar with its content. Answer D argues to sustain the accusation that is supportable by some evidence, which is a completely different situation. Answer E argues that the accusation be retracted based on the lack of identity of the accuser rather than any insufficiency of evidence against the financial manager.

        "question": "Male bowerbirds construct elaborately decorated nests, or bowers. Basing their judgment on the fact that different local populations of bowerbirds of the same species build bowers that exhibit different building and decorative styles, researchers have concluded that the bowerbirds' building styles are a culturally acquired, rather than a genetically transmitted, trait.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, would most strengthen the conclusion drawn by the researchers?\n\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "couldn't resist googling bowerbirds, and he discovered that male bowerbirds really do construct incredibly elaborate nests. Why? Just to impress the lady bowerbirds, apparently.   of the researchers' argument. How do they arrive at that conclusion?\n\nNotice that this choice only describes ONE local population (the one that has been studied most extensively). Within that group, there are more common characteristics than there are differences among bower-building styles. Those similar characteristics could have been culturally acquired within the group OR genetically transmitted. We can't tell either way, so choice (A) doesn't strengthen the conclusion. Eliminate this one.\n\nYoung males have NO bower-building skills and must spend years watching their elders before becoming accomplished (highly skilled). This suggests that the young males must LEARN how to build bowers from their elders. If the skills were genetic transmitted, then the males would probably not need to watch and learn from their elders. Choice (B) suggests that the bowerbirds' building styles are culturally acquired (learned), which supports the conclusion. Hang on to this one.\n\nPay close attention to the details here. Choice (C) compares one species of bowerbird to most  species of bowerbirds. The passage, on the other hand, is concerned with \"different local populations of bowerbirds .\" Thus, choice (C) has no bearing on the evidence in the passage or the conclusion. Eliminate (C).\n\nWe already know that different local populations of bowerbirds of the same species build bowers that exhibit different building and decorative styles. Now we also know that those local populations probably don't have much contact with one another. This suggests that the groups probably don't learn much from one another (little \"cultural acquisition\" between groups). If the groups had LOTS of contact, that might  the conclusion--e.g. if the building styles are culturally acquired and the groups are in constant contact, then why would they have different styles?\n\nBut choice (D) doesn't help us to understand the observed DIFFERENCES. Are those differences cultural acquired or is there some other explanation (i.e. a genetic explanation)? This information does not help support (or weaken) the conclusion and should be eliminated.\n\nChoice (E) does support the idea that learned (i.e. culturally acquired) traits DO exist among  songbirds. But are bowerbirds songbirds? Even if they are, are they one of the songbirds whose song dialects are learned rather than genetically transmitted?\n\nChoice (E) certainly doesn't  the conclusion. The conclusion is still  given this new information, but, unlike choice (B), the new information does not do much to strengthen the given argument.\n\nChoice (B) is the best choice.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

The distinction needs to be made in the two diff races by the competitive people, not between different types of people. \n\nB.

        "explanation": "The conclusion doesn't depend on what time of the year the floods occur. Hence, we can eliminate this option. \n\n\n\nThis is a good one. If more people are attracted to the coastal regions, it's likely they will be impacted by the severe storms. We already know from the premise that meteorologists predict that the number of such storms will increase significantly during the next decade. Hence, an increasing number of people is likely to be impacted. The greater the number of people impacted, the greater will be the damage caused. Hence, property damage caused by coastal storms is likely to cost property owners and insurance companies significantly more money in the next decade than in the past decade. We can keep this option. \n\n\n\nThis option goes against the conclusion and weakens it. We have to support the conclusion that property damage caused by coastal storms is likely to cost property owners and insurance companies significantly more money in the next decade than in the past decade.\n\n\n\nThis option doesn't support the conclusion or at best weakens it. If the property owners do not choose to settle in the areas where flooding was the worst, they will not likely be impacted greatly by the subsequent storms. Hence, the property damage in the next decade will not be greater than that of the previous decade. We can eliminate this option.  \n\n\n\nWe don't have sufficient information to asses how will this affect the property owners. One way to reason out is if the distance between the shoreline has increased the home are farther away from shore and hence, the damage is likely to be less in the future. Hence, the statement weakens the argument.  However, we can't be 100% sure of this conclusion. We can however be sure that this option lends no support to the author's conclusion.

        "question": "Even though most universities retain the royalties from faculty members inventions, the faculty members retain the royalties from books and articles they write. Therefore, faculty members should retain the royalties from the educational computer software they develop.\n\nThe conclusion above would be more reasonably drawn if which of the following were inserted into the argument as an additional premise?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "First, let’s consider the logic of the passage:\n\n\nBut the passage seems to be missing something. It establishes two categories of royalties: those from inventions (that belong to universities) and those from books and articles (that belong to faculty members). But then it concludes that faculty members should retain royalties from ECS, even though ECS doesn’t fit neatly into either of these categories.\n\nThe question then asks which of the answer choices would, if added to the passage, make the conclusion more reasonably drawn. With that in mind, let’s take a look at the answer choices.\n\nEven if royalties from inventions are higher than royalties from educational software programs (ESP), we still don’t know how royalties from ECS compare to royalties from books and articles. So, we have no reason to conclude that royalties from ECS should be treated as royalties from books and articles. Eliminate (A).\n\nJust because faculty members are more likely to produce ESP does not mean that ESP should be treated as books and articles. You could say that faculty members are more likely to produce books and articles than inventions, so ESP should be treated as books and articles. But we would have to assume this with no basis in the passage. And it’s possible that while the likelihood of producing ESP is higher than that of producing inventions, the likelihood of producing ESP is more similar to the likelihood of producing inventions than it is to the likelihood of producing books and articles. So, we can eliminate (B).\n\n(C) merely provides information on the relative prestige of inventions and books/articles. We don’t know anything about the prestige brought by ECS. Eliminate (C).\n\nESP could very well be more marketable than books and articles, but that definitely does not give us reason to treat ESP as we treat books and articles. Eliminate (D).\n\n(E) indicates that the criteria used to award ESP royalties is more like the criteria used to award book/article royalties than the criteria used to award invention royalties. For that reason, it makes sense to treat ECS royalties as we treat book/article royalties. This is exactly what the author of the passage concludes, so (E) makes the conclusion more reasonably drawn. Therefore, it is the best answer choice.\n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

The percentage cited in choice (C) won't help us if including suppliers doesn't save us both time and money. In other words, whatever the percentage, we still don't have any reason to think time and costs will be reduced by the plan.\n\nChoice (E), on the other hand, provides evidence that including suppliers  save time and money. The designers will be able to leverage all of the work that was done on the previously-prepared parts. This should reduce the amount of work that must be done to create new parts. In other words, the designers won't have to start from scratch.\n\n claims that A is incorrect and it is weakening statement, I strongly disagree with it.\nMy reasons :\n1.

The firm, however, roasts only 8 pounds of coffee at a time. Nevertheless, the company has decided to purchase and install an afterburner.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most strongly supports the firm’s decision? \n\n",

On the other hand, if it meets once every seven years, and the composition is completely different each time it meets, then there's no guarantee that the same or a similar decision would be reached then, and its far enough away that it wouldn't be a cause for concern.  We simply can't be sure about this.   \n\n\nHmm.  This would be a reason NOT to get the afterburner.  This is a weakener, and the question is looking for a strengthener: a typically GMAT CR trap.  \n\n\nMaybe, or maybe the afterburner, although more expensive initially, can be used with any size burner, and so can continue to be used as they upgrade equipment.  We can't be sure.  \n\n\nHmm.  We don't know whether there were complaints or whether the air quality board just went gungho on this issue without external prompting.  \n\n\nAha!  Publicity about a smell: very interesting.  Does the smell of coffee roasting has negative health effects?  I doubt it, but there's news about the board enacting regulations, it's reasonable that it might stir a current of fear, because the general public is always eager to find new things to fear.   Give people fear associated with a smell, then they will have a conniption anytime they smell this smell.

        "question": "Mayor:  Migrating shorebirds stop at our beach just to feed on horseshoe-crab eggs, a phenomenon that attracts tourists.  To bring more tourists, the town council plans to undertake a beach reclamation project to double the area available to crabs for nesting.\n\nBirdwatcher: Without a high density of crabs on a beach, migrating shorebirds will go hungry because shorebirds only eat eggs that a crab happens to uncover when it is digging its own nest.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, would provide the mayor with the strongest counter to the birdwatcher’s objection?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Responding to a pm:\n\nThis is what the argument says: \nMayor' plan - Birds come to eat crab eggs at our beach. This brings tourists. So give crabs more area to lay eggs. (With the implication that more crabs may lay more eggs and bring more tourists)\nBirdwatcher'a problem with the plan - Crab density should be high i.e. crabs per square foot of area should be more i.e. area should be less. When area is less, more crabs will accidentally uncover other crabs' eggs while digging their own nests. If more area is given to them, they will spread around and hence not uncover each other's nests by mistake. The birds will then not get to eat any eggs and they might stop coming. \n\nNow we want to find the option that counters birdwatcher's problem. i.e. what can the mayor say which will resolve the problem posed by the birdwatcher? How can the mayor ensure more area for crabs and high crab density as well? \nB gives you the answer. Crabs are very prolific i.e. if you give them the right conditions, say more space, they will breed more and quickly fill up the space. So even if you increase the area available to them, they will increase their population such that the density of crabs will still remain high. Hence, it is the correct answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nYouTube Channel: karishma.anaprep",

Some will pay more than this out of appreciation of the trust that is placed in them. And our total number of customers is likely to increase. We could therefore improve our net cash flow by implementing an honor system in which customers pay what they wish for coffee by depositing money in a can.\n\nManager: We're likely to lose money on this plan.

However, the manager believes that \"many customers would cheat the system, paying a very small sum or nothing at all.\" In other words, the manager says, \"Who cares if we increase the total number of customers? If many of them pay a small sum or nothing at all, we will probably lose money.\"\n\nChoice (D) addresses the manager's concern by saying, \"Yes, we might lose some money on , but by increasing the total number of customers, we will increase the amount of food/pastries that we sell.

Even if they have a cheaper way to make coffee, if many people are paying little or nothing for the coffee, the shop would still likely lose money on coffee. \n\nChoice (D) is the best answer because it directly addresses the manager's concern.\n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "Boreal owls range over a much larger area than do other owls of similar size. The reason for this behavior is that the small mammals on which owls feed are especially scarce in the forests where boreal owls live, and the relative scarcity of prey requires the owls to range more extensively to find sufficient food.\n\nWhich of the following ,if true, most helps to confirm the explanation above?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "question 59\n\nBut I really don't agree with this one.\n\nFirst answer B is talking about \"food eaten by the small mammals\" not the small mamals themselves on which the owls prey. The explanation of the  says that the presence of the small mammals and the food they eat is correlated  and that abundance of this food means abundance of small mammals. But I don't think this inference is obvious as a perfectly valid explanation would be that the abundance of small mammals foods is due to the scarcity of their prey. And understood this way B weakens the explanation instead of strengthening it.\n\nSecond I think answer D is a way better choice. Indeed if D is correct then this means that when the boreal owl does not have to look for food and has a single location where to hunt, it does not range over a very large area as it usually does. Then, we can correctly infer that the reason the boreal owl range over a very large area is indeed because it needs to look for food, therefore D confirms the explanation. says that OA is (B) we can not challenge it. The best thing is to try to understand why is it correct and why others aren't. We are playing a game that GMAT test makers make and we have to learn their rules to master the test. So, any efforts to challenge an OA from  will no be of much use. \n\n correctly mentions the correlation between presence of the small mammals and the food they eat. It is not a far fetched assumption. If the food for small mammals is scattered then the mammals are also scattered in a large forest area. The stimulus mentions that the small mammals on which boreal owls feed are scarce, so, their food is scattered these scarce mammals will also be scattered.  So, boreal owls have to cover a larger area to find \"sufficient\" food, which is mentioned in the last sentence. Also note that this answer choice \"most\" helps to explain the owl's behavior; it is the best choice among all the other choices.\n\nHope that helps,\n\nVercules",

        "explanation": "This is a weaken question.  It's best to fully digest the argument and then make a rough prediction of what a correct answer choice would look like prior to heading to the answer choices in strengthen/weaken critical reasoning questions.  Here the argument states that the imposed fee will be unfair because all travelers will pay it but only the few travelers who utilize private planes will benefit from it.  If we can find a reason why everyone will actually benefit from it, and not just those who utilize private planes, then that would effectively weaken this argument.\n\nA - The existing infrastructure is not what is being discussed.  The issue is that a fee is being imposed to pay for infrastructure expansion, so discussing the existing infrastructure on its own is not relevant.\n\nB - Out of scope.  The argument didn't say anything about this fee reducing overall air travel volume.  It is very possible that everyone who utilizes air travel continues to do so, but only now they have to pay a fine that for many of them is not viewed as far.\n\nC - This gets at our prediction, and is thus correct.  If the expansion reduces flight delays by eliminating congestion, then probably many air travelers are going to benefit from this infrastructure expansion, not only the few people who utilize private planes.\n\nD - Completely out of scope.  Nobody's wealth is relevant here.\n\nE - Saying that the fee will be large is out of scope.  If anything this would seem to strengthen the argument if the fee ends up being substantial for normal travelers, but the magnitude of the fee is in reality out of scope.  The issue is simply about whether other travelers having to pay the fee is fair, and it does not matter if the fee is $1,000,000 or $.01 per person.\n\nI hope this helps!",

This statement is outside the scope of the argument; aviation experts in foreign countries' opinion of AB has no bearing on the AB and its evaluation of Azura Airlines.\n\nB. This statement is outside the scope of the argument; even if Azura's routes are more dangerous than its competitors', the relationship between Azura's routes and other airlines' routes has no bearing on the AB and its evaluation of Azura Airlines.\n\nC. Correct. This statement provides an alternative reason that the number of violations for Azura Airlines would have increased. That is, if the AB conducted more extensive and more rigorous inspections this year, then it is very likely that the number of violations found by the AB would increase. In other words, if more points are tested or existing tests are made stricter, then the increase in rigor of the testing would presumably lead to an increase in violations.\n\nD.

        "question": "Newspaper article from 2007: The use of ethanol as a fuel supplement is expected to increase sharply in the next few years. In the United States, ethanol is produced primarily from maize-the principal ingredient in most cattle feed. And the increased demand for maize will raise its price. So unless another crop becomes the primary source of ethanol, the cost of cattle feed may be expected to increase considerably.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the above argument?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of the argument is the following:\n\n\n\nThe conclusion is supported by the following premises:\n\n\n\nWe see that the reasoning of the argument is that the chain of events involved in use of ethanol as a fuel supplement will result in an increase in demand for and thus an increase in the price of maize that will result in an increase in the cost of cattle feed.\n\nThe correct answer will weaken the argument. In other words, it will show that, even though the premises of the argument are true, the conclusion may not be valid.\n\n\n\nThis choice may follow from what the passage says. However, we aren't looking for a conclusion that follows from what the passage says. We're looking for a fact that weakens the argument.\n\nSo, this choice isn't what we need.\n\nTo avoid incorrectly choosing a choice like this one, we need to keep in mind what we're looking for.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice provides a reason to doubt the conclusion. After all, if it's true that the principal byproduct of ethanol production from maize is an excellent source of cattle feed, then maybe even if a lot of maize is used for production of ethanol, farmers may be able to get cattle feed at a relatively low cost since they can purchase a byproduct of all that increased ethanol production process to use as cattle feed.\n\nSo, this choice does just what we need. It shows that, even though the premises of the argument are true, the conclusion may not be valid.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThis choice is a tempting trap.\n\nIf we aren't clear about the conclusion of the argument, we might choose this choice because it addresses an issue related to the conclusion. It indicates that, even if the conclusion is correct and the cost of cattle feed may be expected to increase, farmers may be OK because they can recover their costs.\n\nAll the same, since we don't need to weaken the conclusion that farmers will have problems because of the cost increase, this choice doesn't do what we need.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice tempts us by bringing up a reduction in demand. So, we could get the impression that what this choice says offsets what the premises of the argument say about an increase in demand and thus indicates that  the conclusion may not be valid.\n\nHowever, the  truth is that a reduction in demand for gasoline will not somehow prevent an increase in demand for maize from causing an increase in the cost of cattle feed.\n\nSo, this choice has no effect on the support for the conclusion.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is similar to choice (C) in that this choice also is a trap because it addresses an issue related to the conclusion of the argument.\n\nIf we aren't clear about the conclusion of the argument, we might choose this choice because it indicates that, even if the cost of cattle feed may be expected to increase, farmers may be OK because they can shift to other areas of agriculture.\n\nAll the same, since we don't need to weaken the conclusion that farmers will have problems, go bankrupt, etc. because of the cost increase, this choice doesn't do what we need.\n\nEliminate.\n\nThe correct answer is (B).",

(Cause)\nThe correct answer should provide a different cause for the same effect.\n\nConsider Answer D: An increase in consumption of non-caffeinated products like fruit juices and herbal tea, points to the fact that the increasing publicity about the harmful effects of Caffeine had an effect on the consumption of non-caffeinated products. That is our cause had an unintended effect. Thus answer D is an effect and not a cause. We are looking for a cause.\n\nMoving down to answer E. It provides a separate plausible cause for our effect. Hence is the correct answer.\n\nFinally, you could argue that increase in non-caffeinated drinks is the cause of decrease in consumption of caffeinated drinks. However, this would be true only in a zero sum world where the sum of caffeinated and non-caffeinated drinks has to remain constant. So increase in one would lead to a decrease in another. But such a world does not exist in reality and specifically is not mentioned in the stimulus. So, one cannot consider that as a cause.\n\nHope the above explanation helps someone.",

If there have been no recent police visits to the Urban Apartment Towers that host people aged 50 and above, we have little reason to believe that it will NOT be the case here.\n\nB: A substantially cheaper apartment complex may be built in a neighbouring town and that might incentivize some of the target residents to move there but we don't know for sure if that's the only factor that potential home owners consider. Maybe the Urban Apartment Tower offers a host of other amenities that might sway the decision of potential home buyers in its favor. We don't know for sure whether the information provided in this option, if true, hurts the management's plan at all.\n\nC: If the residents over the age of 50 are equally or more likely to continue calling police, albeit for different reasons, it would not REDUCE the number of police visits to the apartment complex, a factor which the management considers of prime importance to save their reputation. If the given information is true, there's little to no hope that management's plan (to save reputation by bringing in people aged 50 and above) will work.\n\nD: We are not concerned about the number of police visits to the nearby smaller condominium. If they were less, it's good for the condominium. Will it sway the decision of my potential home buyers to instead seek housing in the condominium? We can't say. Is the # of police visits a criteria one considers while purchasing the house? Could be. Is it an important and influencing one? We don't know.\n\nE: Why would the police be interested in visiting a tea party where people aged 50 and above tell each other their favorite Dad jokes and share baking recipes for their grandkids?

        "question": "In the late 1980’s, the population of sea otters in the North Pacific Ocean began to decline. Of the two plausible explanations for the decline—increased predation by killer whales or disease—disease is the more likely. After all, a concurrent sharp decline in the populations of seals and sea lions was almost certainly caused by a pollution related disease, which could have spread to sea otters, whereas the population of killer whales did not change noticeably\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the reasoning?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Premises:\nPopulation of sea otters is declining. \nTwo possible reasons: killer whales and disease.\nDisease is more likely because disease is killing seals and sea lions and because killer whale population has remained steady.\n\nThe reasoning uses two prong logic to show why disease is more probable than killer whales:\nDisease is already killing other animals so it could have spread to sea otters too.\nThe population of killer whales has remained steady.\n\nWe can weaken the conclusion by weakening either. \n\n(A) Killer whales in the North Pacific usually prey on seals and sea lions but will, when this food source is scarce, seek out other prey.\n\nThis shows that even though the population of killer whales hasn't increased, they could be the reason for decreased sea otter population. Their usual prey - seals and sea lions - have dwindled because of disease. So they could be seeking out sea otters. Hence it weakens the argument by showing that even if the killer whale population has not increased, more of them could be relying on sea otters as food source. \n\n\n(B) There is no indication that the sea otter population at any North Pacific location declined in the 1980s because of substantial numbers of sea otters migrating to other locations.\n\nNote that the scope of our argument is limited - out of two plausible explanations, one is more likely than the other. We don't have to worry about any other explanation. It is either disease or killer whales. We need to compare the likelihood of these two only. Hence any option talking about any other reasoning is out of scope of the argument. \n\n(C) Along the Pacific coast of North America in the 1980s, sea otters were absent from many locations where they had been relatively common in former times.\n\nThis doesn't strengthen/weaken either of the two explanations. It just says that sea otter population has declined in a way that they are absent from some location. What caused it, disease or killer whales, we don't know.\n\n\n(D) Following the decline in the population of the sea otters, there was an increase in the population of sea urchins, which are sea otters' main food source.\n\nAgain, this has nothing to do with WHY sea otter population declined - the concern of our argument. What happened after sea otter population declined is out of scope. \n\n(E) The North Pacific populations of seals and sea lions cover a wider geographic area than does the population of sea otters.\n\nThe geographical area covered by seals and sea lions doesn't affect our argument. We want to compare the two explanations - disease or killer whales. It doesn't affect either.\nNote that a change in geographical area covered by prey of killer whales could have had some impact.\n\nAnswer (A)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nYouTube Channel: karishma.anaprep",

        "explanation": "This is a weaken question.  It's best to fully digest the argument and then make a rough prediction of what a correct answer choice would look like prior to heading to the answer choices in strengthen/weaken critical reasoning questions.  Here the argument states that the imposed fee will be unfair because all travelers will pay it but only the few travelers who utilize private planes will benefit from it.  If we can find a reason why everyone will actually benefit from it, and not just those who utilize private planes, then that would effectively weaken this argument.\n\nA - The existing infrastructure is not what is being discussed.  The issue is that a fee is being imposed to pay for infrastructure expansion, so discussing the existing infrastructure on its own is not relevant.\n\nB - Out of scope.  The argument didn't say anything about this fee reducing overall air travel volume.  It is very possible that everyone who utilizes air travel continues to do so, but only now they have to pay a fine that for many of them is not viewed as far.\n\nC - This gets at our prediction, and is thus correct.  If the expansion reduces flight delays by eliminating congestion, then probably many air travelers are going to benefit from this infrastructure expansion, not only the few people who utilize private planes.\n\nD - Completely out of scope.  Nobody's wealth is relevant here.\n\nE - Saying that the fee will be large is out of scope.  If anything this would seem to strengthen the argument if the fee ends up being substantial for normal travelers, but the magnitude of the fee is in reality out of scope.  The issue is simply about whether other travelers having to pay the fee is fair, and it does not matter if the fee is $1,000,000 or $.01 per person.\n\nI hope this helps!",

The mall security force, which currently consists of 10 officers, was deemed too small after 44 armed robberies were committed in the mall's parking lots during last year's holiday shopping season. Although most of those armed robberies occurred in the mall's northern parking lot, none of the additional officers will be assigned to the northern parking lot.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most helps to explain the apparent discrepancy described above?\n",

Now let's break down the author's logic:\n\nIf all of the current officers spend much of their time patrolling the northern parking and there were STILL 44 armed robberies, this evidence simply supports the executive committee's decision to add more officers to the force, which is clearly too small to protect customers from armed robberies. However, this statement does not help explain why none of those new officers will be assigned to the northern parking lot, so (A) should be eliminated.\n\nPerhaps mall shoppers will  safer if the number of officers inside the mall increases. If the goal of were to make shoppers simply  safer, then perhaps this statement would explain why the newly hired officers would be stationed inside the mall rather than in the northern parking lot. However, the goal is \"to  from violent crimes\", not simply to make shoppers  safer. Thus, choice (B) does not adequately explain the discrepancy and should be eliminated.\n\nThe current security force has to patrol all areas of the mall and all parking lots, not just the northern lot. If more officers are added to the force, the security force's CURRENT team of experienced officers can focus on the northern lot, where most of the armed robberies occurred, and the new officers can focus on the other areas that don't have as many problems. This statement helps explain why none of the new officers will be assigned to the northern parking lot, so (C) looks good.\n\nWe are trying to explain why none of the additional officers will be assigned to the northern parking lot \".\" Statement (D) might explain why the new officers will not be assigned to the northern lot during the rest of the year, but it does not explain the discrepancy in the passage. Eliminate (D).\n\nThe new officers will be added \"to keep shoppers safe from  crimes.\" Reducing the number of non-violent crimes is not the goal, so choice (E) is not relevant. Eliminate (E).\n\n(C) is the best choice.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

It does not answer the questions as to why new reporters should not use the term \"loophole\".\n(C) News stories need to give evidence to back up any suggestions of misconduct. - CORRECT. Rephrases the conclusion just. \n(D) Editorial writers  loaded, partisan words. - WRONG. Like B this too is not having any impact. Looks bland feels bland.\n(E) News reporters  on wrongdoing and scandal that is not a matter of public interest.­ - WRONG. Just like B and D.\n\nLooks abstract as it can but it's simple as it can.\n\nAnswer B.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "explanation": "City council member: Demand for electricity has been increasing by 1.5 percent a year, and there simply is no more space to build additional power plants to meet future demand increases. We must therefore begin to curtail usage, which is why I propose passing ordinances requiring energy-conservation measures in all city departments.\n\nThe city council member's proposal assumes which of the following?\n\n(A) Existing power plants do not have the capacity to handle all of the projected increase in demand for electricity.\n(B) No city departments have implemented energy-conservation measures voluntarily.\n(C) Passing ordinances designed to curtail electricity usage will not have negative economic consequences for the city.\n(D) Residential consumers are not responsible for the recent increases in demand for electricity.\n(E)  City departments that successfully conserve energy will set a good example for residential and industrial consumers of electricity.\n\n\n\n\n\n Whether city departments have instituted electricity curtailing is totally irrelevant to the argument that this ordinance could save even more.  \n\n Whether there are negative economic consequences is irrelevant. Even if this plan resulted in negative consequences, it could still help achieve the ultimate conservation goals. That wouldn't disprove the merits of the plan, so this option is not required for the argument to hold.\n\n Whether consumers are to blame for the increases is irrelevant to the likelihood of success of the plan for governments to trim usage to help cut energy consumption. \n\n The argument also does not rest on the idea that these city departments will serve as a role model. Maybe they will, maybe they won't but that is just ot required by the council member's proposal.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTotal GMAT Content &amp; Tactical Training | 120 Point Guarantee | All 6 Official GMAT Tests\nempowergmat.com",

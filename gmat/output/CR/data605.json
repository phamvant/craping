        "question": "In response to viral infection, the immune systems of mice typically produce antibodies that destroy the virus by binding to proteins on its surface. Mice infected with a herpesvirus generally develop keratitis, a degenerative disease affecting part of the eye. Since proteins on the surface of cells in this part of the eye closely resemble those on the herpesvirus surface, scientists hypothesize that these cases of keratitis are caused by antibodies to herpesvirus.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, gives the greatest additional support to the scientist's hypothesis?\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "Start with the scientists' hypothesis. We are told that mice infected with a herpesvirus generally develop keratitis. The hypothesis is that \"these cases of keratitis (those in mice infected with herpesvirus) are caused by antibodies to herpesvirus\".\n\nNow that we've identified the hypothesis, let's look at how the scientists arrived at this hypothesis:\n\nIn order for this statement to support the hypothesis, we would need additional information. What happens when mice are infected with those other types of virus? Do the organs with similar proteins suffer any damage? If so, then the hypothesis would be supported. But without further evidence, choice (A) doesn't help. Eliminate (A).\n\nThese poor mice won't be able to fight the herpesvirus. If these mice also did NOT develop keratitis once infected with the herpesvirus, then we would have some solid support for the hypothesis. Unfortunately, we are not given such information.\n\nAll we know is that the mice who can't fight the herpesvirus contract the virus at about the same rate as other mice. We aren't interested in herpesvirus contraction rates. We are interested in the cause of the keratitis that generally develops in the infected mice. Eliminate (B).\n\nThis statement probably weakens the hypothesis. The scientists argue that the keratitis is caused by the antibodies. If these mice produce the same levels of antibodies and the antibodies cause the keratitis, then why wouldn't those mice also develop keratitis? This suggests that the antibodies  actually causing the keratitis.\n\nIf infected mice that do not develop keratitis did NOT produce as many antibodies as infected mice that do develop keratitis, then we would have support for the hypothesis. But this is not what statement (C) says, so eliminate (C).\n\nAh ha! This is what we were looking for in choice (B). The mice are unable to form antibodies in response to herpes infections. These poor mice cannot fight the virus, but they also do not develop keratitis. No antibodies, no keratitis. This certainly supports the scientists' hypothesis, so hang on to (D).\n\n \nNotice that the hypothesis specifically refers to \"THESE CASES of keratitis.\" Which cases? Those that develop in mice . So the scientists are not trying to explain causes of ALL cases of keratitis. Instead, they are only trying to explain the cases that develop in mice infected with herpesvirus.\n\nChoice (E) does suggest that there are other ways to develop keratitis (besides the way proposed by the scientists). If anything, this slightly weakens the hypothesis by implying that something else (besides the antibodies to herpesvirus) could be causing these cases of keratitis. At best, choice (E) is irrelevant. At worst, it weakens the hypothesis, so eliminate (E).\n\nChoice (D) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The doctor concludes the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for that conclusion basically that there is a correlation between \"frequently exposed to germs\" and \"less likely  to develop allergies.\"\n\nSo, the doctor has seen a correlation and concluded that there is a cause-effect relationship between exposure to germs and improved functioning of the immune system.\n\n\n\nThe correct answer will be the one that presents a question such that different answers to the question weaken or strengthen the case for the conclusion.\n\n\n\nThe fact that this choice is about \"farm animals\" whereas the argument appears to be about the human immune system is a clue sign this choice probably isn't correct.\n\nWhen we analyze this choice, we see that, indeed, neither a yes answer nor a no answer to the question presented by this choice affects the argument.\n\nAfter all, we're seeking to determine whether exposure to microorganisms improves immune system function. Even if, in some cases, exposure to microorganisms can cause animals to develop allergies, it could still be the case that, in general, exposure to microorganisms improves immune system function.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nDifferent answers to this question do not affect the strength of the argument. After all, information on which species of microorganisms the children are exposed to doesn't by itself indicate whether exposure to those organisms improves the functioning of the immune system.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe answer to this question helps us to evaluate the argument.\n\nAfter all, if the answer to this question is that there are other aspects of the lifestyles of children on farms that could cause them to have better functioning immune systems, then maybe they are less likely to develop allergies because of those other aspects rather than because of exposure to germs.\n\nOn the other hand, if the answer is that there are not other aspects of the lifestyles of children on farms that could cause them to have better functioning immune systems, then we can be more confident that exposure to germs is what's making the difference.\n\nSo, different answers to this question can weaken or strengthen the argument.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThe answer to this question doesn't affect the strength of the argument. After all, we already know that exposure to microorganisms from farm animals is correlated with being less likely to develop allergies. So, information that the same pattern holds for adults would not strengthen the argument.\n\nThe conclusion is about why that pattern holds, not about whether that pattern holds. More information on whether that pattern holds does not tell us why it does.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice mentions alleriges, farms, and allergens found on farms to create confusion and seem correct.\n\nAfter all, we might get the impression that, if the answer to this question is \"No, and most of the allergies suffered by adults who did not grow up on farms are  caused by allergens found on farms, then perhaps what's really going on is that people who grow up on farms and people who don't have different likelihoods of developing allergies because they are exposed to different allergens.\n\nOne reason we don't choose this choice is that we don't have information indicating that different allergens have different likelihoods of causing allergies. So, even if the people in the two groups are exposed to different sets of allergens, the information we have doesn't indicate that that difference would affect the functioning of their immune systems one way or another.\n \nFurthermore, the answer to this choice doesn't give us a solid basis for comparison of people who grow up on farms and people who don't. After all, the answer to this question would not tell us whether people most of the allergies suffered by people who  grow up on farms are caused by allergens found on farms. So, we don't know from the answer to this question whether there is any difference between the allergens that cause the allergies suffered by people in the  two groups.\n\nSo, the answer to this question neither weakens nor  strengthens the argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n C­",

        "explanation": "Dear ,\nI am responding to your pm  \nI agree this is not the best question --- in particular, it seems to requires some understanding of when \"early hominids\" lived or what constitutes \"early hominids.\"  It believe it's no coincidence that GMAC decided to drop this question in the move from OG12 to OG13.  Nevertheless, the question has a clear answer.   \n\nHere are the facts of the argument:\nWe find these 1 million year old charred bone fragments.  We  know  they were charred.  \nThe argument tells us -- simple campfires  done the charring.  OK, that's good --- that means, the charring is at least  with the possibility of early hominids using fire, but it's certainly  done by early hominids. \nBy the end of the argument, we still don't know: how were the bone charred?  Were they \"cooked\" by early hominids? Or were all those animals simply caught in a forest fire around the same time?  We don't know what charred the bones, and we don't know whether humans were involved.  \n\nNow, the question: \"?\"  In other words, what would help us link the involvement of early human to the charring of the bones.  Let's say for simplicity we have two possible hypotheses for how the bones were charred:\n(a) forest fire\n(b) use of fire by early hominids\nWhat further piece of evidence supports choosing (b) over (a)?  \n\nChoices (A), (B), and (C) are ridiculous.  Choice (D) is tempting --- if early hominids controlled fire 500,000 year ago, then at least it weakly suggests that maybe they could have controlled it 1M ya.  .  Evidence that early hominids had adopted any technology at Time #1 is strong evidence that they knew about this technology  Time #1, but it's very hard to make the argument that they definitely know about it  Time #1.  There's half a million years between 1M ya and 500K ya, and if mastery of fire were introduced any time in that half-million year span, that would mean that we couldn't deduce use of fire 1M ya from use of fire 500K ya.  Choice (D) is, at best, weak, ambiguous, wishy-washy support for the argument.  \n\nChoice (E) --- where we found the charred bone, we also found hominid tools --- aha!  That is compelling evidence that the animals weren't just running wild and happened to be killed in a forest fire.  It's compelling evidence that they were intentionally killed and cut up by early hominids, and therefore the charring of the bones happened when the animal remains were in the possession of the early hominids, presumably in some kind of cooking process.  That strongly suggests the early hominids were able to use control and use fire.  This is powerful support for interpretation (b) over interpretation (a).  That's why (E) is a clear choice for the answer.  \n\nDoes all this make sense?\n\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)",

How could the company be better off? It must be the case that It is able to collect from the customer with the total amount greater than 15% of the total amount of the outstanding bills after deducts all collecting-related cost.\n\n\nThis is similar to our thought. Let's keep it for now.\n\n\nHmmm. This one talks about cost which is mentioned in our thought as well. Let's analyze it further. \n\nSo, this says that the cost does not exceed 15% of the bills. Is the argument assuming this? What if the cost exceeds 15% of the total amount of the bills but the average collected amount is 50% of the outstanding bills? Net received amount = 50% - 15% = 35%. This is still greater than 15%. So B is not assumed\n\n\nOk. The agencies are unable to collect only 15% of the total amount of those bills. Does that mean on average, the collection agencies are successful in collecting 20%, 50%, 80%, or even 5%? This statement is unclear.\nAlso, Let's say that the agency is able to collect only less than 15% and the company is able to collect 20%. Does that mean the company will be better off? No, what if the cost of collecting exceeds 20%, then the company will actually lose money. If my company is losing money by doing so, I would rather hiring the collecting agencies. Some money back, Less stress. For that reason, C is out.\n\n\nLet's take an extreme case.\nOut of 100 customers, at least 15 of them will pay no matter what. What's wrong here? let's say the total amount that must be collected from those 100 customers is 1 million dollars. 15% of them owe only $100 each, totaling to $1500; how about 50% of them each owe only $100? The total is just $5000— The averages of each case are 0.0015% and 0.5% respectively. However, If the agency can collect 15% on average then the total amount of 15% of 1mil, which is $150,000. The company is way better off using the collecting agencies' services. \n\n\n\nThe argument only concerns whether the company is better doing the collecting itself or hiring the collecting agency.

        "explanation": "Hi Vibha\n\nLet us try to analyze the stimulus.\n\n \n\n1) Most sci-fi movies released in the past few years have not performed commercially. \n2) Scriptwriters need to develop better impressions about the possible future by X, Y, Z methods...\n\n The above measure would successfully address the issue of sci-fi movies not performing commercially.\n\nIn order to arrive at the conclusion, we not only need to assess the conclusion but we need to assess the conclusion  the premises mentioned in the stimulus ie; the assumption must tell us how the conclusion holds in the presence of the premises, and not only by itself.\n\nSimilarly, the negation of the assumption should negate the conclusion  the premises. Let us consider option (E).\n\n\n\nI would like to point out a couple of errors that you have made in negating option (E). The opposite of \"all have X\" is not \"all do not have X\" but \"some do not have X\". \"All\" translates to \"every single one of\". To negate that, it is enough if \"some\" of the set do not satisfy the criterion - it is not necessary for \"every single one of\" the set to not satisfy the criterion. \n\nSecondly, option (E) only talks about \"popular\" sci-fi movies having acceptable plots - in negating, you have missed out the important \"popular\" qualification for this option. \n\nGiven the above, the negated form of option (E) will be:\n\n\n\nAs you can see clearly, the above statement does not explain how, given poor commercial performance of recent sci-fi movies and scriptwriters making better impressions about the future, the problem of poor commercial performance  rectified. Now consider the same approach with option (C).\n\nC) Making the plot more acceptable to general public shall increase the viewership of the movie.\nNegated (C): Making the plot more acceptable to general public shall  increase the viewership of the movie.\n\nClearly, if the negated version is true, then developing better impressions of the future (and thereby making the plot more acceptable) will not solve the problem of poor commercial performance of recent sci-fi movies. The conclusion stands negated when taking into account the given premises. This makes (C) the correct answer.\n\nHope this helps.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

The thing was probably manufactured in East Golo.\n\nWhich one of the following is the best expression of an unstated premise that underlies the author’s reasoning in the passage? \n\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The author first provides us with a fact: \"That gadget I bought for the kitchen last week has already broken.\"\n\nThen, he/she connects it to a general trend: \"It’s just another example of the shoddy products that we are seeing more and more of these days.\"\n\nFinally, the author throws out a claim: \"The thing was probably manufactured in East Golo.\"\n\nNotice that there's really  Why the heck does the author think that this thing came from East Golo? That's what we're trying to find in the answer choices -- an unstated premise that underlies the author’s reasoning.\n\n(A) specifies that shoddy materials are the main issue. But the author doesn't care about what, exactly, made the product break -- it could be materials, or poor assembly, or anything else. Singling out shoddy materials doesn't help us connect the dots and understand why the author thinks that the gadget comes from East Golo.\n\nEliminate (A).\n\nThis provides exactly the support that we need! The author relies on an unstated idea that the gadget is likely from East Golo because it broke quickly. (B) connects the dots from the fact at the beginning to the claim at the end.\n\nKeep (B).\n\nThe author doesn't make any statements about what  happen -- he/she only makes a claim of what probably DID happen. So, (C) isn't a premise that underlies the author's argument.\n\nGet rid of (C).\n\nThis doesn't quite connect the dots in the argument. The author has a broken gadget, and we're trying to understand why he/she believes it comes from East Golo.\n\n(D) gives us a hypothetical about East Golo -- what if everything from there breaks quickly? Then the kitchen gadgets from there would break quickly. The issue is that we have no evidence that everything that is manufactured in East Golo breaks quickly, so we have no idea if the bit about the kitchen gadgets follows.\n\n(D) is out.\n\n(E) flips the logic of the passage. Saying that gadgets that DO break are probably from East Golo is different than saying that EVERYTHING from East Golo breaks.\n\nImagine this scenario: 100 things are manufactured in East Golo, and 5 of them break within a week. 100 things are manufactured elsewhere, and none of them break within a week.\n\nIn this scenario, you can claim that something that breaks is probably from East Golo, even if not  from East Golo breaks. After all, 95 things from East Golo didn't break!\n\nThat's why (E) is not a premise underlying the author's argument, and (B) is the correct answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "Recent research has indicated that married people are not only happier than unmarried people, but also healthier. This study has been widely reported by the media, with most commentators concluding that being married is good for one’s health and attitude.\n\nThe conclusion of the media commentators depends on which of the following assumptions?\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "My approach to CR question is first to determine the flaw in the argument (if the stimulus is an argument as oppose to statement of fact).  Especially with an assumption question, the argument is most likely to be flaw.  For instance, in this question, the flaw is correlation an causation.  The commentator claims that just because there is a correlation between marriage and happiness + health benefits, you can conclude that marriage is good for your health and mental attitude.  \n\nAs for me, I was down between C and D as well.  \n\nAnswer choice D is correct because  address this flaw in a very sneaky way.  Choice D address this correlation and causation issue by eliminating the possibility that depression and health issue is actually causing people to NOT get married by saying that \n\" Single people with depression or health problems are just as likely to get married as are other single people.\"  \n\nIf we negate answer choice D, then we'll see that the conclusion above does not hold.  If we negate choice D, we'll get \"Single people with depression or health problems are NOT AS LIKELY to get married as are other single people.\"  This show that there are actually a reverse correlation between marriage and depression.  \n\n\nAnswer choice C: is incorrect because as stated earlier, if we negate C.  The conclusion still holds.  This example might help for those of us who still think C is correct.  What if I say that running 10 mile is a good for your cardio and fat loss, and some body (answer choice C) argues that runners cannot get fat, would this weakened my argument above.  This is very similar to answer C on the question, just because you get married that doesn't mean that you will never be depressed.  You might be happily marry for en year and then one day you found out that your husband or wife had an affair with your best friend.  Furthermore, both of your parents are suffering from brain tumor.  Any reasonable person would be depressed.",

The government’s stockpile of helium is worth 25 percent more, at current market prices, than the debt accumulated in acquiring and storing it. Therefore, by selling the helium, the government can not only pay off that debt but reduce its overall debt as well. \n\nWhich of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Notice, conclusion is that selling helium will reduce the overall debt of the government.\n\nIn B, we are given that 25% of the total debt the government has accumulated in Stockpiling helium is not an insignificant portion. \n\nNegate it, 25% of the total debt the government has accumulated in Stockpiling helium is an insignificant portion. So, what is insignificant here?? Is it 1% or 30% or what? We don't know. May be its 30%. So, selling it may reduce that 30% amount. We are no where given the conclusion that the larger portion of the overall debt is reduced. So, whether its insignificant or significant, the debt is obviously going to reduce. hence, this statement doesn't shatter the conclusion. Hence, incorrect.\n\nNow, option D : Attempts to sell the government’s helium will not depress the market Price of helium by more than 25 percent.\n\nNegate it :  Attempts to sell the government’s helium will depress the market Price of helium by more than 25 percent. Now, since we are saying that the market price will be reduced by more than 25%, so it casts doubt whether we will be able to pay the debt. We are given that it is currently at 25% higher than its actual price. So, if the price is reduced by 25%, we may actually get the lower amount of money that would lead to not able to pay the helium price as well. Hence, the conclusion is shattered.\n\nlets say Helium bought at 100, Current price = 125, after selling reduced price  = 93.75, which is less than the original price.

        "question": "Sociologist: A contention of many of my colleagues—that the large difference between the wages of the highest- and lowest-paid workers will inevitably become a source of social friction—is unfounded. Indeed, the high differential should have an opposite effect, for it means that companies will be able to hire freely in response to changing conditions. Social friction arises not from large wage differences, but from wage levels that are static or slow changing.\n\nWhich one of the following is an assumption required by the sociologist’s argument?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This is a very difficult question because the argument has gigantic holes in it. The holes are so big that the argument seems to make no sense at all. I had to take my time with this one, and really try my hardest to connect the dots. This is a 9 out of 10 difficulty question.\n\nThe ultimate conclusion of the sociologist’s argument is that his colleagues who believe a large wage differential will inevitably cause social friction are wrong. The biggest hole in the argument is between the second and third sentence, so that’s probably where the necessary assumption is. In the second sentence, the sociologist offers, as a premise, that a large wage differential will enable companies to hire freely in response to changing conditions. I have no idea why this would be true, but if it’s a premise then I can’t argue with it. In the third sentence, the sociologist offers a premise that social friction arises from wage levels that are static or slow changing. What the hell does one thing have to do with the other? The sociologist seems to have assumed that if companies can hire freely in response to changing conditions, then wage levels will not be static or slow changing. The argument as a whole still makes no sense to me whatsoever, but if this statement is not true then the argument makes exactly zero sense. So that’s my prediction: “if companies can hire freely in response to changing conditions, then wage levels will not be static or slow changing.”\n\nA) Told you so. This is exactly like our prediction, so I’m 99 percent sure we’re right. If answer A is not true, the sociologist’s argument cannot possibly make sense. That’s the definition of something being “necessary” or “required.”\n\nB) There’s nothing about expectations in the argument, so this can’t be necessary.\n\nC) There’s nothing about financial caution in the argument either.\n\nD) The argument is not about benefiting workers.\n\nE) The argument is not about worker satisfaction.\n\nB through E are all irrelevant. Our answer is A because it links together the elements of the sociologist’s nonsensical argument.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

This belief is apparently correct since, of the one million clematis plants sold per year by the largest clematis nursery in North America, ten percent are .\n\nWhich of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of this passage is that the gardener's belief--that jackmanii is the most popular variety of clematis vine among gardeners in North America (NA)--is apparently correct. The word \"apparently\" is very important here. The conclusion would be substantially different if we were to replace \"apparently\" with \"definitely\".\n\nMore on that in a moment... but first, why does the author conclude that the belief is  correct?\n\n be in fact be the most popular variety at the nursery.\n\nWould that  that jackmanii is the most popular variety in NA? Not necessarily. But if jackmanii is #1 at the largest nursery, that's certainly EVIDENCE that jackmanii is #1 in NA. Again, we are trying to conclude that the belief is APPARENTLY correct, not that the believe is DEFINITELY correct. As long as we have evidence that jackmanii is the most popular variety among NA gardeners, we're in good shape.\n\nWith that in mind, let's look at the answer choices:\n\nIf the nursery sells 10 varieties or fewer, then there would HAVE to be another variety that accounts for more than 10% of the one million plants sold at the nursery. If that were true, then jackmanii could not be the most popular variety at the nursery. Thus, we would  have evidence that jackmanii is #1 in NA. Without choice (A), the argument falls apart.\n\nNow, does choice (A) PROVE that jackmanii is #1 at the nursery? Not at all... even with 20 varieties, there could be another type that accounts for more than 10% of the million. That, of course, would ruin the argument.\n\nEven if choice (A) is true, the argument may or may not be valid, but that's okay. In other words, choice (A) doesn't PROVE that the author's reasoning is sound. But without choice (A), the author's argument  be valid. This is a  assumption, so keep (A).\n\nThe nursery could sell many other types of plants. As long as jackmanii is the most popularity variety of  plant sold at the nursery, then the author's reasoning holds up. This is not a required assumption, so eliminate (B).\n \nIf a  portion of jackmanii sales were to gardeners outside of NA, then we might have a problem. That might suggest that jackmanii's popularity at the nursery is NOT a good indicator of jackmanii's popularity among NA gardeners.\n\nChoice (C) only says that SOME of the jackmanii are sold to gardeners outside of NA. In that case, the jackmanii sales at the nursery are probably a good indicator of its popularity among NA gardeners.\n\nDoes that make (C) a REQUIRED assumption? If (C) were not true and the nursery ONLY sold jackmanii to gardeners within NA, then that would probably further strengthen the argument. That would give us even more reason to believe that the sales at the nursery are a good indicator of NA popularity. Choice (C) is not a required assumption, so eliminate (C).\n\n \nIt doesn't matter whether clematis is a popular plant in general. The belief is that jackmanii is the most popular variety OF clematis. Even if only a tiny fraction of NA gardeners grow clematis, jackmanii could still be the most popular variety among those gardeners who DO grow clematis. Eliminate (D).\n\nThis is admittedly a little bit tempting: sure, it would strengthen the argument. But this isn't a strengthen question: we need to know whether this is NECESSARY to draw the conclusion. \n\nAnd it isn't necessary: even if (E) is NOT true -- for example, if jackmanii accounts for less than 10% of clematis plants at a few nurseries -- it's still possible that jackmanii is the most popular. And since (E) isn't necessary, it's not the correct answer.\n\n(A) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

Eliminate (B).\n\nThe author does not talk about  researchers will be able to restore the enzyme to normal levels. The author simply states that \"once that happens\", we will be able to eliminate periodontitis. It doesn't matter how long it takes researchers to develop those ways, so choice (C) can be eliminated.\n\nAs described for choice (B), there could be other factors leading to lowered levels of cathepsin C. Thus, even people who do not have the genetic mutation could have lowered levels of the enzyme. This would not disrupt the author's argument, which is that if we can restore the enzyme to normal levels, then we can eliminate periodontitis. Eliminate (D).\n\nWhat if there are other causes of periodontitis besides lowered levels of the enzyme? If that is the case, then restoring the enzyme to normal levels might not be sufficient for eliminating periodontitis. Thus, the author's argument depends on this assumption, and choice (E) is the correct answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "The rate of new drug development in Nation X has changed little over the last decade, even though, over the same period, the cost of developing a new drug has increased significantly. The patent system in Nation X, because it insulates drug developers from various market pressures, can be expected to produce this sort of cost explosion. Such patent protection allows firms to sell a drug at several times its free- market price for many years, and thus pharmaceutical companies have no incentive to minimize research costs. Greatly limiting the duration of these patent protections would promote more cost-efficient new drug development.\n\nThe proposal above relies on which of the following assumptions?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This statement is not an assumption that the author makes. The author concludes that limiting the duration of these patents would promote more cost-efficient new drug development. The conclusion doesn't rely on an assumption that the current patent protections create impediments to the development of new drugs. We have to find an assumption in the line of reasoning of the conclusion. Hence, this statement can be eliminated. \n\n\n\nYes! This is an assumption.\n\nThe author mentions that currently, such pharmaceutical companies have no incentive to minimize research costs and that patent protection allows firms to sell a drug at several times its free-market price for many years. Based on these two considerations the author concludes that limiting the duration of these patent protections would promote more cost-efficient new drug development. Hence, the author assumes and believes that the limitation will ensure that companies take measures to ensure cost-efficient new drug development. We are already presented with information stating one of the reasons that the cost of developing a new drug has increased is the absence of any incentive to minimize research costs. Hence, the author has assumed that the market pressure will lead to a reduction in research costs, making drug development more cost-effective.\n\n\n\nThe conclusion of the author is to make drug development more cost-effective. The presented information is not an assumption of the conclusion. Eliminate C.\n\n\n\nThis is not an assumption. We know that patent protection allows firms to sell a drug at several times its free-market price for many years. However, this doesn't mean that the companies are exaggerating their research costs to consumers. The companies are probably using outdated technologies or research methodologies probably for which they are incurring high research costs or companies are simply lazy that they are not optimizing processes well or are wasting resources etc. As the costs are ultimately passed onto the consumers, they have no incentive to minimize the costs. We need not assume the companies are exaggerating their research costs; the costs may well be actual expenses. Eliminate D.\n\n\n\nOut of scope.

        "question": "In 1963, a young macaque monkey was observed venturing into a hot spring to retrieve food which had fallen in. Soon, other macaques began to enter the spring, and over a few years this behavior was adopted by the entire troop. Prior to 1963, no macaques had ever been observed in the hot spring; by 1990, the troop was regularly spending time there during the winters. Thus, these macaques are able to adopt and pass on new patterns of social behavior, and are not complete captives of their genetic heritage.\n\nWhich one of the following is an assumption required by the argument above?\n\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is a Necessary Assumption question. The conclusion of the argument asserts that the observed macaque behavior has been passed on socially, and that macaques are therefore “not complete captives” of their genetic heritage. There is no evidence in the argument about genetics. My question to the speaker is, “Are social behaviors and genetic instincts completely separate?” My idea is that maybe macaques pass on social behaviors because they are genetically “programmed” to do so. If this were true, then the second half of the author’s argument would fail. So it seems as if the author has assumed that this social behavior was not caused by genetic programming. Let’s see.\n\nA) If this were true, it would only weaken the author’s argument. So it can’t be the answer.\n\nB) This almost exactly matches our prediction. If this statement is not true, the author’s argument fails. That’s how we know for sure that it’s an assumption required by the author’s argument. (It’s a necessary assumption.)\n\nC) I don’t know what this means and I don’t much care, because B is such a good answer.\n\nD) This answer choice goes way too far. The author hasn’t assumed that social behaviors and genetic heritage are  separate. Necessary Assumption questions tend to like answer choices that are more weakly stated. (Sufficient Assumption questions tend to like stronger answer choices, but this isn’t a Sufficient Assumption question.)\n\nE) The author doesn’t assume this. It’s irrelevant.\n\nOur answer is B, because if is untrue then the argument fails.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

This is a causative statement where the Paleo links cold to population decline, with a keyword \"indirectly\". So, in previous statement, the Paleo opined that cold did not lead to death of bottom dwelling creatures and provided a reason for the same. In this statement, Paleo introduces his own theory of how cold might have effected bottom dwelling creatures. So, this statement could be called an opinion or conclusion or judgement or hypothesis of the Paleo.\n\n6.  - This is BF2. This says that Plankton suffered a sever population decline. Read this statement with the preceding statement, which said Plankton was food for bottom dwelling creatures. So, combining these statements, we find that the food of bottom dwelling creatures declined severely.

(A) can be eliminated.\n\nThe argument seeks to EVALUATE the practice rather than EXPLAIN it. Furthermore, the second BF portion does not serve to explain the practice, so (B) can be eliminated.\n\nThe first BF portion does introduce a company practice that the argument seeks to evaluate, but the second simply states that there are other ways to achieve the goals of that practice.

        "explanation": "So this is a pretty lengthy argument, but it is one argument that progressively advances toward the main conclusion.  That eliminates answer choices A and B immediately, because there is nothing contradictory to the argument that is presented.  The argument can be summarized as follows:\n\nP) Cork stoppers have problems that result in wasted inventory\nP) Bottlemaster plastic stoppers do not have these problems\nP) Bottlemaster plastic stoppers are slightly more expensive than traditional cork stoppers\nP) Cork prices are going to rise dramatically\nIntermediate Conclusion) Winemakers who use cork but wish to keep production costs low will have to reconsider plastic stoppers\nP) Public's negative association with plastic wine stoppers is declining\nUltimate Conclusion) Bottlemaster plastic stoppers will gain an increased market share\n\nVeritas teaches a great technique of the \"why test.\"  Any conclusion must be supported with reasons in the argument, and the ultimate conclusion here is supported by the fact that the public is no longer so negative about plastic stoppers and winemakers who currently use cork stoppers but who wish to keep production costs low are going to need to reconsider using plastic stoppers.  Veritas also teaches something that I refer to as the \"reverse why test.\"  This states that any ultimate conclusion of an argument cannot serve as the \"why\" to something else - it is in no way a premise.  I like to think of it as the \"end of the line.\"  Here the intermediate conclusion (as we just saw) is also a conclusion, because it is supported by the fact that the plastic stoppers are a good substitution for the cork stoppers, and cork stoppers are going to rise drastically.  It then itself, however, serves as a \"why\" to the main conclusion, as we just saw, meaning that it cannot itself be the main conclusion - it does not pass the \"reverse why test.\" \n\nThat makes answer choice E the correct answer.  Both C and D incorrectly cite the intermediate conclusion as the main conclusion.\n\nI hope this helps!",

        "question": "Historian: In the Drindian Empire, censuses were conducted annually to determine the population of each village.  This very completeness makes one point stand out; in five different years, villages overwhelmingly reported significant population declines. Tellingly, each of those five years immediately followed an increase in a certain Drindian tax. This tax, which was assessed on villages, was computed by the central government using the annual census figures. Obviously, whenever the tax went up, villages had an especially powerful economic incentive to minimize the number of people they recorded; and concealing the size of a village’s population from government census takers would have been easy. \n\nIn the historian’s argument, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles? \n",
        "answer": "Added OA",
        "explanation": "are remarkably complete.; and concealing the size of a village's population from government census takers would have been easy. Therefore, the reported declines probably did not happen.\n\n\n\n\nA) The first presents a finding to support the position the historian seeks to establish ; the second is a consideration that has been used to argue against that position.\n\nB) The first provides a context for certain evidence that supports the position that the historian seeks to establish ; the second is the judgment advanced to support that position.\n\nC) The first is a position that the historian seeks to establish ; the second is evidence that has been used to argue against that position.\n\nD) The first is an assumption that the historian explicitly makes in support of a certain position ; the second is that position.\n\nE) The first is the claim that the historian rejects ; the second is a conclusion drawn to justify that rejection.\n\nThe Official answer to this question is B. I am still not convinced with the OA.\n\nWhile researching for basic concepts I stumbled upon the  , which says that- \n\nKeep in mind the huge difference between evidence and a conclusion or position.  Evidence is always fact, stone cold fact — “Unemployment numbers rose“, “This company bought that company“, “this medicine has such-and-such side effects.”  Sometimes evidence is given as something one of the voices in the argument “says” or “points out.”  Evidence is always about what actually happened in the objective world: in most arguments, the evidence itself is beyond dispute, and what the argument is about is how to interpret the evidence.\n\nA conclusion is an interpretation, a deduction, based on the evidence.  Someone else who accepts the evidence may or may not accept a given conclusion based on the evidence.   Look for signal words, such as since, because, therefore, “we can conclude that“, etc.\n\nA position is any opinion or point of view someone might hold — “I think Q is right” or “I think people who think Q is right are crazy!” or “People who dismiss the believers of Q are being unfair.” — those are positions. Anything that is an opinion or a judgment based on the evidence is a position: in particular, the conclusion of the argument is the position that the argument as a whole takes. \n\nBased on the above can we say that Position is a kind of Intermediate Conclusion, not the final or main conclusion.\n\nPlease help me in his question and also in discovering one more term \"Judgement\" in context to GMAT reasoning.,\nI'm happy to respond, my friend.  \" and a \"\" --- these words can be used more or less interchangeably.   Similarly, they are more or less interchangeable with \".\"  All of these mean something that one person with one point of view thinks.  They are all different from evidence, which is the material beyond dispute, the material about which everyone is in agreement.  \n\nIn this argument, the first bold statement is: \".\" This is evidence.  This is a factual and unambiguous.   Anyone can do an see this complete list of census records.  This is beyond dispute.  Notice, this is not evidence that supports the argument: the next sentence is really the evidence for the arguments.  This sentence provides what we might call background information.   \n\nBTW, the word \"\" is close to evidence: it is something that anyone simply would find when they are looking in the right place.   \n\nThe second bold statement is: \" .\"  The word \"\" is not part of the bold statement, but I include it because it is word used rhetorically to bolster a claim that someone is making.  This statement is not unambiguous fact: this is someone's interpretation of what has happened.  This is a claim, a position, a conclusion, a judgment, an argument.  Often, the GMAT will use the word \"\" to mean the biggest claim of the argument, and will use one of these other terms to distinguish a smaller claim from this.   Arguments in the real world are not so simple, but the cookbook arguments of GMAT CR follow this pattern.   \n\nNow, we can look at the argument.  Here are the statements about the first BF statement, which is a totally factual statement that provides background for the evidence most relevant to the argument.   \n\nA)  = seems reasonable \nB)  = seems reasonable \nC)  =   =   =  . =  the historian's main conclusion.  \nB) ... . = seems reasonable\nC) ... . = . = seems reasonable, but doesn't work with first part.  \nE) ... . = .  \n\nDoes all this make sense?\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)",

After all, apparently, some people are objecting that that phenomenon indicates that the police chief's conclusion is not valid while the police chief is saying that that phenomenon is the result of the city's police department having \"introduced new strategies.\"\n\nSo, we have to be careful not to choose this choice just because the first part could be correct.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice starts off like choice (A). So, the first part could be considered correct for the reason we discussed when considering choice (A): The fact that \"\" could be considered a phenomenon whose interpretataion is at issue.

At the same time, we could get the impression that the first part of this choice is correct because the police chief does argue against how some people have interpreted the fact presented by the first boldface portion.\n\nIn the case of the second boldface portion, it does not supply a reason for the police chief \"question the accuracy\" of the first. At the same time, we could get the impression that the second part of this choice is correct because the police chief does use the second boldface portoin to challenge an interpretation of the first boldface portion. So, the second part of this choice is somewhat similar to the role of the second boldface portion.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe first part of this choice is correct because the fact that \"\" has been used as evidence to support the hypothesis that, contrary to the police chief's conclusion, \"Megalopolis' crime rate would probably have declined even without the new policing strategies.\"\n\nThe second part of this choice is correct because the police chief uses the fact that the city's police department's new policing strategties \"\" as evidence to support the police chief's conclusion that the new strategies \"should be credited with bringing about the decline\" and to weaken the support for the objection to that conclusion.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThis choice correcty describes the role of the first boldface portion.

This matches answer B. \n\nThe phrase that precedes the first bold bit can be helpful in eliminating tempting wrong answers. \" have questioned...\" indicates that what follows is not necessarily the author's opinion. Indeed, we know from the author's conclusion that the author confidently answers 'no' to the question posed by 'some'\n\nSo the first bold bit is a question posed by somebody else (a question that the author's conclusion answers 'no' to). In other words, the first bold bit is definitely not evidence for the author's conclusion. So E can't be correct. \n\nComparing verbs in answer choices can be a good way to find answers that get the opinion wrong.  Answer A) starts \"the first ...\" Answer B) starts \"the first \" One big difference is that 'question' is opinionated and 'gives' is not. Even though A repeats a word from the prompt, A suggests that the author is doing the questioning; answer A suggests that the author is skeptical of her own conclusion. In contrast, answer B doesn't give the author any opinion that isn't hers.",

Choice (D) says absolutely nothing about SuperOXY, and the argument doesn't care at all about any of these other potential factors.

Here, the conclusion of the argument appears in the last sentence, that “these findings suggest that the real reason why musicians over thirty rarely make significant contributions to the musical canon is not that they have aged but rather that they have spent too much time as musicians.” This conclusion is drawn in contrast to the conventional explanation that age erodes creative ability, which appears in the first boldface.

The website owners dispute the charge stating that they only rented out only 8,000 apartments through their website.

Miami@50 rents apartments at a much lower price then it rents hotel rooms. \n\n\nB. Miami@50 rented out at least 8  times as many hotel room nights bookings as \napartments. \n\n\nC.

We know that decreasing market share led to a decrease in the workforce, so there must be some outside factor that is affecting the usual correlation between the size of the company and the\nnumber of workers needed.\n\nChoice (A) is incorrect, as it doesn't give us any change at all, let alone any details that apply directly to Kaiba's situation. Choice (B) tells us something new about Kaiba (their reliance on contractors) that suggests they don't need employees of their own. If they can grow without new employees, and it has had a positive effect on their business, it makes sense that they wouldn't hire new employees as they expand. This looks like a solid choice.\n\nChoice (C) is irrelevant, as it doesn't address employment figures at all. (D) is also irrelevant. We aren't concerned with the specific employees that Kaiba\nlaid of in the past; we care about Kaiba's employment numbers. (E) is on the right track, but if the current workforce is only \"at least as productive\" as it was before, it would seem to need more employees as it grows. If the current workforce were substantially more productive, they might not need more workers, but we don't know if that's the case.

Initially Even I was inclined towards C because, The child remains as the child only that his/her thoughts or personality is under debate. It is our general outside knowledge makes us think in a manner that environment would have an impact on child and hence sowing tomatoes gives tomatoes but not necessarily good ones due to of environmental impact. But as per the argument there is little or no environmental impact so sowing tomatoes gives tomatoes (the exact ones) but not daffodils or cucumber.\n\nAlso, more importantly the argument never mentions that the child becomes bad due to environment and upbringing.

Protectionist trade restrictions serve particular interests and only rarely also the general welfare. But the U.S. Constitution requires the government to serve the general welfare. It follows that ____________.\n\nWhich of the following best completes the passage?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The passage is a set of statements of fact about protectionist trade restrictions.\n\nThen, the last sentence is \"It follows that __________.\"\n\n\"It follows that\" is a way to introduce a conclusion that follows from, in other words, is supported by, facts that precede \"It follows that.\" So, the choice that fills the blank and completes the passage must be a conclusion that logically follows from the statements in the passage.\n\n\n\nThis is a Complete the Passage question, and the correct answer will logically complete the passage, in this case by stating a conclusion that follows from the statements in the passage.\n\n\n\nThis choice is so tempting, and it's a good example of why we should go through the other choices even if we think we've found the answer. \n\nAfter all, this choice could seem to follow from the statements in the passage since the passage says, \"Protectionist trade restrictions serve particular interests and only rarely also the general welfare. But the U.S. Constitution requires the government to serve the general welfare.\"\n\nTo avoid choosing this choice, we can do two things. One is see that (C) is pretty similar and thus could be correct as well. The second is to notice that the passage says that \"Protectionist trade restrictions .\"\n\nThe fact that protectionist trade restrictions \"rarely\" serve the general welfare means that they sometimes do serve the general welfare. So, in some cases, trade restrictions  constitutional.\n\nAccordingly, it does not follow that, as this choice says, \"trade restrictions of any kind are unconstitutional.\"\n\nEliminate\n\n\n\nTo an extent, this choice logically follows from the part of the passage that says, \"Protectionist trade restrictions harm large segments of society for the benefit of a smaller segment. For example, every time the steel industry asks for tariffs on steel imports from foreign countries, someone correctly points out that if that wish were granted, it would harm the United States auto industry and other steel users, not to mention consumers.\"\n\nAfter all, given what that part of the passage says about trade restricions harming the United States auto industry and other steel users, it's logical that, if there are no trade restrictions and thus there is foreign competition, U.S. domestic industries will probably be helped by that competition.\n\nAt the same time, this choice isn't correct because it's not a conclusion that follows from the passage as a whole or from the last sentences of the passage in particular. It follows from only that one earlier part of the passage.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is correct because it follows from the passage as a whole and from the last sentences in particular.\n\nAfter all, given what the passage says, \"Protectionist trade restrictions .

Rather, the passage is mostly discussion of protectionist trade restrictions, and what precedes the sentence with the blank is the following:\n\n\n\nSo, we can see that the conclusion that fills the blank must follow not just from the sentence about the U.S. Constition but also from the sentences that precede that sentence, which are about trade restrictions.\n\nSo, this choice doesn't logically fill the blank because it follows from only the last sentence of the passage and not from everything in the passage that precedes the blank.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice conficts with what the passage says since the passage says \"Protectionist trade restrictions serve ... only rarely also the general welfare.\" After all, if protectionist trade restrictions only rarely serve the general welfare, then it's not true that \"the general welfare requires protectionist trade restrictions.\"\n\nA choice that conflicts with the passage is not something that \"follows\" from what the passage says.\n\nEliminate.\n\n C­",

But making hydrogen requires fuel, which otherwise could be used to generate electricity, heat, or mechanical power directly. To run our hybrid cars and light our homes, for example, we can generate electricity in small, efficient plants fueled by natural gas.

The premise is that even though hydrogen is a powerful source of energy, hydrogen requires fuel to make, fuel that could otherwise be used in other industries. The passage then gives an example of how using natural gas to convert into hydrogen and then electricity, while it powers our homes and electric cars, causes environmental damages.\n\nFrom this summary, it seems like what the passage is concluding is that making hydrogen energy isn't worth the side effects.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nA) While the passage says that converting natural gas to hydrogen and electricity causes lower efficiency, there's nothing in the passage suggesting which energy source is the MOST efficient energy source. Answer choices that use absolutes are usually wrong (not always though)\nB) This is the opposite of what the passage says, it says that converting natural gas to hydrogen and electricity (which is then used by the hybrid cars) is what actually CAUSES increases in greenhouse gas emissions.\nC) There is no mention about price points at any given point in the passage, irrelevant.\n This matches our originally drawn conclusion, since at the end the passage even says that natural gas to hydrogen to electricity conversion leads to an increase in harmful greenhouse gas emissions.\nE) The first part of this answer choice is correct, however, where it goes wrong is in stating that it's too short in supply, because there is no mention of supply anywhere in the passage.

Let's do that for this example: \nTo find the conclusion drawn by the argument as a whole, it is important to understand the role of each piece of the passage:  \n\n made by some paleontologists: \"Apatosaurus, a huge dinosaur, was able to gallop.\"  \"This\" refers back to the suggestion introduced in the first sentence. to support this conclusion: \"because galloping would probably have broken Apatosaurus’s legs.\"  The word \"because\" is a good hint that this piece of the passage supports the conclusion, because it shows a causal relationship between the two bits of information.  From the analysis above, we know that \"galloping would probably have broken Apatosaurus’s legs\"  the author's overall conclusion.  Because this answer choice does not express the conclusion of the passage, (A) is out. \n\nThis information explains how we know the provided evidence is correct. It is not the conclusion of the argument, so (B) is out.\n\nThis is more like it. The author's overall point is that the \"suggestion\" that \"Apatosaurus, a huge dinosaur, was able to gallop\" is \"unlikely.\"  This answer choice maps very nicely to the conclusion as written in the passage.  (C) is our answer.\n\nYou state in your analysis that \"D states something that can be inferred.\" We are not looking for an inference (or an assumption on which the argument depends, as might be the case here). We are looking for the answer choice that \"most accurately expresses the conclusion drawn by the argument.\" With a clear understanding of the passage, we know that (D) does not at all state the author's conclusion.  (D) is out.\n\nAgain, this might be an assumption on which the argument depends, or could be seen as a strengthener for the author's argument.

It could seem to be correct since, given that there are 100 people in the senate and 15 women were elected to it in 1970 while 54 women were elected to it in 1990, it must be the case that there were more men in the senate in 1970 than in 1990.

It's about \"the proportion of successful candidates among those men who ran for seats in Wilsonia’s senate.\"\n\nTo know the proportion of successful candidates among those who ran, we need to know not just the number of successful candidates but also the total number of men who ran for seats. After all, the proportion of candidates who were successful is \" role=\"presentation\">.\n\nSo, without information on the total number of men candidates, we don't have support for this choice.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is not logically supported.\n\nAfter all, for 1970, we have only the number of women elected and not the number who ran.\n\nFor 1990, we have the number of women elected and have the fact that the proportion of successful women candidates was lower than that for 1970, which means that more, rather than fewer, women ran in 1990 than in 1970, as we will see in considering choice (D).\n\nFinally, we have no information at all on how many men ran either year.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nRegarding women who ran for seats in the senate in the two years, we know the following:\n\n 15 women elected to the senate\n\n 54 women elected to the senate\n\n The proportion of successful candidates among those women who ran for seats in Wilsonia’s senate was no higher than it had been in 1970.\n\n    That means:\n\n    \" role=\"presentation\">\" role=\"presentation\">\n\n\n\n\n\nSince , we can see that .\n\nSo, this choice is well supported.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThis choice is not supported since we have information on only the number of women who were elected in each year.

(So in 1964, their spending was less than 3.2% and 1.6% respectively and they increased it to these numbers by 1978)\n\n(a)\tThere is direct relationship between the size of a nation’s GNP and the number of inventions it produces. \nNo link given between the site of GNP and number of inventions in the argument. We might think that often, this will be the case but we are asked for the conclusion supported by the argument given. Hence this will not be our answer.\n\n(b)\tJapan and Germany spent more money on research and development in 1978 than did the United States \nWe don't know the relative GNP of the three countries and hence we cannot say who actually spent more/less money.\n\n(c)\tThe amount of money a nation spends on research and development is directly related to the number of inventions patented in that nation.\nAgain, the link is not given in the argument. All we are given is that in US, in a certain time frame, number of patents reduced and % of GNP spent on R&amp;D reduced. There is no connection between number roof patents and money spent. Also, even if money spent had also reduced in US in that time frame, it doesn't imply that that will always be the case. A nation could spend a ton of money on R&amp;D but be unable to come up with any inventions.\n\n(d)\tBetween 1964 and 1978 the United States consistently spent a larger percentage of its GNP on research and development than did Japan. \nFrom 1964 to 1978, Japan increased its % of GNP spending on R &amp; D from a smaller value (say 1%) to 1.6%.\nFrom 1964 to 1978, US decreased its % of GNP spending on R &amp; D from 3% to 2.2%.\nIn this entire time frame, US is spending more (as a % of GNP) than Japan. Hence, this is correct.\n\n(e)\tBoth West Germany and Japan will soon surpass the United States in the number of patents granted to inventors. \nWe have no numbers on the number of patents of both countries hence we cannot conclude this.\n\nAnswer (D)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

Indeed, I would not disagree if you pointed out that intentionally causing such effects is reprehensible, other things being equal. But in asking you to concur with me that Hogan’s actions not be wholly condemned I emphasize again that Hogan mistakenly believed Winters to be the robber who had been terrorizing west-side apartment buildings for the past several months. \n\nWhich one of the following most accurately expresses the conclusion of the argument?\n\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of this argument is difficult to identify because the author does not use a traditional conclusion indicator. The first three sentences are admissions by the author regarding the nature of Hogan’s actions. The fourth sentence contains the conclusion and a premise, and the conclusion is that “Hogan’s actions should not be wholly condemned.” If you struggled to identify the conclusion, consider how you might have applied the Conclusion Identification Methodology to the pieces of the argument. For example, consider the two parts of the last sentence. If you thought one of them might be the conclusion, place one as the conclusion and the other as a premise, as follows: “Because I ask that Hogan’s actions not be wholly condemned, therefore I emphasize again that Hogan mistakenly believed Winters to be the robber who had been terrorizing west-side apartment buildings for the past several months.” Does that configuration sound right? No. Try again by reversing the premise and conclusion pieces: “Because Hogan mistakenly believed Winters to be the robber who had been terrorizing west-side apartment buildings for the past several months, therefore I ask you to concur with me that Hogan’s actions not be wholly condemned.” The relationship now sounds much more logical. \n\nAnswer choice (A): The author admits that Hogan fully realized his actions and the author asks that “Hogan’s actions not be wholly condemned.” Both of these statements are counter to the idea that Hogan should not be considered responsible for Winter’s injuries. \n\nAnswer choice (B): The only reference to the robber is that Hogan mistakenly believed that Winters was the robber. Thus, there is no evidence in the stimulus to support this answer. \n\n\n\nAnswer choice (D): According to the information in the stimulus, this answer must be true. Regardless, the answer is still incorrect because it fails to summarize the author’s main point.

In the same year, the Song Factory Record Company spent 20% of its total budget on the production of 10 albums and 60% of its budget on the marketing of these albums. Making Hits sold a total of 800,000 copies of the ten records it produced in 2003, while the Song Factory sold a total of 1,600,000 copies of the ten records it produced in 2003. \n\nAssuming each company met its budget, which of the following conclusions is best supported by the information given above?\n\n",
        "answer": "Edited the question.",
        "explanation": "When drawing a conclusion, we must remember not to conclude too much; i.e., do not make unwarranted assumptions. In this case, we are looking for the conclusion that must be true based only on the information given in the passage without requiring any additional assumptions.\n\n(A) While we are given information about the percentage of the total budgets spent on marketing, we have no information about the actual amount of money either company spent on marketing.\n\n(B) While we are given information about the percentage of the total budgets spent on production, we have no information about the actual amount of money either company spent on production.\n\n(C) Because we have no information on the sale price per copy for either company, we cannot make any conclusions about the revenue generated by either company. It’s very possible that Making Hits sold its copies at twice the price of the Song Factory copies, in which case the revenues for the two companies would be the same.\n\n Since Making Hits spent 40% of its budget on production, 30% on marketing, and the rest on overhead, we can conclude that Making Hits spent 30% of its budget on overhead. Since the Song Factory spent 20% of its budget on production and 60% on marketing, and met its budget, it could not have spent more than 20% on overhead. Therefore, Making Hits spent a higher percentage of its budget on overhead than did the Song Factory.\n\n(E) A valid conclusion must be true. While it is possible, and perhaps even likely, that the percentage of the budget spent on marketing was a driver of sales, this is not necessarily true; there are many other factors that could have affected sales. For example, it is possible that the Song Factory sold more copies of its 10 albums because the music was better than the music produced at Making Hits, and not because the Song Factory spent a higher percentage on marketing.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "Scurvy is a disease caused by a severe deficiency of the water-soluble vitamin C; left untreated, the condition can cause death. During an expedition in the sixteenth century, Frankian sailors began to develop scurvy when their ships became entrenched in thick ice, forcing them to winter in the area. Many began to die. Upon visiting the camp, Donnacona natives introduced a tea made exclusively from spruce nettles, a drink that, when ingested, led to the recovery of the sailors afflicted with scurvy. It was not until the eighteenth century that citrus, a type of fruit high in vitamin C, was recommended for use by sailors to combat scurvy.\n\nWhich of the following conclusions can be most reasonably drawn from the information in the passage?\n\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "would prove somewhat difficult, but I had no idea that, as of this writing 24 hours after the fact, answer accuracy would stand at just 19 percent. Apparently, the Deccan Traps lived up to their name as a Sentence Correction topic.\n\nBefore we get into this question, some fun facts: \n\nThis question is pretty generic, in all honesty, in the sense that its broad applicability could point us in any of a number of directions regarding the information in the passage. It is just this sort of question that dissuades me from pre-thinking at times, since the answers themselves will have to provide a framework for assessment.\n\n- Sentence one provides background information about scurvy, both what causes it and what it causes under certain conditions.\n\n- Sentence two tells us about an ill-fated expedition in which .\n\n- Sentence three is as simple a sentence as can be: many sailors started to die.\n\n- Sentence four introduces a different group of people, Donnacona natives, and informs us that a spruce nettle tea they brought with them cured the scurvy-stricken sailors of the disease.\n\n- Sentence five then shifts to two centuries later and provides further information on the connection between vitamin C and scurvy.\n\nIt is against this backdrop that we need to compare the answers. I leave my mental mapping simple to encourage further referencing of the passage, since a crucial CR skill is to stick to  what the passage lays out.\n\n the sailors of scurvy  it had been presented in a water-based form such as tea. does match up well with  from the opening line, but this answer focuses on the vehicle for a remedy rather than on the contents: water alone is not said in the passage to treat vitamin C deficiency. Some inherent quality of spruce nettles must exist instead.\n\nIf this were untrue, then based on the information in the passage, there is no way that a tea made  from spruce nettles. To piggyback off of the previous answer, we can speculate that spruce nettles themselves may have bound water inside, that perhaps chewing the nettles or soaking them in water releases their contents to make them more bioavailable. Although such a consideration is not necessary to answer this question, it may help you to steer clear of a trap answer such as (A). In short, there is nothing to argue against here, and that is why we should choose it. Remember Occam's razor (boiled down—sorry, I like puns): the simplest explanation is usually correct.\n\n they had been able to drink the spruce nettle tea in time. have happened, since we only know what  happen, even if the question stem asks us to infer. Again, do not overlook the obvious. Although the passage states that  recovered upon ingesting the tea, it also informs us that the expedition was put on pause, more or less, because the ships were stuck in  water. Many sailors could have died from the harsh winter conditions before scurvy had a chance to finish them off. We simply do not know.\n\n between vitamin C deficiency and scurvy hundreds of years prior to the recommendations made in the eighteenth century.. found in citrus. Besides, since when does a recommendation mean that the information surrounding that advice is factual? (Think of a bad recommendation you have gotten at some point in your life—e.g., it will be fun to throw rocks at that hornets' nest.) Finally, if we feel ready to commit to such a link, then all signs should point to (B) as the correct answer instead. Evidently, spruce must contain vitamin C.\n\nI hope that helps clear up any confusion. It was a fun question to tinker with, mixing fact and fiction (in those nonsensical proper nouns the GMAT™ often likes to use) and incorporating my interests in history, medicine, and, of course, logic games.\n\nLet the competition roll on!\n\n- Andrew\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "Plantings of cotton bioengineered to produce its own insecticide against bollworms, a major cause of crop failure, sustained little bollworm damage until this year. This year the plantings are being seriously damaged by bollworms. Bollworms, however, are not necessarily developing resistance to the cotton's insecticide. Bollworms breed on corn, and last year more corn than usual was planted throughout cotton-growing regions. So it is likely that the cotton is simply being overwhelmed by corn-bred bollworms.\n\nIn evaluating the argument, which of the following would be most useful to establish?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The passage says that this year's cotton plantings are being seriously damaged by bollworms. The conclusion of the passage is that \"it is likely that the cotton is simply being overwhelmed by corn-bred bollworms.\" Let's review the author's argument:\n\n that the cotton is simply being overwhelmed by corn-bred bollworms.\" We have two possible explanations... is the second one ? \n\nIn evaluating the author's argument/conclusion, which of the following would be most useful to establish?\n\nThis offers a possible  to the problem described in the second explanation, but we need something that helps us determine whether the second explanation is even accurate. In other words, choice (A) provides a possible  without helping us determine whether the  is accurate. Thus, choice (A) does not help us evaluate the author's argument and can be eliminated.\n\nThe passage states that \"last year more corn than usual was planted throughout cotton-growing regions.\" Notice that this does NOT specifically say that more corn was planted only among the bioengineered cotton. Thus, if the author's conclusion is accurate, we would expect an increase in bollworm damage  those cotton-growing regions, not just to the bioengineered plantings.\n\nIn other words, if the bollworms are coming from corn, and there is now more corn throughout cotton-growing regions, there should be increased damage to ALL cotton in those regions. If that were not the case, we would have reason to question the author's conclusion. Choice (B) would be useful in evaluating the argument, so hang on to this one.\n\nWe don't care about other crops. We KNOW that the bioengineered cotton plants successfully resisted the bollworms for years, and we need to figure out why they are suddenly being damaged by the bollworms. Choice (C) does not help us evaluate the explanations described in the passage, so eliminate this one.\n\nWe are specifically told that this year's plantings are being seriously damaged , and we need to evaluate the explanations posed by the author. Information about other pests is irrelevant, so eliminate (D).\n\nWe are not looking for ways to SOLVE the new problem. Rather, we need to evaluate WHY the problem has developed.

The device is intended to help doctors decide whether an athlete who has received a blow to the head during a competition should be sent back into the game.\n\nWhich of the following would it be most useful to establish in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the device for its intended purpose?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "- Apparently, a new device can determine how severe a concussion is. How does it do it? By reading the brain’s signals and comparing the signals with a compilation of scans.\n\n - The device is meant to solve a specific sports problem. Should an athlete who has injured the head during a competition be sent back into the game? The device is intended to help doctors decide this.\n\n\nWe need to evaluate the effectiveness of the device in helping doctors decide whether to send an athlete with a blow to the head back into a game. Two things come to mind:\n\nDoes the device report the severity accurately? Is the method of scanning brains for signals and comparing them with a database of scans a proper one?\n\nAre the doctors capable of making an informed decision about an injured athlete’s return to the game based on the output of the device? Let’s say the device gives a reading in “severity units”. And let’s say the reading for a player is 750 severity units. Is this value too high? Is it within the feasible range to let the player go back into the game? Are there established standards that the doctors can map the readings against? Or, are the doctors informed enough to interpret these readings to make informed decisions? We don’t want players to go back into the game and end up even worse, after all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n the device. However, we need to evaluate whether the device is  in helping make the decision, not whether, till now, the doctors would have gained from the device. Here’s an example to help explain it:\nSay, a mother asks her son to wear a helmet before riding his motorbike. The son refuses to wear the helmet citing the fact that he hasn’t received a head injury while riding his bike till date. However, not having needed a helmet till now does not indicate that the helmet is not effective in helping prevent injuries. The helmet is probably very well effective; it’s just that the son hasn’t needed it yet. However, the helmet may help him in the future.\n\nPurport: Appear or claim to be or do something, especially falsely; profess.

Fortunately, repaving with concrete is no more expensive than repaving with asphalt.\n\nWhich of the following would it be most useful for the county to determine in assessing whether the plan would achieve its goal?\n",
        "answer": "E",

So, since it doesn't include a stated conclusion, we have to find the implied conclusion, which will basically be that the goal of the plan will be achieved. The goal is the following:\n\n\n\nSo, the implied conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nWe see that, the county has reasoned that, since concrete is affected less by heat and repaving with concrete is no more expensive than repaving with asphalt, the county will save money by repaving with concrete.\n\n\n\nThis is an Evaluate question. So, the correct answer will be the one such that different answers to the question it presents will weaken or strengthen the case for believing the plan will work.\n\n\n\nAnswers to this question won't affect the argument since, regardless of whether concrete stays the coolest, it should stay cooler than the asphalt it replaces.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nAnswers to this question won't affect the argument since the goal is to save money, not time, and since, regardless of how long it takes to repave with concrete, the passage has already stated as fact that \"repaving with concrete is no more expensive than repaving with asphalt.\"\n\nSo, regardless of whether it takes longer to repave with concrete, the county would by doing so spend no more than it would by repaving with asphalt.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe stated goal is \"to save on its road maintenance costs.\"\n\nSo, the answers to this question won't affect the strength of the argument since, even if concrete roads present some safety hazards not presented by asphalt roads, the maintenance costs would not be affected by that fact.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is tricky because the number of roads that need to be completely repaved will affect the county's road maintenance costs.\n\nAt the same time, we can see why this choice is incorrect by noticing that the conclusion is not about total costs. It's about saving on costs.\n\nRegardless of how high the total maintenance costs will be, repaving with concrete could make them lower than they would have been.\n\nSo, the answers to this question will not affect the strength of the argument since, regardless of how many roads will need to be repaved, the county could still save by repaving with concrete instead of asphalt.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is interesting because it brings up a new factor. We already know that repaving with concrete is no more expensive than repaving with asphalt, and we know that concrete road will likely need fewer repairs than asphalt roads, but what about the cost of repairs to concrete roads?\n\nIf the answer to the question presented by this choice is that it costs more to repair concrete roads, then the case for the plan is weakened because the greater costs of repairs  will offset, and possibly exceed, the savings associated with having to repair less frequently.\n\nOn the other hand, if the answer is that it costs the same or less to repair concrete roads, then the case for the plan is strengthened since that information helps to confirm that the county will save by repaving with concrete.\n\nSo, knowing how the costs of repairing compare helps with determining whether the plan would achieve its goal.\n\nKeep.\n\n B­",

One need only consider the information gathered on native North American raptors, such as bald eagles and peregrine falcons.

        "explanation": "The conclusion of the argument is that the rate of extinction of bird species will not surge in this century. Evidence from native North American raptors (birds of prey) is cited: namely, that even though several such species nearly vanished between 1900 and 1970, the populations of these birds have since rebounded. We are asked to select a question which would, when answered, provide information that would help us evaluate this claim.\n\n(A) This answer choice inquires about the introduction of non-native raptors. However, the argument cites as evidence the resurgence in native raptor populations. Thus, this question does not shed light on the relevance of the evidence.\n\n This question points to an unwarranted assumption on the author's part. The author assumes that the rebound in native North American raptor populations since 1970 was not due to any special effort to save these species. If special efforts have been made to save these raptor species, then one might not be able to generalize this evidence to other bird species or to make predictions about population trends in the next century, using this evidence.\n\n(C) This question is irrelevant: the argument does not depend in any way on the experience of the zoologists. It hinges instead on the trend in raptor populations that the author uses to justify his or her point.\n\n(D) This question is irrelevant.

        "question": "Tanco, a leather manufacturer, uses large quantities of common salt to preserve animal hides. New environmental regulations have significantly increased the cost of disposing of salt water that results from this use, and, in consequence, Tanco is considering a plan to use potassium chloride in place of common salt. Research has shown that Tanco could reprocess the by-product of potassium chloride use to yield a crop fertilizer, leaving a relatively small volume of waste for disposal.\n\nIn determining the impact on company profits of using potassium chloride in place of common salt, it would be important for Tanco to research all of the following EXCEPT:\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Tanco is considering a plan to use potassium chloride in place of common salt. The answer choices consist of questions that may or may not be important to research in determining the impact of that plan on Tanco's profits. Before diving into the answer choices, let's make sure we understand the plan and the rationale behind it:\n\n impact to Tanco's profits should be eliminated.\n\nWe know that Tanco's plan will allow the company to avoid the increased costs of salt water disposal. But will this plan increase costs in other ways? What if the amount of potassium chloride needed to preserve some quantity of hides costs much more than the amount of common salt needed to preserve the same quantity of hides?\n\nSure, Tanco will save on disposal costs, but the company will have to spend more on potassium chloride than it spent on common salt. If that cost increase is large enough, then the plan to switch to potassium chloride could actually have a negative effect on profits. Tanco would certainly want to research these amounts in determining the impact of the plan on company profits, so eliminate (A).\n\nIf some or all of the equipment involved when using common salt is NOT suitable when using potassium chloride, then Tanco may have to upgrade or replace that equipment. If these equipment changes are small, they may not be very costly. But Tanco might have to invest a substantial amount of money in equipment modifications before switching to potassium chloride. Depending on the amounts, this could significantly affect Tanco's profits.\n\nIn determine the impact of the plan on company profits, Tanco would want to research equipment compatibility. Eliminate (B).\n\nEven if the potassium chloride by-products are reprocessed to yield a crop fertilizer, Tanco will have to dispose of a relatively small quantity of waste. The quantity of waste may be small, but how expensive is it to dispose of that waste? What if the environmental regulations on this waste make its disposal significantly expensive? How would those disposal costs compare to the increased salt water disposal costs?\n\nDepending on the exact amounts, disposal of the small quantity of potassium chloride waste might be more expensive than the disposal of salt water, even after the new regulations are implemented. Tanco would certainly want to determine whether the company will face other regulations if the plan is implemented. This question would be important to research in determining the effect of the plan on Tanco's profits. Eliminate (C).\n\nEven if using potassium chloride is the cheaper option, will it affect the characteristics of the leather? What if using potassium chloride results in leather that is significantly different than the leather produced using common salt? Such differences, if any, could affect the demand for and/or price of Tanco's products. This could certainly affect Tanco's profits. Choice (D) presents a question that is important to research, so eliminate (D).\n\nAs long as both substances have the same  on the hides, the  by which they operate are not important. Perhaps the chemical properties that make potassium chloride an effective means for preserving animal hides are significantly different than the chemical properties that make common salt an effective means for preserving animal hides.\n\nSo what? Are hides preserved using potassium chloride different than hides preserved using common salt? Knowing that the  are different doesn't tell us whether the hides themselves will be different. Researching this question alone would not reveal potential differences in the hides or the resulting leathers.\n\nSimply knowing whether the chemical properties are the same or different would not tell us anything about profits. Thus, this research is not important in determining the impact of the plan on company profits.\n\nThat makes (E) our answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "The advanced technology of ski boots and bindings has brought a dramatic drop in the incidence of injuries that occur on the slopes of ski resorts: from 9 injuries per 1,000 skiers in 1950 to 3 in 1980. As a result, the remainder of ski-related injuries, which includes all injuries occurring on the premises of a ski resort but not on the slopes, rose from 10 percent of all ski-related injuries in 1950 to 25 percent in 1980. The incidence of these injuries, including accidents such as falling down steps, increases with the amount of alcohol consumed per skier.\n\nWhich one of the following can be properly inferred from the passage?\n\n",

        "explanation": "You can look at the argument in math terms.\n\n1950: 9 injuries on the slopes per 1000 skiers --&gt; Off slopes injuries are 10% of injuries. So, 9 on slopes injuries per 1000 must be 90% of injuries.\n\nTotal injuries per 1000 1950: 9 on slopes +  1 off slopes = 10 total\n\n1980: 3 injuries on the slopes per 1000 skiers --&gt; Off slopes injuries are 25% of injuries. So, 3 on slopes injuries per 1000 must be 75% of injuries.\n\nTotal injures per 1000 1980: 3 on slopes + 1 off slopes = 4 total\n\nNow let's look at the answer choices.\n\n(A) As the number of ski injuries that occur on the\nslopes decreases, the number of injuries that\noccur on the premises of ski resorts increases.\n\nNo. The off slope number per 1000 did not change.\n\n(B) The amount of alcohol consumed per skier\nincreased between 1950 and 1980.\n\nThere is no reason to believe this, especially as off slope injuries did not increase.\n\n(C) The technology of ski boots and bindings\naffects the incidence of each type of\nski-related injury.\n\nActually, off slope injuries did not change even after the introduction of the ski boots and bindings.\n\n(D) If the technology of ski boots and bindings\ncontinues to advance, the incidence of\nski-related injuries will continue to decline.\n\nThis seems likely, but the prompt does not actually indicate that this is the case. The prompt discusses what happened in the past without saying much that indicates what would happen in the future should the technology continue to advance.\n\n(E) Injuries that occurred on the slopes of ski\nresorts made up a smaller percentage of\nski-related injuries in 1980 than in 1950.\n\nThis  is true.

        "question": "Inflation has traditionally been viewed as a negative cycle for an economy, whereas deflation has been seen as a time for the economy to return to healthier price levels. In recent years, though, economists have begun to view low inflationary development over time as healthy for the modern economy, due to the fact that inflation signals growth of money supply and increased prices. These increased prices become increased value for businesses and eventually trickle down to consumers as employees. Although prices are actually higher, consumers have more liquidity and thus spend more, helping to balance the economy. Many economists believe that inflation can sustain an economy that is struggling with recession.\n\nWhich of the following may be inferred from statements made in the passage above?\n\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Question provides the student with information concerning the economic arguments about inflation and deflation. The author of the passage begins by noting that inflation is traditionally viewed in a negative light, with deflation traditionally seen as a period for the economy to find stable price levels. In recent years, however, economists have begun to argue in favor of inflation for economic growth, because inflation accompanies the growth of money supply. Prices might be higher than is considered normal or healthy for the economy, but higher prices usually signal higher incomes and more liquidity among consumers. The passage concludes with the comment that economists believe inflation to be valuable during a period of economic recession. The question then asks the student to select an answer choice that may be inferred from statements made in the passage.\n\n\n\nE Answer choice (E) offers the unstated contrast to inflation by indicating why deflation would not help an economy: prices might be lower, but so are incomes, leaving consumers with less liquidity and less opportunity to return money into the economy through spending. Answer choice (E) is correct.\n\n\n\nA Far from recommending or valuing severe inflation, economists—according to the passage—recommend “low inflationary levels.” Answer choice (A) contradicts statements that are made in the passage, so it is clearly not inferred. Answer choice (A), therefore, is incorrect.\n\nB The author of the passage suggests that inflation has “traditionally” been viewed in the exact reverse of how they are viewed today. As a result, it cannot be inferred from the passage that inflation has historically been viewed as healthy, with deflation viewed as unhealthy. Answer choice (B) cannot be correct.\n\nC Answer choice (C) offers information that might be perfectly true, but there is nothing in the passage to suggest it. As a result, answer choice (C) must be eliminated as irrelevant.\n\nD Answer choice (D) is tempting, because the author does specifically mention the value of “low inflationary levels.” This would suggest that higher rates of inflation would not necessarily benefit an economy. At the same time, there is not enough information in the passage to suggest that higher rates of inflation can have devastating effects on a healthy economy. This assumes more than the passage implies, so answer choice (D) is incorrect.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

Because, The argument is supporting the fact that genetic material is the key in shaping child's personality but not environment. This is rightly paralleled in option D which states sowing tomatoes gives tomatoes but not other things. Initially Even I was inclined towards C because, The child remains as the child only that his/her thoughts or personality is under debate. It is our general outside knowledge makes us think in a manner that environment would have an impact on child and hence sowing tomatoes gives tomatoes but not necessarily good ones due to of environmental impact. But as per the argument there is little or no environmental impact so sowing tomatoes gives tomatoes (the exact ones) but not daffodils or cucumber.\n\nAlso, more importantly the argument never mentions that the child becomes bad due to environment and upbringing. But option C does say that the tomatoes may end up as bad tomatoes. This is not correct hence D answer. \n\nPlease feel free to correct me. I am open to change and learn.\nthanks\nBalaji",

        "question": "It is characteristic of great artists generally, and of great writers in particular, to have a discerning view of the basic social and political arrangements of the society in which they live. Therefore, the greater a writer one is, the more astute one will be in perceiving the basic social and political arrangements of one’s society.\n\nWhich one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the reasoning above?\n\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "This is going to be easy, because it’s a fairly common flaw on the LSAT. It’s basically, “All A are B, so if you’re  A, then you’re  B.” That’s not always true. Example: “Drinking whiskey is fun, so the more whiskey you drink, the more fun you’ll have”? Well, for me that’s true until about Jameson number five or maybe six. At a certain point the fun-meter actually starts to go the other way. Jameson number 15, for example, would certainly not be as fun as Jameson number three; actually, it would be zero fun. Another example: “Some rain is good for a golf course, so more rain is always more good for a golf course.” Nah. It’s true that without some water, all golf courses would dry up and disappear. But with too much water, the golf course would be submerged, and would also disappear. Okay, I think you get the point.\n\nThe question tells us there’s a flaw, which we are fortunate enough to have already identified. : If you haven’t already identified the flaw in the argument, when the question tells you there is a flaw, you damn well better figure out what that flaw is before looking at the answer choices. The answer choices are going to describe a wide range of flaws, and you need to be really sure what you’re looking for if you want to have any chance.\n\nA) No, this would be the answer if the argument had said, “The cast of  is, overall, good at dancing. Therefore Ron Artest / Metta World Peace and Martina Navratilova (the first cast members to be kicked off in two recent seasons) are also good at dancing.” That’s certainly flawed, but it’s not the same flaw.\n\nB) This is closer, but this isn’t what we’re looking for. This would be the answer if the argument had said, “Because my grandma won a $400 jackpot at a quarter slot machine last year, I am guaranteed to win money this weekend in Vegas.” Very stupid, but we’re looking for the same stupid.\n\nC) Nah. The argument makes no claim about what other insights these artists and writers may or may not have.\n\nD) No, the argument doesn’t make any claim about what kind of discerning criticisms non-great people may or may not be able to make.\n\nE) Yeah, exactly. Jameson is fun, but more Jameson isn’t always more fun.\n\nOur answer is E.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

The reviewer clearly conflates the author's bad personality traits with the author's ability or credibility when it comes to scientific research. It sounds easy to say this now, but POE helped get me here as well.\n\n(B) taking it for granted that an investigator is unlikely to report findings that are contrary to the interests of those funding the investigation\nThis one was fairly tempting. But if we really read the passage closely we see that the REVIEWER does not take it for granted. The AUTHOR may take it for granted, but the REVIEWER does not.\n\n(C) dismissing a scientific theory by giving a biased account of it\nNope. Be careful not to conflate the bias the REVIEWER may have for the AUTHOR with the AUTHOR'S THEORY. The reviewer is not saying that there is something wrong with the theory proposed. The reviewer is saying that the author's bad traits make whatever has been theorized something that should be dismissed simply on that basis.\n\n(D) presenting as facts several assertions about the book under review that are based only on strong conviction and would be impossible for others to verify\nThe only assertion was the TROUBLING aspect, but that could easily be verified by reading it, I daresay.

        "question": "Researcher: Each subject in this experiment owns one car, and was asked to estimate what proportion of all automobiles registered in the nation are the same make as the subject’s car. The estimate of nearly every subject has been significantly higher than the actual national statistic for the make of that subject’s car. I hypothesize that certain makes of car are more common in some regions of the nation than in other regions; obviously, that would lead many people to overestimate how common their make of car is nationally. That is precisely the result found in this experiment, so certain makes of car must indeed be more common in some areas of the nation than in others.\n\nWhich one of the following most accurately expresses a reasoning flaw in the researcher’s argument?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In this research experiment, each subject was asked to estimate what portion of the nationwide population drove the same type of car as the subject, and everyone overestimated this percentage. The researcher hypothesizes that this tendency to overestimate is a result of the fact that car trends may be regional, with certain models more common in particular areas, leading the people in those areas to believe that their cars are equally well-represented nationally. The results of the research are consistent with this hypothesis, so the researcher concludes that certain models are indeed more common in certain areas:\n\n There is no need to estimate the likelihood that the population is well informed about such statistics—the point is that everyone overestimated how common their cars were. Since this choice does not describe a reasoning flaw, it can be safely ruled out.\n\n This is the correct answer choice. The researcher points to the fact that the regional auto over-representation hypothesis is supported by the experiment’s results, but appears to believe that the hypothesis is confirmed by those results.\n\n The argument doesn’t need to account for the subjects’ coming from various places—the flaw regards the author’s hypothesis, and presumption that this theory is accurate.\n\n Since the premises that are presented in the stimulus do not contradict one another, this cannot describe the reasoning flaw from the stimulus.\n\n No statistical generalization is assigned in this stimulus: the researcher discusses one study and presents a hypothesis which attempts to explain people’s tendency to overestimate how common their cars are nationally.\n\n­",

The corresponding increase for Parkdale is only 10 percent. It is clear, therefore, that a resident of Meadowbrook is now significantly more likely to become a victim of violent crime than a resident of Parkdale is.\n\nThe argument given is most vulnerable to the objection that it fails to consider\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of the argument is the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for the conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nOne thing we might notice about the argument is that the evidence is about PERCENTAGE INCREASES in numbers of crimes per 1,000 residents whereas the conclusion is about THE CURRENT LIKELIHOOD of a resident becoming a victim of crime.\n\nIn other words, as we'll discuss in more detail in going through the choices, the argument has made a leap from increases over time to actual crime rates at the present time without effectively connecting the two.\n\n\n\nThe question is a Logical Flaw question, and the correct answer will highlight something such that the argument is flawed because it fails to consider that.\n\n\n\nNotice that the evidence in the argument is about \"violent crimes per 1000 residents\" and that the conclusion is about how \"likely\" a resident is to become a victim of crime.\n\nNeither of those statistics is affected by how much the populations grew. After all, regardless of how much the population of a city grows, that fact does not change the number of crimes per resident since crimes per 1000 residents is a ratio of total crimes to total residents. That ratio would not be expected to have changed just because the population of a city changed. Rather, as the number of residents grew, we'd expect the number of crimes to grow at about the same rate.\n\nIn other words, the TOTAL number of crimes in a city would logically be affected by population growth, but the crimes PER RESIDENT would not.\n\nSo, that the argument does not consider the rates of population growth is not a flaw because the argument works without consideration of those rates.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe argument is about actual numbers of crimes per 1000 residents and the likelihood that a person will be a victim of crime. Those statistic remain what they are regardless of how concerned people are about becoming victims of crime. In other words, even if residents of Meadowbrook are not as concerned as residents of Parkdale about crime, there still has been a larger increase in crime in Meadowbrook than in Parkdale.\n\nSo, the argument is not flawed because it doesn't consider how concerned people are about becoming victims of crime since it's not about concerns. It's about what's actually occurring.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe argument is not about the effects of crime or how serious crimes are. It's solely about crimes per thousand residents and the likelihood that a resident will be a victim of crime.\n\nSo, while it doesn't consider seriousness of crimes, that it doesn't is not a flaw.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nAs we discussed in considering choice (A), the evidence in the argument is about \"violent crimes per 1000 residents\" and the conclusion is about how \"likely\" a resident is to become a victim of crime.\n\nNeither of those statistics is affected by the size of the population. In other words, regardless of what the populations of the two cities are, the numbers of crimes \"per 1000 residents\" and the likelihood of a resident becoming a victim of crime have the same meaning. After all, regardless of how large the population of a city is, that fact does not change the number of crimes per resident or the likelihood of a resident being a victim of a crime, which are ratios of numbers of crimes to total population.\n\nSo, the argument doesn't have to consider the relative sizes of the populations of the two municipalities because the relative sizes don't affect what the argument is about.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is interesting.\n\nAs discussed in the analysis of the argument above, the argument makes a leap from evidence about percentage increases in crimes per 1000 residents over time to a conclusion about crime rates at the present time. The issue with using that evidence to support that conclusion is that there are no reference points to connect the two.\n\nAfter all, information on a percentage increase in crime in a city doesn't tell us the city's current crime rate. After all, a city that started off with a low crime rate could have a huge percentage increase in crime and still have a low crime rate, and a city that started off with a high crime rate could have a small percentage increase in crime and still have a much higher crime rate than another city.\n\nSo, in this case, the fact that Meadowbrook experienced a much greater percentage increase in crime than Parkdale doesn't necessarily mean that Meadowbrook currently has a higher crime rate than Parkdale. After all, Meadowbrook's crime rate could have started at a much lower base.\n\nIn general, to effectively support a conclusion about current crime rates using information about percentage increases, an argument needs information about the starting rates, which this argument does not have.\n\nSo, this argument is flawed because it does not consider the starting violent crime rates in the two municipalities four years ago.\n\nKeep.\n\n E­",

Scientists believe that huge numbers of plant and animal diseases have developed and been eradicated naturally over time. This ongoing emergence and disappearance of diseases is ignored by those who blame the widespread incidence of cancer entirely upon man’s alteration of naturally occurring substances to, for instance, produce bigger and better food sources. For example, some claim that the use of hormones to increase meat production heightens the risk of cancer in people who eat meat. People who hold this view need to accept the fact that even if cancer was not such a prevalent disease, another disease would have arisen naturally to take its place.\n\nWhich one of the following identifies a flaw in the passage’s reasoning?\n\n",

However, the implementation of scientific advances might impact the “ongoing emergence and disappearance of diseases.” Therefore, the flaw in the writer’s reasoning stems from his refusal to consider the possible impact of man’s alteration of naturally occurring substances upon the emergence of new diseases. \n\nSelection (A) is tempting. However, the author disagrees with those who argue that man’s conduct is “entirely” responsible for the high incidence of cancer. Thus, he implies that man’s actions might have some role in the prevalence of cancer.

The LSAT test is designed so that outside knowledge is not needed to answer the questions. Rather, the questions should be answered solely on the basis of what is stated or implied in the passage. Inadvertently, the LSAT authors might include a question that can be more readily answered with outside knowledge, but they make every effort to avoid that situation. With respect to (C), whether or not diseases have been discovered or not is irrelevant to the passage, and (D) is similarly irrelevant.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

The government ousted the corporation in name, but the management team and workforce, most of whom were foreign, remained to operate the facility and were given a large pay increase.

In the 10 years since the refuge was established, only 20 planes have been damaged in collisions with birds, and no passenger has been injured as a result of such a collision. The wildlife refuge therefore poses no safety risk.\n\nPilot: You neglect to mention that 17 of those 20 collisions occurred within the past 2 years, and that the number of birds in the refuge is rapidly increasing. As the number of collisions between birds and airplanes increases, so does the likelihood that at least one such collision will result in passenger injuries.\n\nThe pilot counters the conservationist by\n\n",

With that in mind, let’s consider the answer choices.\n\nThe conservationist states that a mere 20 collisions have taken place over the course of 10 years. But the pilot notes that the conservationist “ that 17 of those 20 collisions occurred within the past 2 years.” By failing to add crucial context, the conservationist has, according to the pilot, made airplane/bird collisions seem to be less frequent, and thus less problematic, than they really have been in the past two years. In other words, the conservationist’s depiction of the frequency of collisions between birds and airplanes seems to be misleading. So, let’s keep (A).\n\nThe pilot simply does not discuss the conservationist’s motives in reaching the conclusion that the wildlife refuge poses no safety risk. Eliminate (B).\n\nAt first glance, (C) seems plausible. The pilot does argue that the likelihood of a collision resulting in passenger injuries will increase over time. The problem is that (C) implies that dangerous situations, , ALWAYS become more dangerous over time. But that’s not what the pilot is arguing. \n\nThe pilot believes that this particular dangerous situation is likely to become more dangerous. The pilot supports that by noting that the frequency of airplane/bird collisions has increased recently, and it is likely to continue to increase. But this is not the result of the passage of time. It’s the result of the rapidly increasing number of birds in the refuge. In other words, if there were fewer birds today than there were in the past, then we would be inclined to believe that the danger today is less than it was in the past. So, not ALL dangerous situations INEVITABLY become more dangerous . Eliminate (C).\n\nThe conservationist’s argument is not based on a moral principle. The conservationist’s argument is based on the belief that, because the refuge has posed no safety risk in the past, it will continue to pose no safety risk in the future. Eliminate (D).\n\nThe pilot does not dispute the accuracy of the figures cited by the conservationist. In fact, the pilot seems to confirm the accuracy of the figure given by the conservationist that only 20 planes have been damaged in collisions with birds over the past 10 years. The pilot simply adds a caveat that 17 of those 20 collisions took place in the past two years.

Consumers are increasingly demanding nonpolluting energy, and energy companies are increasingly supplying it.\n\nTherese: I'm not sure we should do what you suggest. As demand for nonpolluting energy increases relative to supply, its price will increase, and then the more polluting energy will cost relatively less. Demand for the cheaper, dirtier energy forms will then increase, as will the stock values of the companies that produce them.\n\nTherese responds to Mansour's proposal by doing which of the following?\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "- Mansour makes a suggestion to somebody that they both should plan to change some of their investments. What change? From coal companies to less polluting energy companies.\n\n - In these lines, Mansour supports his suggestion. Why should they invest in less polluting energy companies? Since consumers are increasingly demanding nonpolluting energy, and energy companies are increasingly supplying it. (Since there’s more demand for less polluting energy companies, these companies will probably grow well and thus seem to be a better investment than coal companies, which pollute more)\n\n - Therese casts a doubt on Mansour’s suggestion.\n\n - In this statement, Therese explains the reason for her doubt. She says that as demand for nonpolluting energy increases even more than the supply, the price of this energy will go up (basic demand and supply). In such a case, nonpolluting energy will be relatively more expensive than the more polluting energy.\n\n - The above will lead to an increased demand for the more polluting energies. The increased demand will increase the stock prices of these companies. (And thus, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to abandon coal companies and buy less polluting energy companies instead)\n\nWe have to find a way in which Therese responds to Mansour’s suggestion. From our understanding above, we can see that Therese points out market dynamics (more demand -&gt; higher prices -&gt; customers switch back to coal companies) overlooked by Mansour and thereby casts a doubt on his suggestion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

This is the author's main objection.

So (A) is gone.\n\nBy saying that postal workers \"are often said to be more productive if more letters are delivered per postal worker\", the author gives an example of using output (number of letters delivered) to measure productivity. The author does NOT imply that this measure of productivity is flawed because delivery of letters is not the primary activity of the postal service. Instead, the author implies that this measure is flawed because it doesn't address the quality of the services (i.e., lost or delayed letters). So we can cross out (B), too.\n\nThe author's objection relates to how productivity is , not to whether it is ascribed to categories of workers or to individuals. Although the author does  a category of workers (postal workers), the author doesn't address whether productivity should be measured at the level of groups or individuals. We can eliminate (C).\n\nRemember that the author's main doubt is whether productivity can be measured solely by output per worker (i.e., number of letters delivered per postal worker, in this example). In the example about postal workers, the output per worker is increased, but quality of service declines. So in the passage, the author is clearly doubting whether quality can be appropriately ignored in computing productivity. So (D) looks good!\n\nThe author does not imply that the number of letters is not  to measuring the productivity of postal workers; rather, the author objects to whether productivity can be measured by output . The author implies that other factors, such as quality of services rendered, should be considered  output when measuring productivity. So we can get rid of (E).\n\nAnd that leaves us with (D).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

Other such questions are the bold-face type of question, the evaluate the argument type of question etc. \n\nThis question asks us to determine the relationship between Elizabeth’s argument and Catherine’s argument.  Elizabeth’s argument deals with the fact that thousands of college graduates face unemployment because the training given to them by college is not complete. She suggests that the government should deal with this problem by providing hands-on industrial training, which will make up for the gap left by the college education.\n\nCatherine’s argument deals with Elizabeth’s plan. But, she only states that there will be certain college graduates who still will not be able to get jobs even if the training programmes are effective. By addressing only a group that will not benefit from the training, Catherine leaves out the group of people that may actually benefit from the training. By doing so, Catherine contradicts Elizabeth’s plan, but only deals with the possibility that it may not help one group.\n\nOption B states that Catherine believes that Elizabeth’s plans are based on an impractical concern. What Catherine says is that the ‘plan’ will not work practically, not that the ‘concerns’ that the plan is based on are impractical. So, Option B is wrong. \n\nOption C is wrong because it states that Catherine assumes that Elizabeth’s plan will not have ‘any’ positive impact, implying that nothing good will come out of it. However, there is no such suggestion in her argument. The use of the word ‘any’ makes it a rather extreme option.\n\nOption E states that Catherine brings out a flaw in Elizabeth’s argument. However, Catherine only points out that a certain group ay not benefit from the plan. That is not a flaw in the plan itself. \n\nWe are left with Options A and D.

        "question": "Traditional regional performing arts groups across the country provide an important service to small communities. Most of these groups focus on the performance of time-honored material and offer people within the communities an opportunity to experience excellent traditional performances without having to travel far. Unfortunately, federal funding tends to support avant-garde groups whose focus is largely on progressive material. Although these groups are unquestionably an essential facet of the performing arts, they do not generally draw as wide of audiences and thus are receiving an undue amount of federal funding for the service that they provide to a community and the return on the federal investment. Those responsible for providing federal grants to performing arts groups should reconsider the allotment of funding in order to favor traditional performing arts groups with respect to their service to a community.\n\nThe argument in the passage above proceeds by\n\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "In this question, the passage presents an argument about the need for better standards to determine federal funding for the performing arts, and the student is asked to identify the way in which the argument proceeds. In order to do so, the student should consider the argument step by step: (1) a general claim about the importance of performing arts groups who offer traditional repertoire, (2) a claim about the value to small communities of such groups, including their close proximity to small communities, (3) the comment that federal funding favors groups with progressive material, even though these groups draw smaller audiences than traditional groups, and (4) the claim that federal funding should allot more money to traditional groups. With these steps of the argument in mind, the student can consider the answer choices.\n\n\n\nA Based on the outline presented above, it is clear that answer choice (A) is the one that best describes the pattern of reasoning in the passage. The author of the passage begins by presenting a general statement about the importance of traditional groups, develops this view with supporting details, and then concludes with a suggestion for future action. Therefore, answer choice (A) is the correct answer.\n\n\n\nB Although the author of the passage raises awareness about a problem, there is no indication that the author is demanding attention at any time, and based on the opening of the passage it is clear that the author does not begin the argument with a demand; rather, the author begins by presenting a general claim. Answer choice (B) is incorrect.\n\nC Far from undermining the opposition, the author points out that avant-garde groups contribute something very important to the performing arts. And although the author does raise questions about the way federal funding is allotted to the performing arts, the author does not draw a conclusion from this but rather offers a suggestion for an alternative action. Therefore, answer choice (C) may be eliminated.\n\nD The author does not begin the passage with a call to action. Instead, the author opens with a general remark about the importance of traditional performing arts groups. What is more, the author does not at any point discuss problems with those who oppose the argument in the passage, so answer choice (D) is clearly incorrect.\n\nE The author does publicize a concern within the passage and encourage action to be taken, but the author does not discuss alternatives for addressing the concern. Nor does this answer choice reflect the progression of the author’s argument within the passage. Answer choice (E) is incorrect.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "Light is registered in the retina when photons hit molecules of the pigment rhodopsin and change the molecules’ shape. Even when they have not been struck by photons of light, rhodopsin molecules sometimes change shape because of normal molecular motion, thereby introducing error into the visual system. The amount of this molecular motion is directly proportional to the temperature of the retina.\n\n\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "(A) The temperature of an animal’s retina depends on the amount of light the retina is absorbing.\n(B) The visual systems of animals whose body temperature matches that of their surroundings are more error-prone in hot surroundings than in cold ones.\n(C) As the temperature of the retina rises, rhodopsin molecules react more slowly to being struck by photons.\n(D) Rhodopsin molecules are more sensitive to photons in animals whose retinas have large surface areas than in animals whose retinas have small surface areas.\n(E) Molecules of rhodopsin are the only pigment molecules that occur naturally in the retina.\n\nSource :Lsat\n\nThe correct answer choice is (B).\n\nPremise: Light is registered in the retina when photons hit rhodopsin molecules and the molecules change shape?\nPremise: Due to normal molecular motion, rhodopsin molecules sometimes change shape without having been hit by light. This change causes errors in the visual system.\nPremise: The amount of molecular motion is directly proportional to the temperature of the retina.\n\nAnswer Choice A: The stimulus does not indicate that the temperature of the retina depends on the amount of light. It could easily be affected by other factors, such as body temperature. About 15% of test takers fell prey to this answer.\n\nAnswer Choice B: This is the correct answer and just over 40% of test takers correctly choose this answer. To prove this answer, you must link together several pieces of information. First, the last sentence of the stimulus shows that the amount of rhodopsin molecular motion is directly proportional to the temperature of the retina, and the second sentence of the stimulus shows that this motion causes visual body temperature (remember, the retina is a body part) to the temperature of the surroundings and then rightly notes that hot surroundings would cause more visual errors than cold surroundings if body temperature matched those surroundings.\n\nAnswer Choice C: This was the most popular incorrect answer, and just under a quarter of test takers fell for this answer. The answer is wrong because we do not know that temperature causes the rhodopsin to react more slowly. Higher retinal temperature causes the rhodopsin molecules to change shape, but no mention is made of reaction time. This answer falls under the \"New information\" category.\n\nAnswer Choice D: Another New Information answer choice. Similar to answer choice (C), this answer fails the Fact Test because no information is given about the surface area of the retina. Answer choices (C) and (D) are great examples of how an answer can contain information unmentioned by the stimulus. These answers are somewhat attractive because there is nothing actively wrong about them and thus they could be true. To avoid them, always keep in mind that your goal is to find the answer that must occur based on the information in the stimulus.\n\nAnswer Choice E: While the stimulus focuses on rhodopsin, no indication is given that rhodopsin is the only naturally occurring pigment molecule-there could be others.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

That angle can be kept fairly stable only by the gravitational influence of Earth’s large, nearby Moon. Without such a stable and moderate axis tilt, a planet’s climate is too extreme and unstable to support life. Mars, for example, has only very small moons, tilts at wildly fluctuating angles, and cannot support life. \n\nIf the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true on the basis of them? \n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "To attack this problem effectively, you must recognize the conditional indictors in each sentence: “only” in the second sentence and “without” in the third sentence. Do not be intimidated by the science topic! As we will see, if you can understand the conditional form of the stimulus, the topic is of little concern. The two sentences produce the following conditional relationships, which can be linked: AS = angle stable, GI = gravitational influence of Earth’s large, nearby Moon, PCE = planet’s climate too extreme and unstable to support life. \n\nSentence 2: AS—&gt;GI. \nSentence 3: ~PCE—&gt;AS. Chain: ~PCE—&gt;AS—&gt;GI. Again, consider the answers that are most likely to appear in a problem like this: either the chain inference ~PCE—&gt;GI, or the contrapositive of that chain inference, ~GI—&gt;PCE. \n\nAnswer choice (A): This incorrect answer is the Mistaken Reversal of the chain inference. The diagram for this answer choice would be as follows, with the sub-M indicating Mars: GI—&gt;~PCE. \n\n As expected, this is the contrapositive of the chain inference. \n\nAnswer choice (C): This incorrect answer is the Mistaken Reversal of the third sentence, and is diagrammed as follows: AS—&gt;~PCE. \n\nAnswer choice (D): This answer discusses issues that were not raised in the stimulus, and is thus incorrect. \n\nAnswer choice (E): The stimulus indicates that Earth’s large Moon has been necessary for the stable angle of Earth’s tilt, and this stable angle has been necessary for a climate that can support life. Mars, with many small moons, tilts at fluctuating angles and cannot support life. The key difference is that Earth’s Moon is large, and that creates a greater gravitational influence. It is possible therefore, that a planet with more than one moon could have a stable angle as long as at least one of the moons was of sufficient size (in Mars’ case, the stimulus indicates each moon is small). Thus, it is possible that a planet can have more than one moon and support life. This scenario is contrary to the answer choice, and thus this answer is incorrect.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

Any question that asks you about \"what must be true\" is essentially asking you to make an inference on the basis of the data provided, and we can classify all such questions in the same category.\n\nThe challenge with GMAT inference questions is that the answer we pick cannot be false in any circumstances. This means that the correct answer should ALWAYS be true with NO additional assumptions.\n\n - All we know is that the prices are inflated. We have ZERO information on whether only the wealthy can afford these drugs or not. What is also important to note is that you should never bring external knowledge into play, so whatever you may know or think about how healthcare currently functions in the US, there is no information  that backs up anything about affordability on the consumer side. Hence, this answer is \n\n - The info we've been given is that pharma companies subsidise orphan drugs by charging more for popular ones, and that this is how they maintain profits. If the regulation comes into play, they will not be able to make the same profit UNLESS there's another source of income. This is exactly what the option states and most importantly, .

Remember that when you're trying to eliminate an option in an inference question, all you have to do is show that there is even a . It is possible, based on the data we've been given that NO patients currently already request generics (since we have no information on this front,  is possible). Hence, we can eliminate this option. \n\n - This is a bit of a trap answer. At first glance, it at least deals with profits and the production of drugs. However, if the cost of producing drugs are lowered, it would necessarily lower the selling price, since the new rule states that the selling price MUST be based on the cost price. Hence, it is unclear that profits would increase. In fact, saying the profits will increase for sure is already a pretty extreme answer. Remember that the option you pick  in any condition. This option is therefore .\n\n - This is a super unrelated claim, we have no info on charitable donations, and cannot say anything about whether they are declining or not. Hence, there's no way to say that this option is definitively true. \n\n - Matoo from CrackVerbal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

In cases where you are searching for a conclusion, it helps to apply a conclusion term in front of it, like \"therefore\" (whereas for premise searches, put words in front like \"because\").\n\nA) The high courts have [...] treated moral beliefs [...] as a ground for making exception in the application of law, [THEREFORE] The manner in which laws are applied sometimes takes into account the beliefs of the people governed by those laws. \n\nThis makes sense so I keep it as a possible answer.\n\nB) The high courts have [...] treated moral beliefs [...] as a ground for making exception in the application of law, [THEREFORE] The law has as one of its functions the ordering of society but is devoid of moral aims. \n\nThis doesn't make sense because the premise says that courts DO consider morality in legal decisions. Eliminate B.\n\nC) The high courts have [...] treated moral beliefs [...] as a ground for making exception in the application of law, [THEREFORE] Actions based on religious belief or on moral conviction tend to receive the protection of the highest courts. \n\nThis makes sense, so I keep it as a possible answer.\n\nD) The high courts have [...] treated moral beliefs [...] as a ground for making exception in the application of law, [THEREFORE] The way a society is ordered by law should not reflect any moral convictions about the way society ought to be ordered. \n\nThis is contradicting the premise, so I eliminate D.\n\nE) The high courts have [...] treated moral beliefs [...] as a ground for making exception in the application of law, [THEREFORE] The best way to promote cooperation among a society's institutions, organizations, and citizenry is to institute order in that society by means of law.\n\nThis conclusion does not support the premise.

The author states that unemployment has risen less during her time in office than it did during her predecessor's time, and therefore her economic policies must be more effective.

So I am going into the answer choices looking for an answer choice that rules out some other possible reasons.\n\nAnswer choice A weakens the argument if anything.  If the population dropped significantly, then maybe it was easier for people to find jobs (which could have stayed more constant), regardless of economic policy.\n\nAnswer choice B is out of scope, as it is focused on the national economy, and also would weaken the argument if anything by showing generally better economic conditions during the time that she was in office over her predecessor's time.\n\nAnswer choice C is correct because it rules out a couple of other possible factors.  If you negate this (Key socioeconomic variables...are NOT comparable for each administration) and plug it back into the argument, you can see that the argument disintegrates - which is what you are looking for on assumption critical reasoning questions.\n\nAnswer choice D would strengthen the argument, but it isn't a necessary assumption. There could have been many smaller changes that the administration made, or blunders that it avoided, rather than key policy changes that it made.\n\nAnswer choice E may also strengthen the argument (if we assume that she was responsible for implementing those tax incentives), but it is not a required assumption because she could have done something else with economic policy that reduced the growth in unemployment and the argument would still hold.\n\nI hope this helps!",

        "question": "Many gardeners believe that the variety of clematis vine that is most popular among gardeners in North America is . This belief is apparently correct since, of the one million clematis plants sold per year by the largest clematis nursery in North America, ten percent are .\n\nWhich of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of this passage is that the gardener's belief--that jackmanii is the most popular variety of clematis vine among gardeners in North America (NA)--is apparently correct. The word \"apparently\" is very important here. The conclusion would be substantially different if we were to replace \"apparently\" with \"definitely\".\n\nMore on that in a moment... but first, why does the author conclude that the belief is  correct?\n\n be in fact be the most popular variety at the nursery.\n\nWould that  that jackmanii is the most popular variety in NA? Not necessarily. But if jackmanii is #1 at the largest nursery, that's certainly EVIDENCE that jackmanii is #1 in NA. Again, we are trying to conclude that the belief is APPARENTLY correct, not that the believe is DEFINITELY correct. As long as we have evidence that jackmanii is the most popular variety among NA gardeners, we're in good shape.\n\nWith that in mind, let's look at the answer choices:\n\nIf the nursery sells 10 varieties or fewer, then there would HAVE to be another variety that accounts for more than 10% of the one million plants sold at the nursery. If that were true, then jackmanii could not be the most popular variety at the nursery. Thus, we would  have evidence that jackmanii is #1 in NA. Without choice (A), the argument falls apart.\n\nNow, does choice (A) PROVE that jackmanii is #1 at the nursery? Not at all... even with 20 varieties, there could be another type that accounts for more than 10% of the million. That, of course, would ruin the argument.\n\nEven if choice (A) is true, the argument may or may not be valid, but that's okay. In other words, choice (A) doesn't PROVE that the author's reasoning is sound. But without choice (A), the author's argument  be valid. This is a  assumption, so keep (A).\n\nThe nursery could sell many other types of plants. As long as jackmanii is the most popularity variety of  plant sold at the nursery, then the author's reasoning holds up. This is not a required assumption, so eliminate (B).\n \nIf a  portion of jackmanii sales were to gardeners outside of NA, then we might have a problem. That might suggest that jackmanii's popularity at the nursery is NOT a good indicator of jackmanii's popularity among NA gardeners.\n\nChoice (C) only says that SOME of the jackmanii are sold to gardeners outside of NA. In that case, the jackmanii sales at the nursery are probably a good indicator of its popularity among NA gardeners.\n\nDoes that make (C) a REQUIRED assumption? If (C) were not true and the nursery ONLY sold jackmanii to gardeners within NA, then that would probably further strengthen the argument. That would give us even more reason to believe that the sales at the nursery are a good indicator of NA popularity. Choice (C) is not a required assumption, so eliminate (C).\n\n \nIt doesn't matter whether clematis is a popular plant in general. The belief is that jackmanii is the most popular variety OF clematis. Even if only a tiny fraction of NA gardeners grow clematis, jackmanii could still be the most popular variety among those gardeners who DO grow clematis. Eliminate (D).\n\nThis is admittedly a little bit tempting: sure, it would strengthen the argument. But this isn't a strengthen question: we need to know whether this is NECESSARY to draw the conclusion. \n\nAnd it isn't necessary: even if (E) is NOT true -- for example, if jackmanii accounts for less than 10% of clematis plants at a few nurseries -- it's still possible that jackmanii is the most popular. And since (E) isn't necessary, it's not the correct answer.\n\n(A) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

In order to reduce the amount of residual ash Shelbyville generates this year to half of last year's total, the city has revamped its collection program. This year city services will separate for recycling enough refuse to reduce the number of truckloads of refuse to be incinerated to half of last year's number.\n\nWhich of the following is required for the revamped collection program to achieve its aim?\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The aim of the revamped collection program is \"to reduce the amount of residual ash Shelbyville generates this year to half of last year's total.\" Let's examine the given information:\n\n, ALL refuse collected by city services was incinerated. Make sure you notice key modifiers such as \"all\" and think about how they impact the meaning. In this case, we know that 100% of the collected refuse was incinerated., city services will reduce the number of truckloads of refuse to be incinerated to HALF of last year's number. This information is given, so we don't need to worry about how much trash Shelbyville is going to produce, the proportion that will be recycled, etc. Regardless of those details, we can safely assume that city services will have HALF as many truckloads of refuse to send to the incinerator this year. We just don't know whether reducing the number of truckloads by half will also reduce the ash by half.Let's say (A) doesn't happen, and some material that COULD have been separated for recycling gets incinerated instead. This would be unfortunate, but it would not change the GIVEN information. We already know that city services WILL reduce the number of truckloads to half of last year's level. That reduction in truckloads will occur even if city services sends some recyclable material to the incinerator. Thus, (A) is not required and can be eliminated.\n\nWe are not concerned with the COSTS of the program. We are trying to determine whether reducing the number of truckloads by half will also reduce the amount of ash by half. Choice (B) is irrelevant and can be eliminated.\n\nAgain, we don't care how much refuse is collected or what proportion of that refuse is recyclable. We already know that city services will cut the number of truckloads in half. This will happen regardless of whether this year's refuse contains a larger proportion of recyclable materials. Choice (C) is also irrelevant and can be eliminated.\n\nWe know that city services will send half as many truckloads to the incinerator, but will that reduce the amount of ash by half? If the refuse incinerated this year generates MORE residual ash per truckload than did the refuse incinerated last year, then reducing the truckloads by half will NOT reduce the amount of ash by half.\n\nIn other words, if each truckload generates, on average, more ash this year than it did last year, then we need to reduce the number of truckloads by MORE than half in order to cut the amount of ash in half. Choice (D) IS required if the program is going to achieve its goal, so hang on to this one.\n\nOnce again, we don't care how much refuse is collected. Regardless, the number of trucks will be cut in half compared to last year. Choice (E) can be eliminated.\n\n(D) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Hey All,\n\nSo Vann's explanation here was fantastic, but I thought I'd throw in my two cents. We don't get a lot of \"Explain the Discrepancy\" questions here on the forums, so I have to take one when I can get it. I just wanted to remind you all that there is still a process, which I'd like to model for you.\n\nInstead of a typical CR outline (conclusions/premises/assumptions), discrepancy questions revolve around one question. Just make sure you REWORD/PARAPHRASE that question, and actually write it down. If you have confidence in it, you'll see how all the wrong answer choices fail to resolve your issue.\n\nIn this case, the discrepancy is fairly straightforward: How can the government pay a bunch of money to farms and yet not lose money?\n\nIt should be obvious that the correct answer better describe how the government is MAKING money in some other way:\n\n(A) If prices were allowed to remain low, the farms would be operating at a loss, causing the government to lose tax revenue on farm profits.\nANSWER: This answer choice is a bit tricky, because instead of describing DIRECTLY how the government might gain money, it explains how the payments to farms will keep it from losing EVEN MORE money.\n\n(B) Wheat production in several countries declined the year that the compensation program went into effect in Canada.\nPROBLEM: See, without a rephrase of the question, this is the kind of weird indirect answer choice that you'd end up staring at for 30 seconds. But it doesn't remotely relate to the government making money, so we can cross it off.\n\n(C) The first year that the compensation program was in effect, wheat acreage in Canada was 5% below its level in the base year for the program.\nPROBLEM: Again, a bit of statistics to make you think you're missing something. But the amount of acreage is irrelevant, because we need to get more money to the government somehow.\n\n(D) The specified maximum per farm meant that for very large wheat farms the compensation was less per acre for those acres than they were for smaller farms.\nPROBLEM: This sucks for the farms, but still doesn't tell us anything about our discrepancy.\n\n(E) Farmers who wished to qualify for compensation program could not use the land not harvested for wheat to grow another crop.\nPROBLEM: Again, sucks to be a farmer.\n\nThe process is great because it helps you center your attention. This question is about THE GOVERNMENT, and answer choice A is the only one that even mentions the government by name!\n\nHope that helps!\n\n-t",

However, those people who regularly drink two or three alcoholic beverages a day and thereby exceed the caloric intake necessary to maintain their weight do not in general gain weight.\n\nWhich one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?\n\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The paradox in this problem is that alcohol drinkers who surpass the threshold for calorie intake should gain weight, but they do not. Most people, upon reading the stimulus, prephrase an answer involving exercise or some other way to work off the expected weight gain. Unfortunately, a perfect match to this prephrase does not appear, and instead students are faced with a tricky answer that preys upon this general idea while at the same time it fails to meet the circumstances in the stimulus.\n\nAnswer choice (A): Read closely! The stimulus specifies that people who regularly drink two or three alcoholic beverages a day thereby exceed the necessary caloric intake. This answer, which discusses individuals who avoid exceeding the caloric intake necessary, therefore addresses a different group of people from that in the stimulus. Since information about a different group of people does not explain the situation, this answer is incorrect.\n\nThis answer is attractive because it uses the idea of getting rid of or avoiding calories, but it violates one of the precepts of the stimulus. Remember, you must look very closely at the circumstances in the stimulus and make sure that the answer you select matches those circumstances.\n\n If the excess calories are dissipated as heat, then there would be no weight gain. Hence, alcohol drinkers can consume excess calories and still not gain weight.\n\nSome students object to this answer because the situation seems unrealistic. Can heat dissipation actually work off dozens if not hundreds of calories? According to the question stem, yes. Remember, the question stem tells you that each answer choice should be taken as true. Since this answer choice clearly states that the excess calories tend to be dissipated, you must accept that as true and then analyze what effect that would have.\n\nAnswer choice (C): The stimulus discusses “people who regularly drink two or three alcoholic beverages a day and thereby exceed the caloric intake necessary.” This answer choice addresses a different group of people than those discussed in the stimulus.\n\nAnswer choice (D): The first flaw in this answer is that it simply states that individuals consuming alcohol do not gain weight but it offers no explanation for why these people have no weight gain. The second flaw in the problem is that it addresses the wrong group of people. The stimulus discusses people who drink two or three alcoholic beverages a day; this answer addresses people who drink more than three alcoholic beverages a day.\n\nAnswer choice (E): Again, this answer discusses a different group of people than those in the stimulus. The stimulus discusses people who exceed the necessary caloric intake; this answer addresses people who do not meet the necessary caloric intake.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "Economist: The law of demand predicts that as the price of a good goes down, demand for that good will increase, and vice-versa. In a recent experiment, economists gave coupons for rice to families in a province of China, where it is a staple food. The coupons effectively lowered the cost of rice, and should have led the families to buy more of it. Instead, households given the coupons purchased less rice than a control group who did not receive coupons.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most helps to explain the amount of rice purchased by families who received coupons?\n",

        "question": "Recently, scientists determined that great white sharks can live over 70 years, much longer than had been previously thought. They made the discovery by examining the layers of different colors that accumulated on the shark's teeth over the years. In the 1950s, atomic bomb testing produced unusually large amounts of carbon-14, which fell from the atmosphere into the ocean and accumulated as a distinctive layer on the shark's teeth corresponding to a known period in time. Perplexingly, even though great white sharks live longer than had been expected, some parties maintain that based on the new findings, the great white sharks must be protected from overfishing.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, best resolves the discrepancy identified above?\n\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Explanation from GMAT FREE, the source \n\nReading the question: We have a long prompt and a short stem, so we check the stem. It says \"resolve a discrepancy.\" That's the same as \"explain.\" As discussed in Osprey Prey and Caller Complaints, since we are explaining, we should identify the two parts of the so-called \"discrepancy.\" The correct answer will need to address both parts, without contradicting any of the facts given. \n\nCreating a filter: \"Perplexingly\" is an important word, because it allows us to parse the prompt into two parts. The second, shorter part is that sharks must be protected from overfishing. Why is that perplexing? Because of whatever the main point of the first part is: sharks live longer than expected. We'll look for something that connects logically to both parts: 1) sharks live longer than expected, and 2) they must be protected. \n\nApplying the filter: (A) doesn't connect to the sharks' age. Choice (B) just restates part of the prompt. Choice (C) just restates the other part of the prompt. Choice (D) doesn't connect to either portion of the discrepancy. Choice (E) touches on both parts: it says that if sharks are older than we thought, there are fewer of them than we thought. That's a good reason to protect them from overfishing. \n\nLogical proof: A logical proof is not always possible on \"explain\" questions, but we can use the negation test to confirm (E), in this case. Suppose that sharks reproduced more quickly than had previously been assumed: that would lessen the need to protect sharks. Since the negation would add to the mystery and contradict the opinion of \"some parties,\" we have confirmation the non-negated (E) would, indeed, resolve the mystery.

Erosive forces wear mountains down but are still the strongest on the highest mountains.\nWe would expect from the answer choices something that explains why the higher the mountains are, the stronger the erosion forces.\n\n\n(A) Patterns of extreme wind and precipitation often result from the dramatic differences in elevation commonly found in the highest mountain ranges.\n Extreme wind/rain are found normally in highest mountain ranges. Cool! This hits the point! This is pretty much what we wanted to hear. This provides a reason.\nSo lets keep  for now and keep looking in the other answer choices to make sure there is not a better answer choice.\n\n(B) The highest mountain ranges have less erosion-reducing vegetation near their peaks than do other mountain ranges.\n This answer talks about vegetation that reduce erosion. The plants do not reduce  themselves. It may be a tempting answer choice if you miss that detail.\nBut apart from that, this fact presented by  does still not explain why there is so much more wind/rain at the highest mountains than on some lower mountains.\n\n\n(C) Some lower mountain ranges are formed by a different collision process, whereby one tectonic plate simply slides beneath another of lesser density.\n That lower mountains are formed by a different process has nothing to do with the problem of having higher erosion forces on higher mountains. Remember, the flaw was only about Point 2).? Point 1) was about how mountains are formed, but there never was a flaw about that. So this answer choice has a different focus and is not relevant to us.\n\n\n(D) The amount of precipitation that a given region of the earth receives may vary considerably over the lifetime of an average mountain range.\n And why does this explain why we have strong erosion forces on the highest mountains? This does not explain why explicitly high mountains should have explicitly much more erosion forces than other mountains.\n\n\n(E) The thickening of the earth’s crust associated with the formation of the highest mountain ranges tends to cause the thickened portion of the crust to sink over time.\n We only want an explanation why we have such strong erosion forces on the highest mountains. Whether the crust portion of mountains sinks or rises over time, or wanders off to completely different locations is not of relevance to explaining the flaw discussed.\n\n\n\nOnly One choice is left, so mark  then.\nHope this helps!",

This is like saying FDA approved for use by expecting mothers an obstetric medicine that failed because some ingredient of the medicine had some  poisonous element.  In a national program, the side effects are more important than the desired effect. Yet again, no farm program will release a plan direct from the lab without testing in the farms. \n\nSecondly the argument does not say anything about barley yield. It simply talks about the farmer’s economic lot after using the kit. What if the barley did yield well but the prices fell? \n\nIf there were a choice: the price of barley plummeted in those years  due to unprecedented dumping from the neighboring countries, which had introduced similar programs.  \nIMHO that is the kind of paradox that would be convincing. \n\n(I have gone through the video explanation)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n!\n-bb",

        "explanation": "Which of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the paradox outlined above?\n\n(A) Brand names are taken by consumers as a guarantee of getting a product as good as the best rival\nproducts.\n(B) Consumers recognize that the quality of products sold under invariant brand names can drift over time.\n(C) In many acquisitions of one corporation by another, the acquiring corporation is interested more in\nacquiring the right to use certain brand names than in acquiring existing production facilities.\n(D) In the days when special quality advantages were easier to obtain than they are now, it was also easier to\nget new brand names established.\n(E) The advertising of a company’s brand-name products is at times transferred to a new advertising agency,\nespecially when sales are declining.\n\nI answered D but it is incorrect- D states that it was easier to get brand names established. What it means is that today is it difficult to establish a brand name. I believe that explains the paradox as even though good quality products can be made by any one it is difficult to create a brand name and for those who have created it- they have a marketing edge and that is what the question is asking.Can someone tell me whats wrong with this logic \n\nBefore answering this \"how\", please understand that we are thinking of this advantage in terms of the company because the last line clearly says that \"brand names are a bigger marketing advantage than ever.\". This marketing advantage cannot be used for the consumers, it is for the company who owns the product.\n\nSo, how does a branded product has an advantage over a non-branded product? There could be only two factors: higher price or higher sales. In other words, the product could generate greater profits per unit or sell more units. In either way, the company would be at an advantage.\n\nIn our current case, it is given that the product doesn't sell at a higher price but still it given a marketing advantage. So, now the other way of giving advantage is through increased sales.\n\nSo, if an option statement suggests that people will buy branded products more than unbranded products, that would resolve the paradox - \n\n\n\n\n\nNow, as we go through the options, we see that option A provides a very valid reason to suggest that branded products will sell more than unbranded products. Why? Because at the same price, you are getting a guarantee of quality if you buy a branded product.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct choice.\n\nHowever, let's also look at option D.\n\nThis basically says that brand names are difficult to get established now. But it doesn't say that how these brand names are a marketing advantage even though they don't allow us to charge higher. Here, some of us have used our common knowledge that brand names are an advantage in all situations. But we can't use this common knowledge here.\n\nHope this helps  Get 25 AI powered videos | 400 practice questions | 8 free webinars How a personalized study plan can save you 60+ hours M7 admits | INSEAD admits | ISB admits [40+ case studies]\n\nLearn why e-GMAT has 10X more 700+ verified scores than other GMATClub partners –",

        "question": "In Kantovia, physicians’ income comes from insurance companies, which require physicians to document their decisions in treating patients and to justify deviations from the companies’ treatment guidelines. Ten years ago physicians were allowed more discretion. Most physicians believe that the companies’ requirements now prevent them from spending enough time with patients. Yet the average amount of time a patient spends with a physician during an office visit has actually increased somewhat over the last ten years.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy between physicians’ perceptions and the change in the actual time spent?\n\n",

        "explanation": "This concerns the time patients spend  to see physicians, not the amount of time they spend  physicians. Since it doesn't affect the amount of time physicians actually spend with patients, we can discard (A).\n\nIf physicians had a wider range of diagnosis and treatments options to consider today, they may need more time with patients than they did in the past. This could explain why physicians today feel they get too little time with patients DESPITE having more time than they did in the past. Let's hold on to (B).\n\nThe fact that physicians are in group practices wouldn't affect the amount of time they'd spend with patients in any clear way.

        "question": "A five-year clinical trial was conducted to study the effectiveness of hair loss prevention treatments on two different groups of men, all of whom were 25 years old when the trial began. Before the trial began, none of the men had shown signs of hair loss, which is widely believed to be caused primarily by genetic factors. The treatment given to Group A was a pill taken daily for the duration of the trial, and the treatment given to Group B was a topical scalp cream used once daily for the duration of the trial. By the end of the five-year trial, 50% of the members of Group A had experienced some hair loss while only 25% of the members of Group B had experienced some hair loss. Despite these results, the treatment used on Group A was considered significantly more effective in preventing hair loss than the treatment used on Group B.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most helps to explain the apparent discrepancy?\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "The first step is to identify the discrepancy, using the author's own words as much as possible: \"Despite these results (that, by the end of the five-year trial, 50% of the members of Group A had experienced some hair loss while only 25% of the members of Group B had experienced some hair loss), the treatment used on Group A was considered  more effective in preventing hair loss than the treatment used on Group B.\"\n\nWhat else do we know...\n\n of the treatments. So if a larger percentage of Group A experienced some hair loss, why was the treatment used on Group A considered  more effective?\n\nWe need a statement that helps explain this apparent discrepancy:\n\nChoice A is tempting because it certainly makes the treatment used on Group B seem slightly less effective than we would conclude based solely on the information in the passage. But is this strong enough to explain why the treatment used on Group was considered  more effective, even though the percentage of Group A that experienced hair loss was double that of Group B? This doesn't seem like a strong enough answer, but I wouldn't cross it off just yet.\n\nThe treatment used by members of Group A might be significantly more convenient and easier to use than the treatment used by members of Group B, but these characteristics have nothing to do with the  of the two treatments. We need something that explains why the treatment used on Group A was considered more significantly more , not more convenient. Eliminate (B).\n\nAs with the last choice, choice (C) addresses a characteristic--cost--that has nothing to do with the effectiveness of the two treatments. We need a statement that addresses effectiveness, not affordability. Eliminate (C).\n\nWe are told that \"hair loss is widely believed to be caused primarily by genetic factors.\" Thus, if Group A consists of men with a family history of hair loss, most of those men, without treatment, may have been likely to experience hair loss. Similarly, most of the men in Group B may have been likely to avoid hair loss, even without treatment. In fact, if statement (D) is true, it is possible that the treatment used on Group B had no effect at all. Perhaps, due to genetic factors, only 25% of Group B's members would have experienced hair loss even without treatment.\n\nRemember, we are looking for an answer that  helps to explain the apparent discrepancy. The statement in choice (D) certainly explains why the treatment used on Group B is less effective than it seems based on the facts given in the passage. This statement also explains why the treatment used on Group A was more effective than it seems based on the facts given in the passage. Thus, even though we can't know for sure what percentage of men from each group would have experienced hair loss without treatment, choice (D) helps explain the discrepancy more than choice (A).\n\nThe amount and degree of the side effects have no impact on the  of the treatments. One treatment could be considered significantly more effective, even if its side effects are much worse. Thus, choice (E) does not help explain the discrepancy and can be eliminated.\n\nChoice (D) is the only explanation that would explain why the treatment used on Group A might be considered  more effective. So choice (D) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "Since the introduction of the Impanian National Health Scheme, Impanians (or their private insurance companies) have had to pay only for the more unusual and sophisticated medical procedures. When the scheme was introduced, it was hoped that private insurance to pay for these procedures would be available at modest cost, since the insurers would no longer be paying for the bulk of health care costs, as they had done previously. Paradoxically, however, the cost of private health insurance did not decrease but has instead increased dramatically in the years since the scheme’s introduction.\n\nWhich one of the following, if true, does most to explain the apparently paradoxical outcome?\n\n",

        "question": "Large inequalities in wealth always threaten the viability of true democracy, since wealth is the basis of political power, and true democracy depends on the equal distribution of political power among all citizens.\n\nThe reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely parallels the reasoning in the argument above?\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "This one showed up for me on Google. I noticed that no one actually took the time to explain their answer, which leads me to conclude that most people achieved the correct answer either by process of elimination or by guessing. Neither strategy is particularly helpful for learning how to answer these questions, so I will endeavor to explain systematically how to solve these questions.\n\nI realize this is a really long post, but it's important that everyone understands the systematic process for solving these questions. It takes time initially to symbolically represent every argument, but with time and practice your speed will improve, and in some cases you will be able to rule out options without even diagramming them.\n\nThe first step is to establish whether we are dealing with an argument or merely a set of facts. This is in fact an argument, which means that it has a conclusion. Isolating the conclusion is the first step to properly understanding the argument. \n\n\n\nThe conclusion is in fact the first statement: [b]Large inequalities in wealth always threaten the viability of true democracy, and .\n\nHaving isolated our conclusion and supporting premises, we can now turn the admittedly poorly written english sentences into symbolic logic. The purpose of doing this is to clearly isolate the argument structure, so that we can compare the structure to the structure in the supposed parallel arguments in the answer choices.\n\nThe first sentence states that large inequalities in wealth threaten the validity of true democracy. A simple way to think about this statement is that in a true democracy (TD), equality of wealth (EW) is :\n\nTD --&gt; EW\n~EW --&gt; ~TD\n\nHere we are applying two basic principles of formal logic: sufficient and necessary, and the contrapositive rule (later, we'll apply a third: transposition). In the interest of brevity I won't explain sufficient and necessary except by way of a simple example. All lawyers have graduated law school. Lawyers is sufficient. Law school is necessary. As such, it is only valid to say that if you did not graduate law school you are not a lawyer. That is,\n\nSufficient --&gt; Necessary:    Lawyer --&gt; Graduate Law School\nContrapositive:     ~Graduate Law School --&gt; ~Lawyer\n\nIt is NOT correct to say that all graduates of law school are lawyers, nor that those who are not lawyers did not graduate law school. It is perfectly possible and in fact often the case that law graduates obtain careers in other fields. The contrapositive above is the only valid argument we can form from the original sufficient-necessary statement.\n\nLet's return to the question. We've established that TD --&gt; EW, and, therefore, ~EW --&gt; ~TD. Remember, this is the conclusion of the argument. Now lets examine the premises to determine the validity of the argument, and dissect its structure.\n\n\"wealth is the basis of political power\"\n\nIf wealth is the basis of political power, that means that wealth is  for political power. Since we know our conclusion is talking specifically about equality of wealth, we'll be consistent and say that :\n\nPP --&gt; EW\ncontrapositive: ~EW --&gt; ~PP\n\n\"true democracy depends on the equal distribution of political power among all citizens\"\n\nThe word depends informs us that equal distribution of political power (PP) is necessary. That means that true democracy (TD) is sufficient. \n\n(If you're having trouble with sufficient and necessary think about to our lawyer-law school example. This premise simply says that if you have a true democracy then you have equal distribution of political power. If equally distributed political power does not exist, then you don't have a true democracy.)\n\nTD --&gt; PP\n~PP --&gt; ~TD\n\nGreat. We've now symbolically established our conclusion and our supporting premises. Let's put them together so we can get a better sense of what we're dealing with.\n\nP1: PP --&gt; EW\n       ~EW --&gt; ~PP\n\nP2: TD --&gt; PP\n       ~PP --&gt; ~TD\n\nC: TD --&gt; EW\n    ~EW --&gt; ~TD\n\nIf you're keen to these sorts of questions, you'll notice that a pattern exists here. If the argument is valid, the premises will necessarily inform the conclusion. And that's the case with this question. Using transposition (all dogs are cats, all cats are frogs, therefore all dogs are frogs), we can combine the premises in order to assert the conclusion:\n\nTD --&gt; PP and PP --&gt; EW\n\nPut it together:\n\nTD --&gt; PP --&gt; EW\n\nUsing the rules of transposition (see the dog example above), we can conclude that . \n\nAnd that is the argument's original conclusion, which we identified above. That means the argument is valid. More specifically, we have a valid transposition argument. (Note: in this example, we didn't need to rely on the contrapositives, but often we do need the contrapositives to properly transpose, which is why we've taken that step).\n\nGreat, we've symbolically established the argument. Now let's move on to the answer choices and evaluate them in the same manner:\n\n\n\nP: CC &amp; TI --&gt; U\n    ~U --&gt; ~ CC or TI\n\nP: U --&gt; IE\n    ~IE --&gt; ~U\n\nC: CC &amp; TI ---&gt; DC\n     ~DC--&gt; CC &amp; TI\n\nWe can see that not only does A not show the same argument structure, but it's not even a valid argument. The answer is NOT A.\n\n\n\n\nP: B --&gt; L \n~L --&gt; ~B\n\nP: B --&gt; $\n~$ --&gt; ~B\n\nC: BS --&gt; ~M\n     M --&gt; ~BS\n\nB doesn't show the right argument structure. The premises also don't necessarily lead to the conclusion, so it isn't a valid argument. B is out.\n\n\n\n\nP: HF --&gt; HA\n~ HA --&gt; ~HF\n\nP: SF --&gt; ~HA\n    HA --&gt; ~SF\n\nC: SFNP --&gt; D\n     ~D --&gt; ~SFNP\n\nEven if we take there to be an implied premise that historical accuracy is difficult to achieve (these questions don't typically rely on an implied premise; the lack of the premise invalidates the argument), the argument structure simply doesn't match our original argument. Delete C. \n\n\n\n\nP: H some A\n  (cannot apply the contrapositive here)\n\nP: H ??? MF\n\nC: MF --&gt; H\n     ~H --&gt; ~MF\n\nClearly this argument structure is not analogous to our original question. That it is difficult to predict the effect of honesty on maintaining friendship reveals that we cannot properly transpose this argument. That means that it absolutely cannot be the correct answer.\n\nBy process of elimination we've determined that E is the correct answer, but let's break down the argument structure to verify that it is the case.\n\n\n\n\nNote: in some cases, it's easier to symbolically represent the argument by starting with the negation. That's what we'll do in this case. Then we can use the contrapositive rule to get our positive statement, correctly showing our sufficient and necessary conditions.\n\nThe conclusion basically states: no leisure time --&gt; no good health\n\nC: ~LT --&gt; ~GH\n      GH --&gt; LT\n\nNow, let's evaluate the premises:\n\nP: GH --&gt; RME\n    ~RME --&gt; ~GH\n\nP: RME --&gt; LT\n    ~LT --&gt; ~RME\n\nNotice that we can transpose these premises. GH --&gt; RME  and RME --&gt; LT. Therefore, GH --&gt; RME --&gt; LT. Finally, we can conclude that GH --&gt; LT. Unsurprisingly, this is the conclusion of the argument. We have therefore identified the only other valid argument among the answer choices, and like the original argument it was identified via transposition. \n\nIn order to solve these questions effectively, you need to be able to easily identify sufficient and necessary conditions. You need to understand the contrapositive rule and its nuances (MOST negates to SOME, for example). And, you need to be able to take descriptive phrases and break them down into simple acronyms. It takes a lot of effort to work through these questions, but unlike most question types you can almost certainly find the correct answer. Only the correct answer will show the same argument structure, and in most cases the other choices will be invalid (assuming the original argument was valid).\n\nGood luck!",

Because, The argument is supporting the fact that genetic material is the key in shaping child's personality but not environment. This is rightly paralleled in option D which states sowing tomatoes gives tomatoes but not other things. Initially Even I was inclined towards C because, The child remains as the child only that his/her thoughts or personality is under debate. It is our general outside knowledge makes us think in a manner that environment would have an impact on child and hence sowing tomatoes gives tomatoes but not necessarily good ones due to of environmental impact. But as per the argument there is little or no environmental impact so sowing tomatoes gives tomatoes (the exact ones) but not daffodils or cucumber.\n\nAlso, more importantly the argument never mentions that the child becomes bad due to environment and upbringing. But option C does say that the tomatoes may end up as bad tomatoes. This is not correct hence D answer. \n\nPlease feel free to correct me. I am open to change and learn.\nthanks\nBalaji",

So choice (C) effectively tells us that SuperOXY can't be ingested in the only way that leads to more oxygen absorption.\n\nThis has nothing at all to do with  of oxygen that can be absorbed through blood. But it doesn't have to, because we're asked if choice (C)  as the bolded statement. We're not adding (C) to the passage. Instead, we're replacing the bolded statement with (C).

Choice (D) says absolutely nothing about SuperOXY, and the argument doesn't care at all about any of these other potential factors.

Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) increase the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke, but we can tentatively conclude that high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) help prevent coronary heart disease and stroke. First, aerobic exercise increases one’s level of HDLs. Second, HDL levels are higher in women than in men. And both aerobic exercise and being female are positively correlated with lower risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.\n\nEach of the following, if true, strengthens the argument EXCEPT:\n\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "I have big problems with the logic here. (I bet you’re shocked.) The conclusion of the argument is, “We can tentatively conclude that HDLs help prevent coronary heart disease and stroke.” But the evidence is shaky. Let’s start with the link between HDLs and aerobic exercise. The logic goes like, “Aerobic exercise increases your HDLs, and aerobic exercise is correlated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke, therefore HDLs help prevent heart disease and stroke.” Huh? What if\n\nI had said this instead? “Aerobic exercise increases your sexiness, and aerobic exercise is correlated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke, therefore sexiness helps prevent heart disease and stroke.” Does that make any sense? Nope, and it’s the same exact logic used by the author.\n\nThe same problem exists with the “being female” rationale for why HDLs supposedly lower your risk of heart disease and stroke. All we have here is correlation, and you must always remember that correlation does not prove causation.\n\nThe question asks us to identify the single correct answer that does  strengthen the argument. So there are four potential strengtheners and one correct answer that is either irrelevant or actually weakens the argument. Let’s see.\n\nA) This would make the argument start to make some sense, because it proposes a mechanism whereby HDLs could help reduce heart disease and stroke. We’re told that cholesterol is a known factor in coronary heart disease and stroke, so if HDLs help get rid of cholesterol then that’s a good thing. This is causation, rather than mere correlation. This is a strengthener, so it is not our answer.\n\nB) This is an additional factor showing a  between HDLs and heart disease and stroke. We already had two factors indicating the correlation, and I’m not sure a third really helps all that much. A fairly common incorrect answer on a Strengthen question is one that repeats a premise that’s already in evidence. Since we already knew the variables were correlated, I don’t see how this is a strengthener—which would make it a good answer for this “strengthen… EXCEPT” question. I’m hoping C through E are all strengtheners like A so that I can confidently choose B.\n\nC) Oh man. This seems completely irrelevant to me. At least B provided an additional correlative factor. What does “removed from the bloodstream” have to do with anything? I don’t even see that concept in the argument anywhere. I like this answer best so far, because it’s the  irrelevant. At least B would reinforce the argument. This one doesn’t do ****.\n\nD) This says that HDLs help lower your health risks, which is a  relationship. This is a good strengthener, so it’s not our answer.\n\nE) This is another data point in favor of the correlation between HDLs and good health. It’s not a wonderful strengthener, but at least it’s relevant.\n\nC, being entirely irrelevant, must be our answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

When subjects would taste one, the normal one, it would fit their expectations.  When they would taste the other, with white vinegar, presumably this one would be different from what they expected.   So we know they would be trying to identify which one was different, and it's reasonable to assume that when they tasted the one with white vinegar, they had an experience different from what they were expecting.  Granting all that, how do we conclude they they would .\"  In other words, just because they were looking for something different, and just because they had an experience that did not meet their expectations, I see no basis for concluding with any confidence that they liked the altered soda or, even more so, that they would have preferred.

We want to know what happens when the competitive position improves. \n\n(B) For certain segments of the population of consumers, higher-priced brands of some product lines are preferred to the lower-priced brands.\n\nDoes not strengthen our conclusion. We want to say that reducing price makes people prefer the product.\n\n(C) Competing products often try to appeal to different segments of the population of consumers.\n\nThen the concept of competitive position does not make sense. This option doesn't work with our argument.\n\n(D) The competitive position of a product can be affected by such factors as advertising and brand loyalty.\n\nWhat other factors can impact competitive position is irrelevant.\n\n(E) Consumers’ perceptions of the quality of a product are based on the actual quality of the product.\n\nCorrect. We are claiming that improving quality or reducing price will make people prefer the product. But what if consumer's perception of quality is based on price? What if lowering price makes people think that the product's quality is lower? For people to prefer the product, their perception of quality should be based on actual quality. Price is not ambiguous anyway. Then the increase in value will be perceived by the customers and they will prefer it.\n\nAnswer (E)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Premises:\nFor over two centuries, no one had been able to make D blades - blades with a specific surface pattern.\nA sword maker may just have rediscovered how to make D blades now.\nHe used iron with trace impurities (that precisely matched those present in the iron used in historic D blades) and an intricate process.\n\nHypothesis: Trace impurities in the iron are essential for the production of Damascus blades\n\nWe want to strengthen it. We need to show that D Blades are always made with iron with impurities. You cannot make a D Blade without the trace impurities.\n\nA) There are surface features of every Damascus blade-including the blades produced by the contemporary sword maker-that are unique to that blade.\nThis says that every D blade is unique. It doesn't say that trace impurities are essential.\n\nB) The iron with which the contemporary sword maker made Damascus blades came from a source of iron that was unknown two centuries ago.\nThe iron source used today was unknown to D Blade makers. This information is apparent from the argument too. The contemporary sword maker had to add trace impurities to make the iron same as that used in making D blades. It doesn't tell us that the impurities are essential and that the sword maker could not have made the D-Blade without adding the impurities.\n\nC) Almost all the tools used by the contemporary sword maker were updated versions of tools that were used by sword makers over two centuries ago.\n\nThe contemporary sword maker used updated tools. No reference to what kind of iron was used.\n\nD) Production of Damascus blades by sword makers of the past ceased abruptly after those sword makers' original source of iron became exhausted.\n\nThis tells you that when the original source of iron was exhausted, production of D-blades stopped. This means that the sword makers could not make D-Blades with some other source of iron. So then, the iron from the original source was special and was required to make the D-blades. This gives more credibility to the theory that the trace impurities found in that iron were essential to making D-blades. Hence this option is correct. \n\nE) Although Damascus blades were renowned for maintaining a sharp edge, the blade made by the contemporary sword maker suggests that they may have maintained their edge less well than blades made using what is now the standard process for making blades.\n\nComparison of D blade edge with edges of modern blades is out of scope.  \n\nAnswer (D)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "Budget constraints have made police officials consider reassigning a considerable number of officers from traffic enforcement to work on higher-priority, serious crimes. Reducing traffic enforcement for this reason would be counterproductive, however, in light of the tendency of criminals to use cars when engaged in the commission of serious crimes. An officer stopping a car for a traffic violation can make a search that turns up evidence of serious crime.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument given?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Budget constraints have made police officials consider reassigning many officers from traffic enforcement to work on serious crimes. But criminals often drive when committing serious crimes, and police who stop cars for traffic violations can find evidence of those crimes.\n\n \n\nThe argument implicitly reasons that because officers working on traffic enforcement can turn up evidence of serious crimes by searching cars that commit traffic violations, reassigning those officers would hinder police efforts to prevent serious crime, even if the officers were reassigned to work directly on serious crime. The argument could be strengthened by information suggesting that traffic enforcement may increase the probability that evidence relating to serious crimes will be discovered.\n\n This suggests that people committing serious crimes often commit traffic violations as well, increasing the likelihood that traffic enforcement officers will stop and search their cars and find evidence of those crimes.\nCriminals, while committing crimes, use cars.\nTraffic police can search when stopping  a car for a traffic violation. They might find evidence of serious crime during search.\n\nSo, do not reassign traffic policemen to serious crime. \n\nThe argument depends on traffic policemen being able to find serious crime while carrying out their duty as traffic policemen. The argument will not make a lot of sense if those carrying out serious crime do not break traffic rules. Then they will not be stopped and searched and hence the argument falls apart. \n\nWhat strengthens the argument? If something tells us that serious criminals often break traffic rules so they would be stopped for traffic offences. Then a search would be carried out and evidence found. \n\n(C) Those willing to break the law to commit serious crimes are often in committing such crimes unwilling to observe what they regard as the lesser constraints of traffic law.\nThis tells us that criminals often break traffic rules while carrying out crime. Then it makes it more likely that traffic police will stop them. \nSo the argument makes sense that we shouldn't reassign traffic policemen to serious crime. \n\n(A) An officer who stops a car containing evidence of the commission of a serious crime risks a violent confrontation, even if the vehicle was stopped only for a traffic violation.\n\nViolent confrontation is irrelevant.\n\n(B) When the public becomes aware that traffic enforcement has lessened, it typically becomes lax in obeying traffic rules.\n\nWe need a connect between traffic rule breaking and serious crime. \n\n(D) The offenders committing serious crimes who would be caught because of traffic violations are not the same group of individuals as those who would be caught if the arresting officers were reassigned from traffic enforcement.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether the same individuals will be caught. Some kind of serious criminals will be caught. \n\n(E) The great majority of persons who are stopped by officers for traffic violations are not guilty of any serious crimes.\n\nIrrelevant whether the majority of people stopped will be serious criminals or a small fraction.

        "question": "In response to viral infection, the immune systems of mice typically produce antibodies that destroy the virus by binding to proteins on its surface. Mice infected with a herpesvirus generally develop keratitis, a degenerative disease affecting part of the eye. Since proteins on the surface of cells in this part of the eye closely resemble those on the herpesvirus surface, scientists hypothesize that these cases of keratitis are caused by antibodies to herpesvirus.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, gives the greatest additional support to the scientist's hypothesis?\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "Start with the scientists' hypothesis. We are told that mice infected with a herpesvirus generally develop keratitis. The hypothesis is that \"these cases of keratitis (those in mice infected with herpesvirus) are caused by antibodies to herpesvirus\".\n\nNow that we've identified the hypothesis, let's look at how the scientists arrived at this hypothesis:\n\nIn order for this statement to support the hypothesis, we would need additional information. What happens when mice are infected with those other types of virus? Do the organs with similar proteins suffer any damage? If so, then the hypothesis would be supported. But without further evidence, choice (A) doesn't help. Eliminate (A).\n\nThese poor mice won't be able to fight the herpesvirus. If these mice also did NOT develop keratitis once infected with the herpesvirus, then we would have some solid support for the hypothesis. Unfortunately, we are not given such information.\n\nAll we know is that the mice who can't fight the herpesvirus contract the virus at about the same rate as other mice. We aren't interested in herpesvirus contraction rates. We are interested in the cause of the keratitis that generally develops in the infected mice. Eliminate (B).\n\nThis statement probably weakens the hypothesis. The scientists argue that the keratitis is caused by the antibodies. If these mice produce the same levels of antibodies and the antibodies cause the keratitis, then why wouldn't those mice also develop keratitis? This suggests that the antibodies  actually causing the keratitis.\n\nIf infected mice that do not develop keratitis did NOT produce as many antibodies as infected mice that do develop keratitis, then we would have support for the hypothesis. But this is not what statement (C) says, so eliminate (C).\n\nAh ha! This is what we were looking for in choice (B). The mice are unable to form antibodies in response to herpes infections. These poor mice cannot fight the virus, but they also do not develop keratitis. No antibodies, no keratitis. This certainly supports the scientists' hypothesis, so hang on to (D).\n\n \nNotice that the hypothesis specifically refers to \"THESE CASES of keratitis.\" Which cases? Those that develop in mice . So the scientists are not trying to explain causes of ALL cases of keratitis. Instead, they are only trying to explain the cases that develop in mice infected with herpesvirus.\n\nChoice (E) does suggest that there are other ways to develop keratitis (besides the way proposed by the scientists). If anything, this slightly weakens the hypothesis by implying that something else (besides the antibodies to herpesvirus) could be causing these cases of keratitis. At best, choice (E) is irrelevant. At worst, it weakens the hypothesis, so eliminate (E).\n\nChoice (D) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "The Euphronios krater, a sixth-century-B.C.E ceramic vase, was named for its painter, Euphronios. One side depicts the death of the mythic hero Sarpedon; the other, several anonymous Athenian youths arming themselves for battle. The youths lack Sarpedon's anatomical detail; their limited musculature is portrayed using faint, almost invisible lines and seems unfinished. Scholars have, however, dismissed the idea that Euphronios failed to complete the side depicting the Athenian youths.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, provides the strongest reason for the scholars position regarding the krater?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "The passage says that scholars have concluded basically the following:\n\nIt is not true that \"that Euphronios failed to complete the side depicting the Athenian youths.\"\n\nThe passage provides no support for that conclusion. Rather, it provides a reason to believe otherwise:\n\n\n\nThen, we are asked the following question:\n\n\n\nThe correct answer will provide support for the scholars' conclusion.\n\n\n\nThe fact that no other example of Euphronios's work have survived does not indicate anything about whether this particular work was completed.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice's stating that other kraters depict one scene on one side and a related scene on the other side is meant to tempt us to choose this choice because it could be perceived as somehow confirming an aspect of what the passage says about the Euphronios krater, which has one scene on one side and another scene on the other side.\n\nHowever, we need to confirm one specific idea, that it's not the case that Euphronios failed to complete the side depicting the Athenian youths.\n\nSo, since the information in this choice does not indicates anything about what constitutes a completed Krater, it does not do what we need.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nWe have to be careful not to run with this choice and create an unsupported story. For example, it would be easy to decide that the fact that Sarpedon was a stock figure used by sixth-century painters somehow explains why Sarpedon has anatomical detail that the youths don't have even though the vase was completed.\n\nThe truth is that the fact that Sarpedon was a stock figure used by sixth-century painters doesn't mean anything about whether Euphronios completed the side depicting the Athenian youths. All that information means is that Sarpedon was commonly used for the purpose of commenting on the concept of heroism. The fact that Sarpedon was commonly used doesn't indicate whether Euphronios considered the side depicting the youths complete.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is tricky to eliminate since we might decide that it means that the portrayal of the youths' musculature using faint, almost invisible lines is complete because it's an example of \"a new technique for depicting the body and its musculature.\"\n\nHowever, there's a key thing we need to notice, which is that the passage indicates that the musculature of both Sarpedon and the youths was depicted by Euphronios.\n\nSo, this \"new technique\" doesn't refer to how one or the other was depicted. It refers to how Euphronios depicted musculature in general, whether with \"Sarpedon's anatomical detail\" or \"using faint, almost invisible lines.\"\n\nThus, we have no reason to believe that this choice is about only the way the youths were depicted, and thus it doesn't indicate anything about whether the side with the depiction of the youths was completed.\n\nIf there were no better choice, we still might feel forced to decide that \"using faint, almost invisible lines\" is the \"new technique.\" However, we aren't forced to do so since (E) is a better choice.\n\nKeep just in case, but look for a better choice.\n\n\n\nThis choice indicates that \"minimal detail,\" such as \"faint, almost invisible lines,\" was commonly used when painting unheralded characters.\n\n\"Anonymous Athenian youths\" could be considered \"unheralded,\" meaning \"not previously known about or recognized.\" So, in \"using faint, almost invisible lines\" to depicts them, Euphronios would have been doing what many artists of the time did when they completed works.\n\nThus, what this choice says indicates that the work was completed, in a style common at the time.\n\nThe correct answer is (E).",

        "question": "Studies in restaurants show that the tips left by customers who pay their bill in cash tend to be larger when the bill is presented on a tray that bears a credit-card logo. Consumer psychologists hypothesize that simply seeing a credit-card logo makes many credit-card holders willing to spend more because it reminds them that their spending power exceeds the cash they have immediately available.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most strongly supports the psychologists’ interpretation of the studies? \n\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Got a PM to respond to this.\n\nI can see some great explanations above. Let me add my two cents to the discussion.\n\n\n\nMy very first observation of the given passage is that it is a causal argument. A causal argument is one in which we attribute the cause of some past event, say X, to some past event or a rule or something else, say Y. In other words, we say that X has caused Y or that X led to Y\n\nIn the given argument, we have\n\nY: the tips left by customers who pay their bill in cash tend to be larger when the bill is presented on a tray that bears a credit-card logo\nX: simply seeing a credit-card logo makes many credit-card holders willing to spend more because it reminds them that their spending power exceeds the cash they have immediately available\n\nAs we can see, even X has a causal structure and can be written as:\nCredit card reminds credit card holders that their spending power exceeds the cash they have immediately available ----&gt;&gt; (leads to) seeing a credit-card logo makes many credit-card holders willing to spend more ----&gt;&gt;&gt; the tips left by customers who pay their bill in cash is larger when the bill is presented on a tray that bears a credit-card logo\n\nIn essence, the hypothesis is that that credit card reminds people of their high spending power - this leads them to spend more - this leads in higher tips.\n\n\n\nThis is a strengthen question, as is clear from the question stem. We need to strengthen the psychologist's hypothesis. Since this is causal argument where we say that X is the reason for Y, we can strengthen it by saying that\n1. There is no Z which can be the reason for Y OR\n2. If we increase X while keeping everything else same, we'll increase Y - This could be indicated by saying that when customer see the credit card logo of the company they hold credit card of, they tip more than that when they see credit card logos of other companies.\n3. IF we remove X while keeping everything else same, we'll not have Y -  i.e. if the credit card logo doesn't remind people of their higher purchasing power, they would not tip higher.\n\n\n\nWith this pre-thinking, let's move over to the option statements:\n\n\n\nA.

        "question": "­Recent studies show that despite global efforts to reduce plastic waste by banning single-use plastics, the amount of plastic debris washing up on beaches has not decreased. Evidence of this is the consistent volume of plastic waste found during beach cleanups over the past year compared to the previous year. Nevertheless, environmental scientists have not concluded that these bans are ineffective.\n\nWhich of the following would, if true, provide the strongest reason for the scientists' reaction to the findings?\n",
        "answer": "Moderator Update: Answer choice D modified from \"this year\" to \"past twelve months\"",
        "explanation": "in prizes such as Courses, Tests, Private Tutoring, \n        \n        \n    \n\n­\n\n\n\nOption D provides the reason for why environmental scientists might hesitate to declare the bans on single-use plastics ineffective. If unusual ocean currents have affected the distribution of plastic debris, this would explain why there hasn’t been a noticeable decrease in waste on beaches year over year and thus why the scientist felt the ban was not ineffective.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the opposite answer choice from what we are looking for. This would make the paradox worse. Lots of plastics production has been reduced and yet we are seeing no results year over year. Bans are clearly not working unless there is an explanation but this choice does not explain why the same amount of plastics is washing up. Eliminate it.\n\n\n\nIf the amount of plastic waste produced annual varies, why has the same amount washing out on the beaches? Also, why would the scientist feel that the bans were not ineffective if the results were inconclusive? What would be the basiss of their judgement? This answer choice is a contender but it is incomplete and we should try to find a better one as this one leaves too many gaps.\n\n\n\nThis answer choice similar to A does not address why the same amount of plastics is washing up on the beaches, and why despite the same amount washing up, scientists felt their ban was effective.\n\n\n\nAs is, E) does not explain the paradox: 1) constant levels of waste washing up year over year and 2) why the scientists felt the ban was not ineffective.­\nIn the passage, scientists are measuring the ban effectiveness with the plastic debris washing up, and they are not seeing any difference year over year. E) does not explain why the amount of plastic washing up is constant despite the ban (source) which should have reduced the input.  Plastic clearly did not decompose (duh) but the amount of plastics should have reduced year over year if the bans were working (it is implied in the question that a reduction was expected).\n\nNote that E) does not mean that plastics take hundreds of years to wash ashore or that there is a delay in banning and seeing results for hundreds of years. Decomposing was never a solution to reduce plastic waste - banning it was.­\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "explanation": "The archaeologists conclude that . Here’s how they arrive at that conclusion:\n\n\nAnd the question is asking: which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the archaeologists' hypothesis?\n\nTo strengthen this argument, we'll need to rule out other causes of the same pattern of destruction or find evidence that Kourion was actually devastated in A.D. 365, not sometime before or after the earthquake.\n\nIf Kourion was devastated in A.D. 365, we wouldn’t expect to see any drinking vessels originating from after that year. Choice (A) weakens the argument, so we’ll eliminate it.\n\nChoice (B) presents exactly the kind of evidence we need to back the archaeologists. If they found pre-365 coinage in the debris but couldn’t find a single coin created after 365, then we’d be more inclined to believe that the earthquake in A.D. 365 did in fact devastate Kourion. Let’s keep this and continue eliminating choices.\n\nChoice (C) doesn’t give us any new information. It may strengthen the fact that an earthquake took place in this year, but doesn’t strengthen the argument that this earthquake caused the destruction seen in Kourion. Let’s eliminate choice (C).\n\nChoice (D) would neither strengthen nor weaken the argument, which places the destruction of Kourion in A.D. 365. If these small statues were carved between 300 and 365, choice (D) would strengthen the argument. If these small statues were carved between 365 and 400, choice (D) would weaken the argument. Since we don’t know when exactly the statues were carved, we’ll eliminate choice (D).\n\nThis evidence weakens the argument because it presents an artifact that was created  the year of the earthquake in A.D. 365. Let’s eliminate choice (E).\n\nAnswer choice (B) is the best option.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "Guidebook writer: I have visited hotels throughout the country and have noticed that in those built before 1930 the quality of the original carpentry work is generally superior to that in hotels built afterward. Clearly carpenters working on hotels before 1930 typically worked with more skill, care, and effort than carpenters who have worked on hotels built subsequently.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the guidebook writer’s argument?\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Here we have a know-it-all guidebook writer who comes to the following conclusion: \"carpenters working on hotels before 1930 typically worked with more skill, care, and effort than carpenters who have worked on hotels built subsequently.\" How does the guidebook write arrive at that conclusion? (And if you prefer your explanations in video form, check out our .) \n\nWe are trying to explain the quality difference between pre-1930 hotels and post-1930 hotels. How the quality in hotels generally compares to the quality in houses, stores, etc., has no relevance and does not help us evaluate the author's argument or conclusion. Eliminate (A).\n\nOkay, post-1930 hotels can accommodate more guests, but does that impact the quality of the carpentry? Perhaps we could dream up a reason why the higher capacity would negatively affect the original carpentry, but that would require making our own assumptions and introducing ideas not found in the passage. On its own, choice (B) does not help us evaluate the author's argument or conclusion, so it can be eliminated.\n\nIf the materials available to carpenters working before 1930 WERE significantly different in quality, then that would possibly explain the difference in the quality of the carpentry. Having such an alternate explanation would indeed weaken the author's argument. But choice (C) tells us that this alternate explanation is not valid. This only strengthens the author's argument, so eliminate (C).\n\nChoice (D) implies that buildings with low-quality carpentry are likely to fall into disuse and be demolished. So what about the low-quality hotels built before 1930? Well, if choice (D) is true, it is likely that those old, low-quality hotels have fallen into disuse and been demolished. If that's the case, most of the pre-1930s hotels that have NOT been demolished are likely to have HIGH-quality carpentry.\n\nNow the author's argument is in trouble. The author says, \"Most of the pre-1930 hotels have better quality. Therefore, pre-1930 carpenters were better.\" But what if many or even most of the hotels built before 1930 are no longer there? What if they had low-quality carpentry and were already demolished? Perhaps most of the low-quality pre-1930 hotels have been demolished and most of the high-quality pre-1930 hotels are still standing. If (D) is true, then we have no idea what proportion of hotels built before 1930 were high/low-quality. In other words, the writer's data only includes pre-1930 hotels that are still standing and does not take into account pre-1930 hotels that have already been demolished.\n\nAlthough choice (D) doesn't necessarily  the author's conclusion, it certainly weakens the author's reasoning by offering an alternative way to explain the writer's observations. We can no longer conclude that the author's POSSIBLE explanation is the correct one. Now we need more information to reach a logical conclusion. Thus, choice (D) looks good.\n\nThis might imply that today's carpenters are less skilled when they begin working than were pre-1930 carpenters. This, in turn, might explain why carpenters work with less skill, care, and effort today, but that would only serve to strengthen the author's argument. Eliminate (E).\n\n(D) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "The American Revolution arose partly in response to British general search warrants, which gave arbitrary and intrusive powers to government officers. Thus, the founders created the Fourth Amendment to protect against unreasonable and warrant-less intrusions of privacy by a powerful and partisan federal government. During the 20th century, countless dictators have used arbitrary and intrusive surveillance to monitor and suppress dissidents.

You might object: There might be more people walking to the library in Glenwood even though overall fewer people use the library. This is a flaw in choice (B); nevertheless, choice (B) does weaken the argument and no other answer-choice does.\n\n(C) No. This would strengthen the argument.

        "question": "Unlike juvenile diabetes, which is a genetic condition present from birth, type-2 diabetes is acquired in adulthood, generally as a result of obesity and inactivity. The number of cases of type-2 diabetes has been steadily increasing in the United States since 1970, indicating to many researchers that the American population is becoming increasingly heavy and sedentary. If the government wishes to stem the spread of the disease, it should educate the public about the dangers of an inactive, calorie-laden lifestyle and promote healthful diets and exercise. \n\nWhich of the following, if true, provides the strongest reason to believe that the proposed education program will NOT be effective?\n\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of the argument is that the government should educate the public about the dangers of inactivity and poor diet in order to stop the spread of type-2 diabetes. The basis for the claim is that inactivity and poor diet are the main factors in developing type-2 diabetes. We are asked to find a choice that will show that this plan likely will not work. \n\n(A) The fact that schools educate middle school students about a disease that is generally \"acquired in adulthood\" does not address the effectiveness of an adult education plan sponsored by the government. \n\n(B) The fact that the public already has access to this information through the Internet, does not say anything predictive about the effectiveness of the plan. Even with access to the information, there is a good chance that most people are not exposed to the information. \n\n(C) Just because food companies encourage the public to indulge in unhealthful snacks, does not mean that a program that teaches them to do otherwise would not be successful. \n\n(D) The fact that the government has not set aside money for such a program, does not say much about the projected program's effectiveness. \n\n Choice E states that healthful foods and exercise programs are beyond the financial means of many people.

Proponents have claimed astronomically high odds against obtaining a match by chance alone. These odds are based on an assumption that there is independence between the different characteristics represented by a single pattern.\n\nWhich one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the claim of the proponents of DNA fingerprinting?\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "Think of what you have to weaken here: the claim of the proponents of DNA fingerprinting. What is that claim? that odds against obtaining a match by chance alone are astronomical. Say, the odds are something like a 1 in a billion that the DNA fingerprint of one person will match the DNA fingerprint of another person.\n\nYou have to weaken this claim. The author tells you that the odds were calculated assuming that the different characteristics in a pattern are independent. Think of a password. If you have to write a 10 letter password using only letters of the alphabet, there are 26*26*26.....26 = (26)^10 different ways in which you can write it. The odds against two people creating the same password are very high. You are assuming here that each letter is independent of the other 9 letters. What if that is not the case? Say, your password must have at least 2 of the 5 vowels. You have created restrictions. Each letter is not independent of the other letters now. The number of passwords you can create now is significantly lower. \n\nOption (C) tells you that some groups share the same characteristics i.e. of the 10 letters, 5 letters are identical in each password of this group. Now, the chances of getting the same password have increased significantly. This weakens the claim that the odds against finding a match are very high. \n\nThe only other option you could get stuck in is (A) The large amount of genetic material that people share with all other people and with other animals is not included in the DNA fingerprinting procedure.\nThis just tells you that the features that people share are not a part of fingerprinting procedure. This is like telling you that the passwords actually have 15 letters but the first 5 letters are the same for everyone. Basically, it doesn't change our odds at all. We anyway did not include the common part in our calculation. Hence, this option does not weaken the claim.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "The five senses have traditionally been viewed as  distinct yet complementary. Each sense is thought to  have its own range of stimuli that are incapable of stimulating the other senses. However, recent  research has discovered that some people taste a banana and claim that they are tasting blue, or see a  color and say that it has a specific smell. This shows that such people, called synesthesiacs, have senses that do not respect the usual boundaries between the five recognized senses.\n\nWhich one of the following statements, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? \n\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The conclusion is in the last sentence, that some people “have senses that do not respect the usual boundaries between the five recognized senses.” Instead of keeping their senses distinct, these individuals have an overlap. Incidentally, the condition discussed in the stimulus is not made up: synesthesiacs (or synesthetes) have a real condition known as synesthesia. Regardless of that fact, you must find an answer choice that undermines the conclusion of the argument, something that would suggest their senses do respect the usual boundaries. \n\n If the synesthesiacs have a systematic impairment in their use of language it may not be that their senses overlap but rather that they lack the ability to properly express themselves. Thus, their claim to taste a banana and see blue might not be a reflection of that actually occurring but rather a reflection of the words they use to describe taste. If so, this would undermine the conclusion that the senses of synesthesiacs do overlap. This is a difficult answer to identify as correct, and less than 50% of test takers are able to do so. \n\nAnswer choice (B): The appeal of this answer—and many students keep this as a Contender—is that it suggests that perhaps other senses are operating, and some test takers make the judgment that these additional senses account for the sensory overlap in synesthesiacs. Unfortunately, that judgment is not supported by the answer choice. Not enough information is provided by the answer choice to say what role, if any, is played by these other senses. \n\nAnswer choice (C): This is the most popular wrong answer choice. Do not forget to personalize the argument and consider how the author would react if faced with this answer. Would he or she surrender and admit the answer overpowers the argument? Doubtful. The author would probably react to this answer by saying something along these lines, “Exactly. Since all the individuals are synesthesiacs and suffer from the same condition, it is not surprising that there would be patterns in the way the senses overlap. Just as everyone afflicted with emphysema has difficulty breathing, the sensory patterns exhibited by synesthesiacs are just a product of the condition. The fact that their senses do not follow the usual boundaries and do so in certain ways is to be expected.” So, instead of surrendering to the answer, the author would indicate that the answer agrees with the conclusion. \n\nAnswer choice (D): This answer is out of the scope of the argument. The “legendary” status of synesthesiacs does not shed any light on the operation of their five senses. \n\nAnswer choice (E): If anything, this may strengthen the argument by indicating that the synesthesiacs are experiencing some type of phenomenon. Beyond that point, however, no information is given to suggest that their senses do not respect the usual boundaries.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "- Traditionally, elementary school children have received instruction in creating visual art but not in music.\n\n - The author goes on to relate the lack of instruction to an outcome: most people as adults do not recognize the artistic intentions of composers, while they do recognize the artistic intentions of visual artists.\n\n - In order to get adults to recognize artistic intentions of composers, a few educators recommend adding music in the elementary school curriculum.\n\nThe educators recommend something for music that they think worked for visual art. There are two clear gaps in the argument.\n\nFirstly, there is no certainty this worked for visual art. Instruction in school may or may not have been responsible for people’s ability to recognize the artistic intentions of visual art. It is not necessary that the two are ‘causally’ related. The two facts (children receiving instruction in visual art and children recognizing the artistic intention in visual art) might simply be coincidental or correlated without any causation.\n\nThis is a very common flaw seen in Critical Reasoning arguments. \n\nTwo seemingly related events, let’s call them X and Y,  and then the author concludes that X must have caused Y. It is not necessary that the two are causally related. E.g. it is possible that \nHighlighting either of the two gaps will get the job done. Of course, there could be other ways also to show that teaching elementary school students to compose music will not lead to people recognizing the artistic intentions of composers. We, here, were able to come up with two.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe author states that the second statement is a ‘consequence’ of the first statement. Now, whether this relationship between the first and the second statement should be taken as a fact or as an opinion of the author is open for debate. Since the correct option B in this question challenges this relationship, we can say that the relationship was meant to be taken as an opinion of the author.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

It is possible that the competitor had 42% or higher profits in the prior yrs too. This info does not tell us anything about the state of the economy. Had there been info that the economy has been doing particularly well for the last 3 yrs (and not before that), we could have debated that the increase in profit could be due to the improved economic conditions and not the head's efforts. All we know is that Cromwell's profit has been growing by 35% instead of 10%.\n\n(C) The CFO of Crackwell Corporation has taken several cost cutting measures over the last three years, including retrenchment of unproductive employees and renegotiation of prices with vendors.\n\nProfits increase when you either increase revenue or decrease costs or both. This tells us that the increase in profits could be because the CFO is cutting costs. The marketing head is supposed to push the top line i.e. increase the  revenue by marketing the product better. This does make us doubt whether the increase in profit is because of the marketing head's efforts or because of the cost cutting done by CFO. So it does make us doubt the board's decision. Answer.\n\n(D) A strategy consulting firm, known to have turned around several poorly performing companies, has been recently hired by Crackwell Corporation\n\nTwo things here - the firm has been recently hired so it can't be responsible for Crackwell's 3 yr performance. Also, we don't know whether the firm actually did any good for Crackwell. Just because it turned around other companies, it doesn't mean it was effective in this case too.\n\n(E) Several new marketing campaigns, which gave a lot of international exposure to the company’s products, have been successfully conducted by Crackwell Corporation over the past three years\n\nPossibly, marketing head led these campaigns and hence, did a commendable job. There is no reason to not reward him. \n\nAnswer (C)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "Editorial: In Ledland, unemployed adults receive government assistance. To reduce unemployment, the government proposes to supplement the income of those who accept jobs that pay less than government assistance, thus enabling employers to hire workers cheaply. However, the supplement will not raise any worker's income above what government assistance would provide if he or she were not gainfully employed. Therefore, unemployed people will have no financial incentive to accept jobs that would entitle them to the supplement.\n\nWhich of the following, if true about Ledland, most seriously weakens the argument of the editorial?\n",
        "answer": "Added Mod. Editorial Note",
        "explanation": "Responding to a pm:\n\nThe question is about financial incentives.\n\nThis is what the situation is: Say, the govt pays $400/week to the unemployed. Someone who is getting less than $400/week in a job will not work. He will instead like to be unemployed and receive $400. Now, the govt is planning to supplement the income of people who get less than $400. Say, if you get $300/week, the govt will give you $100 to make it $400 but not more than $400. \n\nConclusion: Unemployed people will have to accept jobs that would entitle them to the supplement.\n\nMakes sense, right? Whether you work or you don't you still make only $400. So you might have other incentives to work e.g. you like work etc but you don't have a financial incentive to work. What will weaken this conclusion? It will be weakened if you can find a financial incentive that will make people work.\n\n(C) says that people who are already employed get better pay if they switch jobs (as compared to those who are unemployed). This could be a financial incentive for people to take up jobs. They take low paying jobs right now but still get $400 (after adding govt supplement) and later switch and get better paying jobs, possibly jobs that pay more than $400. Hence, this option gives us a financial incentive.\n\n(A) actually strengthens the argument, if at all. \nA - \"The government collects no taxes on assistance it provides to unemployed individuals and their families.\"\nIf the govt collects no taxes on assistance it provides to unemployed individuals, the unemployed will get $400/week. But the employed will pay taxes on their salary ($300) and may not pay taxes on $100 of govt assistance but overall they will make less than $400. So there is certainly no financial incentive to work. Instead, you make less money if you work. This makes a better case for the author's opinion which is \"unemployed people will have no financial incentive to accept jobs\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "Absolute, or perfect, pitch - the ability to identify the pitch of an isolated musical note - is rare in the general population, but relatively common among trained musicians. A survey of fifteen- year-old music students showed that absolute pitch was more common among those who had been studying music since a very early age than among those who started studying a few years later. Thus very early musical training aids in the development of absolute pitch.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of the argument is the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for the conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nWe see that the reasoning of the argument is basically that, since absolute pitch was more common in survey respondents who had been studying music since a very early age than in those who started studying at a later age, studying music at a very early age helps someone develop absolute pitch.\n\nA simple way of looking at the argument is that its point is basically that studying at an early age causes absolute pitch.\n\n\n\nThis is a Weaken question, and the correct answer will show that, even though the evidence is true, the conclusion may not be correct.\n\n\n\nNotice that the survey mentioned in the argument is \"of fifteen-year-old music students.\" So, the students surveyed are all \"adolescents,\" since a fifteen-year-old person is considered an adolescent.\n\nThus, none of the people surveyed are \"young children\" who \"might not realize\" that they have perfect pitch. In other words, this choice does not indicate that the survey results are suspect. After all, the survey results don't involve \"young children with absolute pitch.\"\n\nThus, this choice has no effect on the strength of the argument since the fact that young children with abolute pitch may not realize they have it does not affect the strength of the support provided by the fact that absolute pitch was more common among those who had been studying music since a very early age than among those who started studying a few years later.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nRegardless of whether this choice is true, it remains the case that absolute pitch was more common among people surveyed who had been studying music since a very early age than among those who started studying a few years later, and that fact still supports the conclusion.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nIf anything, this choice strengthens, rather that weakens, the argument.\n\nAfter all, this new information that, not only most of the fifteen year olds surveyed who have absolute pitch but also most musicians in general who do started their training at a young age, before age 7, do is an additional reason to believe that very early musical training aids in the development of absolute pitch.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nNotice that, regardless of whether development of absolute pitch is the goal of early musical training, its still the case that children who start training earlier are more likely to have abolute pitch than other childen. So, even though development of absolute pitch is not the goal of early musical training, early musical training does appear to result in the development of absolute pitch.\n\nThus, this choice does not weaken the case for the conclusion.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is interesting.\n\nIf children with absolute pitch are more likely to persist in their musical training than are children without absolute pitch, then it could be that the reason why absolute pitch was more common among those who had been studying music since a very early age than among those who started studying a few years later is the following:\n\nA large proportion of the students who started studying at an early age who did not have absolute pitch quit by the time the survey was done. So, the remaining early-age starters included a relatively high proportion of children with absolute pitch.\n\nOn the other hand, not as high a proportion of the later starters had dropped out by the tiime the survey was done since they had been studying for less time. After all, they started later. So, there hasn't been as much time since they started for them to quit. Thus, not as high a percentage of those later starters without absolute pitch had quit by the time the survey was done.\n\nIn tthat case, the reason for the greater proportion having absolute pitch among those who started early could be attributed to, not their early training, but instead the greater proportion of non-absolute-pitch-having children in the early starter group having dropped out.\n\nSo, this choice indicates that there could be a different reason why absolute pitch was more common among those who had been studying music since a very early age than among those who started studying a few years later: It's not that earlier training causes absolute pitch. It's just that people's having quit in different proportions left different proportions of children with absolute pitch in the two groups.\n\nThus, this choice casts doubt on the conclusion that early training helps to cause absolute pitch by providing a possible alternative cause for the observed difference.\n\nKeep.\n\n E­",

We don't care whether the predators or parasites damage the willow trees directly. Choice (A) is irrelevant and can be eliminated.\n\nIf there are more parasites in areas with severe air pollution, then those parasites would further help to LIMIT the beetle populations. This effect should REDUCE the amount of damage done by the beetles to the willows.

This is a causative statement where the Paleo links cold to population decline, with a keyword \"indirectly\". So, in previous statement, the Paleo opined that cold did not lead to death of bottom dwelling creatures and provided a reason for the same. In this statement, Paleo introduces his own theory of how cold might have effected bottom dwelling creatures. So, this statement could be called an opinion or conclusion or judgement or hypothesis of the Paleo.\n\n6.  - This is BF2. This says that Plankton suffered a sever population decline. Read this statement with the preceding statement, which said Plankton was food for bottom dwelling creatures.

Thus, this statement is irrelevant.  \n\nD. \nInteresting.  This would provide a completely different explanation of why so many people with asthma wound up in competitive swimming.  It's not that being in the pool causes the asthma (the naive, rash conclusion); instead, the people who already had asthma were sent to the pool.   This is promising.  \n\nE. \nAgain, the comparison in the prompt is between competitive swimmers vs. those who do other competitive athletes.  If all the people with \"latent asthma\" develop full-blown asthma when they start doing strenuous athletic activity, why would it show up only for swimmers and not for all other kinds of athletes.

        "question": "Cholesterol, which is a known factor in coronary heart disease and stroke, needs a carrier, known as a lipoprotein, to transport it through the bloodstream. Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) increase the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke, but we can tentatively conclude that high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) help prevent coronary heart disease and stroke. First, aerobic exercise increases one’s level of HDLs. Second, HDL levels are higher in women than in men. And both aerobic exercise and being female are positively correlated with lower risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.\n\nEach of the following, if true, strengthens the argument EXCEPT:\n\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "I have big problems with the logic here. (I bet you’re shocked.) The conclusion of the argument is, “We can tentatively conclude that HDLs help prevent coronary heart disease and stroke.” But the evidence is shaky. Let’s start with the link between HDLs and aerobic exercise. The logic goes like, “Aerobic exercise increases your HDLs, and aerobic exercise is correlated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke, therefore HDLs help prevent heart disease and stroke.” Huh? What if\n\nI had said this instead? “Aerobic exercise increases your sexiness, and aerobic exercise is correlated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke, therefore sexiness helps prevent heart disease and stroke.” Does that make any sense? Nope, and it’s the same exact logic used by the author.\n\nThe same problem exists with the “being female” rationale for why HDLs supposedly lower your risk of heart disease and stroke. All we have here is correlation, and you must always remember that correlation does not prove causation.\n\nThe question asks us to identify the single correct answer that does  strengthen the argument. So there are four potential strengtheners and one correct answer that is either irrelevant or actually weakens the argument. Let’s see.\n\nA) This would make the argument start to make some sense, because it proposes a mechanism whereby HDLs could help reduce heart disease and stroke. We’re told that cholesterol is a known factor in coronary heart disease and stroke, so if HDLs help get rid of cholesterol then that’s a good thing. This is causation, rather than mere correlation. This is a strengthener, so it is not our answer.\n\nB) This is an additional factor showing a  between HDLs and heart disease and stroke. We already had two factors indicating the correlation, and I’m not sure a third really helps all that much. A fairly common incorrect answer on a Strengthen question is one that repeats a premise that’s already in evidence. Since we already knew the variables were correlated, I don’t see how this is a strengthener—which would make it a good answer for this “strengthen… EXCEPT” question. I’m hoping C through E are all strengtheners like A so that I can confidently choose B.\n\nC) Oh man. This seems completely irrelevant to me. At least B provided an additional correlative factor. What does “removed from the bloodstream” have to do with anything? I don’t even see that concept in the argument anywhere. I like this answer best so far, because it’s the  irrelevant. At least B would reinforce the argument. This one doesn’t do ****.\n\nD) This says that HDLs help lower your health risks, which is a  relationship. This is a good strengthener, so it’s not our answer.\n\nE) This is another data point in favor of the correlation between HDLs and good health. It’s not a wonderful strengthener, but at least it’s relevant.\n\nC, being entirely irrelevant, must be our answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

So, okay, there is a small chance that the bilby population will be hurt be the population. But for this one piece of evidence to lead to the conclusion that the plan will increase the threat to local wildlife, we have to assume that introducing the virus wouldn't help local wildlife in some way that would be more significant than this small threat of infecting the bilby. In fact, we have to assume that the plan won't help the bilby itself in some way that would prove more significant than the small threat. \n\nThat's a direct match for answer choice B. \n\nIf we don't have a clear prediction, we can use the denial test:\n\nDenying B we get, 'Overgrazing by the rabbits DOES pose the greatest threat to the bilby population.\" If this were the case, then introducing the virus would reduce the .

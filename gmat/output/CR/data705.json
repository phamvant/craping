        "question": "In a ten-year study, one group of volunteers was given a medical screening for disease X every year, whereas an otherwise similar group of the same size was only screened for disease X at the end of the study. Nine percent of the first group were diagnosed with disease X during the study and received treatment, but only six percent of the second group were diagnosed with disease X when they received the screening at the end of the study. The researchers concluded that during the ten-year period, disease X must have disappeared without medical treatment in some individuals in the second group.\n\nIn order to evaluate the strength of the researcher's reasoning, it would be most helpful to know which of the following?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Here's my take:\n\n\n\nThe researchers' conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nThe researchers' reasoning is essentially the following:\n\nSince nine percent of the volunteers in the screened group were diagnosed with disease X during the ten-year period of the study, it stands to reason that around nine percent of the group that was screened only at the end of the study also experienced disease X during the ten-year period of the study. Thus, the reason why only six percent of the volunteers in the second group were diagnosed with disease X at the end of the study must be that disease X did appear in some other individuals in the second group but disappeared without treatment.\n\nThe correct answer will help with evaluating whether the conclusion follows from the researchers' reasoning.\n\n\n\nThis choice uses the term \"statistically significant\" to seem important, but we can shorten this choice to \"whether there were ... lifestyle differences between the individuals who were diagnosed with disease X and those who were not.\"\n\nNow, what we need to notice to see why the answer to the question posed by this choice doesn't affect the argument is the following. This choice about differences between people diagnosed with disease X and people not diagnosed with disease X whereas the argument is about a difference between the rates of diagnosis in two groups of people, in each of which some members were diagnosed with disease X and others were not.\n\nPut simply, this choice and the argument are about two different differences. So, regardless of what the answer to this question is, that answer doesn't affect the argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nRegardless of how many people volunteered for or participated in the study because they had an especially high risk for disease X, that information would not give us any insight into why there was a difference between the percentages of the volunteers in the two groups who experienced disease X. After all, that information would not indicate that there was any difference between the risks for disease X of the members of the two groups.\n\nIn fact, the passage tells us that, other than in the way the volunteers in the two groups were screened for disease X, the two groups were \"similar.\" So, presumably, the risk for disease X of the volunteers in the two groups was, on average, similar.\n\nSo, the information mentioned by this choice would help us to understand only the risk for disease X of all the volunteers in the two groups, not any difference between the two groups.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nInformation on how long it takes to be  for disease X does not help us to understand why there was a difference between the percentages of the members of the two groups who were  with disease X. After all, regardless of how long it takes to be treated for disease X, it remains the case that more people in the first group than in the second group were diagnosed with disease X, and the volunteers in both groups had the same amount of time to develop disease X.\n\nSo, regardless of how long it takes to be treated for disease X, we still have basically the same information about people being diagnosed with disease X we had before.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nRegardless of whether the volunteers were told what disease they were being screened for, they were still diagnosed with disease X in different percentages in the two groups, and this choice does not help us to determine why that difference existed.\n\nAfter all, even if there's some way telling the volunteers would have affected whether they experienced disease X, this choice does not say that the volunteers in one group but not the other were told what disease they were being screened for.\n\nSo, regardless of whether, yes, this choice is true or, no, this choice is not true, the support the evidence we have provides for the conclusion is the same.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe information mentioned by this choice would help us to evaluate the case for believing that disease X must have disappeared without medical treatment in some individuals in the second group.\n\nAfter all, if the answer is that the medical screening used in the study NEVER produces erroneous diagnoses of disease X, then we have eliminated a possible alternative cause for the  difference between the percentages of the volunteers in the two groups diagnosed with disease X. We've eliminated the possibility that the difference is attributable to erroneous diagnoses. So, information that the frequency of erroneous diagnoses is never strengthens the case for the researchers' conclusion.\n\nOn the other hand, if the medical screening used in the study OFTEN produces erroneous diagnoses of disease X, then we have a possible alternative cause for the difference between the percentages of the volunteers in the two groups diagnosed with disease X. It could be that the reason for the difference is that some of the diagnoses of the volunteers in the first group were erroneous.\n\nIn fact, notice that, if the medical screening often produces erroneous diagnoses of disease X, then the fact that the members of the first group were screened more gave them more opportunities to be erroneously diagnosed with disease X.\n\nSo, the information that the frequency of erroneous diagnoses is often weakens the case for the researchers' conclusion by providing reason to believe that there may have been a different cause for the difference between the percentages of the volunteers in the two groups diagnosed with disease X.\n\nSo, having information on how frequently the medical screening produces erroneous diagnoses of disease X would help us to strengthen or weaken the case for the researchers' conclusion and thus evaluate the argument.\n\nThe correct answer is (E).",

However, awards for children’s literature are typically given to serious, realistic narratives, often featuring important historical persons and events. Therefore, since adults give preference to award-winning titles when selecting books to provide to children, awards for children’s literature have the unintended consequence of discouraging reading among school-age children.\n\nIn assessing the conclusion above, it would be useful to determine which of the following?\n\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Official Explanation:\n\n \n\nThe words  in the question stem indicate that this is an Evaluate the Argument question.\n\n\n \nThe first two sentences are premises that seem to draw a contrast between the kinds of books that children are likely to finish reading and the kinds of books that are likely to receive awards. In the final sentence, the author provides one more premise——before concluding that awards discourage children from reading. \n\n \n\nFor an Evaluate question, the goal is to find the answer that addresses an assumption of the argument. The answer to the question or consideration in the correct answer should help to strengthen or weaken the argument, so it’s important to identify the assumptions of the argument. This argument relies on two key, unstated assumptions:\n\n\nFor the first of these assumptions, who says that serious, realistic books can’t also be funny or have relatable characters? The author just assumes that the award-winning books are more lacking in these traits than average.\n\nAs for the second assumption, the author is trying to build a case that these awards discourage reading because they entice adults to buy books that kids are apparently less likely to finish. However, even if a kid doesn’t finish a book, does that automatically mean they are discouraged from reading?\n\n\n\n(A) This choice addresses only children who do actually finish a book. It doesn’t address whether children actually  finish books about historical characters. Also, this choice doesn’t indicate whether the books it mentions are award-winners.\n\n(B) The argument already says that children are more likely to finish books with a preferred trait. Beyond that, it isn’t helpful to know anything about completion rates for books with all three traits, especially since there is no information given on how common such books are among regular and award-winning books. \n\n(C) This is tempting because the conclusion states that the awards have an . The award doesn’t have to have the goal of encouraging reading in order for it to have the unintended consequence of discouraging reading. For example, the goal of the award could be to reward talented artists or to increase children’s awareness of historical events. \n\n(D) The final premise establishes that adults are somehow able to give preference to these books, so it isn’t necessary to know that the award is indicated on the cover. As for kids, this might go either way. First, do they know that they are less likely to finish an award-winner? And if so, does this discourage them, or does it enable them to detect and avoid the books they don’t want to read? On its own, this choice does nothing to address the assumptions. \n\n This choice addresses the first assumption. It isn’t clear from the premises that award winners are more likely to lack the three preferred traits. There is also no information about how often -award winners have these traits. If award-winning books are less likely to have the three preferred traits, then the author’s conclusion may be correct. If, on the other hand, award-winning books are just as likely as other books to have at least one trait from the list, then the author’s conclusion is less likely to be correct.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

After all, if, as the passage says, the researcher predicted 90 percent of the divorces, then we know that the researcher did not predict 10 percent of the divorces since 100 percent - 90 percent = 10 percent.\n\n\n\nThe answer to this question is irrelevant. Regardless of whether other factors have a greater impact on the longevity of a marriage, it could be the case that the way spouses speak to each other is an important determinant of how their relationships turn out.\n\n\n\nNotice that, even if some couples spoke well to each other and got divorced, it still could be the case that the way spouses speak to each other is an important determinant of how their relationships turn out. The conclusion is not that speaking well solves all relationship problems. Also, “any” could be just one or two couples.\n\nAlso, the support for the conclusion is that the researcher predicted 90 percent of the divorces that occurred. So, we already know that 10 percent of the divorces were not predicted through observation of how the people spoke to each other. Thus, the answer to this question would not provide any useful new information.\n\n\n\nNotice that, if the answer to this question is “a large proportion,” then the support for the conclusion is weakened.. After all, in that case, it appears that the researcher simply predicted that most of the couples, both those who did get divorced and those who didn’t, would get divorced.\n\nSo, in that case, the fact that the researcher correctly predicted the divorces is meaningless. The researcher’s method didn’t really work. He just predicted that most people would get divorced, and his prediction seemed correct in the cases of people who did get divorced.\n\nSo, if the answer to this question is  “a high proportion,” the fact that the researcher predicted the divorces doesn’t provide much support for the conclusion.\n\nOn the other hand, if the answer to this question is “a small proportion,” then the researcher’s method seems to work well, and the argument is strengthened.\n\nThus the answer to this question is helpful in evaluating the argument.\n\n\n\nThe  answer to this question is not helpful because the observations and predictions remain essentially the same regardless of whether the researcher himself made the observations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

After all, dental decay could occur regardless of whether they did or didn't use grass stalks for tooth picking.\n\nEliminate.\n\n \n\nThe fact that grass suitable for tooth picking may have existed where early humans' teeth did not have the grooves doesn't tell us whether the grooves were caused by use of grass for cleaning teeth.

I will only discuss (B) &amp; (C) since those are the answers in contention.  \n\n\nWell, the treasure hunter explicitly states that treasure hunters \"\", so he states that the treasure hunters are at risk.  He also explicitly states that the sunken ships are headed to \"oblivion\", which implies that they are decaying and vanishing, and will take the treasure with them.  Thus, he also implies the sunken ships are at risk.  So far, from the treasure hunter's side, both claims are stated.  \nNow, from the archaeologist's side.  The archaeologist states, \"...\"  In other words, if the treasure hunters simply stayed away, the ship would be fine, not at all in danger.  So, without any pesky treasure hunters swimming around it, the sunken ships are at no risk.  \n\nThe treasure hunter and the archaeologist clearly and explicitly disagree on whether the sunken ships are at risk, whether they are in any peril.  That's clear.  That's why (B) is correct.  \nThe treasure hunter also clearly feels treasure hunters put themselves at risk.  By contrast, the archaeologist says nothing about the relative risk to which the treasure hunters are exposed.   Does the archaeologist feel the treasure hunters are at risk? We don't know.  Maybe the archaeologist thinks they are not at risk.  Maybe the archaeologist thinks they are at risk and because they are doing something criminal, they deserve whatever bad things happens to them in the process.   We don't know.  The archaeologist's reply characterizes the treasure hunters as \"greedy\", as \"looting\", as \"in [a] hurry\" --- it makes clear that the archaeologist thinks the treasure hunters are  destruction, posing a threat to the sunken ship, but this reply does not explicitly address in any way the issue of whether the treasure hunters themselves are at risk.  That's why (C) is not correct.  \n\nDoes all this make sense?\n\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)",

        "explanation": "­Here's a brief explanation addressing popular options A, B, and C.\n\n Only A is an assumption since its negation breaks down the argument. Neither negation of B nor negation of C breaks down the argument.\n\n: The price of rayon will soon exceed the price of cotton. - If the price of rayon becomes higher than the price of cotton, how will it make sense for clothing manufacturers to blend more rayon?! In such a case, they will rather use more of cotton. So, the negation of A breaks down the argument.\n\n: (This is tricky) The price of rayon  to changes due to  of the agricultural difficulties that cotton is subject to.\n\nWe get to know that SOME of the agricultural difficulties will also apply to rayon. So, we can expect SOME increase in the price of rayon. However, SOME increase does not break down the argument based on skyrocketing prices of cotton. \n\n \"The price of rayon is not subject to changes due to some of the agricultural difficulties that cotton is subject to.\"\n\nThen its negation would be \"The price of rayon  to changes due to ALL of the agricultural difficulties that cotton is subject to.\"\n\nSo, all the agricultural difficulties that apply to cotton also apply to rayon. In this case, the argument breaks down.\n\nHowever, the negation of original option B DOES NOT break down the argument.\n\n: Increasing demand for rayon is likely to cause its price to rise.\n\nJust as in the case of B, some price rise WILL NOT break down the argument.\n\n \"Increasing demand for rayon is unlikely to cause its price to rise to the same extent as the price of cotton.\"\n\nThen its negation would be \"Increasing demand for rayon is likely to cause its price to rise to the same extent as the price of cotton.\"\n\nIf both prices are rising to the same extent, we don't have a reason to expect clothing manufacturers to switch from cotton to rayon. Thus, the argument breaks down in this modified version of option C.\n\nHowever, the argument doesn't break down in the case of negation of the original option C.

A corporation has offered to base a national long-distance telephone service in the province, allowing long-distance calls to be made without any charge to the callers, if the provincial government splits its subsidy with the corporation. The corporation argues that since all calls would be routed through the province, the provincial government would profit greatly from this arrangement.\n\nThe corporation's prediction about the effects its plan would have, if adopted, relies on which of the following assumptions?\n",

So, by basing a national long-distance telephone service in the province and thus causing many long-distance calls to be routed into the province, the corporation will cause a large volume of subsidies to be paid to the provincial government.\n\nThe correct answer will be an assumption that the corporation has relied on in making the prediction.\n\n\n\nWhat this choice says seems plausible. However, we are not looking for a plausible statement. We are looking for an assumption on which the prediction relies, and the prediction could be correct even if this choice is not true.\n\nAfter all, even if it is the case that, without the plan, SOME long-distance telephone service in the province would NOT involve at least some charges to callers, the plan of collecting the subsidies by routing calls into the province could still be profitable for the provincial government.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nNotice that the plan is the following:\n\n the province, the corporation will cause a large volume of subsidies to be paid to the provincial government.\n\nThe corporation is probably assuming what this choice says in coming up with the plan. However, we are not looking for something that is simply an assumption the corporation is making. We are looking for an assumption the prediction relies on, and the prediction does not rely on this choice.\n\nAfter all, if this choice were not true, and the provincial government would be interested in splitting its subsidy with the corporation EVEN IF doing so would NOT yield significant profits for the province, the plan as outlined would still result in the predicted outcome that the provincial government would profit greatly.\n\nThe prediction is about what would occur if the corporation's plan were implemented, not about what the provincial government is \"interested in\" doing. The provincial government could be interested in doing something that would not be profitable, but that fact would not affect what the outcome of this particular plan would be.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nNotice that the corporation's plan is to allow long-distance calls to be made \"without any charge to the callers.\"\n\nThus, if this choice were true, the plan would not work at all since a fixed percentage of no charge would be no subsidy.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is tricky because it mentions an aspect of the plan.

        "question": "People want to be instantly and intuitively liked. Those persons who are perceived as forming opinions of others only after cautiously gathering and weighing the evidence are generally resented. Thus, it is imprudent to appear prudent. \n\nWhich one of the following, if assumed, enables the argument’s conclusion to be properly drawn?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Hello, jn0r!\n\nFirst, because this is an  question, the most important thing to find is the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion comes in the last sentence: \"It is imprudent to appear prudent.\"\n\nNext, try to find what's problematic about the conclusion. Does it introduce new terms? Is it too extreme or definitive? Does it gloss over an intermediate point that needs to be established? I usually find it helpful to figure out how the significant words and phrases in the conclusion connect to the premises. In this case, \"imprudent\" and \"appear prudent\" are the significant words. Where in the premises have we discussed anything related to prudence and imprudence?\n\nIn this argument, \"appear prudent\" probably calls to \"cautiously gathering and weighing the evidence.\" And that's a pretty fair connection--by definition, prudence involves caution and careful, deliberate consideration.\n\nThe problem comes from the \"imprudent\" in the conclusion. If we look in the premises for something connected to imprudence, we come up empty--there's nothing there that specifically speaks to a lack of caution or careful consideration. We do have a bit of a negative consequence introduced in the premise, however: people who show prudence in choosing a friend will likely be  Of course, being resented is not the same thing as being imprudent--and  where the assumption comes into play. The job of an assumption is to repair a subtly faulty connection between the premise and the conclusion. It's not necessarily \"imprudent\" to curry resentment; therefore, we need to establish such a connection to make this conclusion work.\n\n\nAmong these answers, only (E) makes this necessary connection between the questionable term in the conclusion and the closest equivalent in the premise. As to the other answers, the question I usually ask myself is whether the answer helps me to better decide whether the conclusion is valid or not. Usually, this means that a correct answer needs to touch on at least one key term from the conclusion, as (E) does here.\n\n(A) Knowing that people who act spontaneously (that is,  prudently) are well-liked doesn't have any bearing on whether people who act prudently are  well-liked, even though it seems as though one would be a natural consequence of the other. So this doesn't help us to decide whether the conclusion is valid or not.\n\n(B) This answer gives us a definition for \"imprudent people,\" but it doesn't help us to decide whether it's a good idea to \"appear prudent.\" This is a common, particularly effective type of trap answer in CR and RC, one that uses a key term to appear correct but says the wrong thing about that key term.\n\n(C) If anything, the natural consequence of this answer is that it's a  idea to appear at least as prudent as others if you want to evade their resentment, so it runs counter to the conclusion that it's a bad idea to appear prudent. This is bad news: the job of the assumption is to make the conclusion more valid, not less.\n\n(D) This answer, like (B), gives us a sort of definition: if you're intuitive, you'll know instantly whether you like someone. But even knowing that, it's hard to make the kind of value judgment that the conclusion of the argument makes (namely, that it's a  idea to appear too slow to like someone). \n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, , and  Instructor",

The key is to find a link and work with it. \n\nSo, we should find a confirmation that all our four questions about other reasons  are wrong and the tax is the  reason why sales were lost.\n\nLet's analyze answers:\n\n\nIt looks like a strong contender but here is the example why this is the wrong answer: \n2015 - the price of one pack equal to $10 and was increased to $15 . \n1% of smokers decide that $15 is too much and stop buying this type of cigarettes.\n2016 - tax increase $0,08 and price increase $4,99.\nFinal price $20,07 - 10% of smokers switch to another type of cigarettes.\nThis is quite obvious that the main reason for losing sales is not the tax but price increasing.\n\n\nIt can be true, but what if the price of cigarettes was increased by 10 dollars in 2016?\n2015 - the price of one pack equal to $10. 1% of smokers stop buying this type of cigarettes.\n2016 - the tax increase $0,08 and price increase by $10.\nWho is the guilty? Definitely not the tax.\n\n\nThis answer makes this question very doubtful and maybe this is not a really GMAT Prep question.\nI think, authors of this question wanted to say that price was increased  the years and because of it this answer is wrong.  \n\n\nLet's negate this one:\n2015 - price of pack equal to $1\n2016 - tax increase $0,08 and price was lowered on $0,07\nThe final price equal to 1,01$.\nSo the businessman did all he can do (he decreased price) but the tax is killed his sales.\n\n\nIn this case, the price can be the reason why sales were lost.\n\n\nP.S.

So they must have needed to climb into their mother's pouches too. The argument assumes here that forelimbs were developed for a reason and that reason was 'climbing into mother's pouch'. It assumes that if the lions did not have a need for the forelimbs to be developed, the forelimbs would not have been developed. Since the forelimbs were developed at birth, it was for a reason. Hence E is correct.\n\nAs for D, the argument is not assuming this. \nD - Newborn marsupial lions that crawled into their mothers’ pouches could not have done so had they not had only their forelimbs developed at birth.\n\nThe argument says that developed forelimbs implies crawling into mother's pouch. It doesn't say that crawling into mothers' pouches implies developed forelimbs. Notice what has been found and what has been implied. It has been found that these lions had developed forelimbs. This implies that they crawled into pouches.\n\nIf we were given that it has been found that the lions crawled into their mothers' pouches and that this implies that their forelimbs must have been developed, then we could have said that the argument is assuming that without developed forelimbs, the lions could not have crawled into their mothers' pouches.

        "question": "Botanist: On the remote island of Tropica, it is known that early settlers brought a special variety of sunflower plant to cultivate on their arrival over 10,000 years ago. All of the sunflowers on the island today, both wild and farmed, have descended from that original variety. By studying today’s wild sunflower plants on the island of Tropica, we can learn much more about that original variety of sunflower because the wild plants have not been selectively cultivated over the years as the farmed plants have.\n\nThe botanist’s argument depends on which of the following assumptions?\n\n",

        "explanation": "Responding to a pm:\n\nPremises:\nEarly settlers brought a special variety of sunflower plant to cultivate.\nToday, all sunflowers are descendants of that variety. (So even if there were other varieties before, they are extinct now on this island)\n\nConclusion's intent:\nBy studying today’s wild sunflower plants on the island of Tropica, we can learn much more about that original variety than by studying farmed plants. \n\nThere is a disconnect here. Premises talk generally about the farmed and wild varieties. How do we conclude that it is better to study the wild variety than the farmed one to learn about the original variety?\nWe are assuming that the wild variety is more similar to the original variety and that is why it is better to study the wild variety to know about the original variety than to study the farmed variety. Hence (B) is your assumption.\n\nWhat about (D)? If anything, it is a weakener to our conclusion i.e. its role is opposite to that of an assumption. (D) says that farmed variety is very close to the original variety. This is actually against our conclusion which says that you must study the wild variety to know about the original variety. The assumption has to support our conclusion, in fact it is necessary for our conclusion.\nHence (D) is out. People who got lost in (D) probably got confused because they negated (D) and then found that it supports the conclusion. Please remember, an assumption must support the conclusion; in fact, it must be necessary for the conclusion.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

By saying that out of the current 70 opera companies, 45 were founded in the last 30 yrs i.e. much more than half were found in the last 30 yrs.\nWhat is the assumption? 50 opera companies did not shut shop in the last 30 yrs i.e. more than 45 companies did not close down.

The skeletons do show deposits of tetracycline, an antibiotic produced by a bacterium common in Nubian soil. This bacterium can flourish on the dried grain used for making two staples of the Nubian diet, beer and bread.

So, this tetracycline could not have prevented typhus while they were living since it entered after their bodies were buried.\n\nHowever, the original option A is wrong because the negation of the original option A means that . We don't have a problem with this; the deposits could have formed after the death of those people; we just need tetracycline to be in their bodies while they were alive. Rather, \"deposits\" are expected to form over a long period of time. Thus, the fact that they formed after the death of Nubians doesn't mean that tetracycline was not there in the bodies of Nubians while they were alive. Tetracycline could easily have been in their bodies while they were alive, and then once they died, deposits formed over a long period of time. Simple!",

        "question": "Climate researchers examined sediments in a cave in Region Z, which now has a temperate climate, and they found arctic lemming bones in a buried layer corresponding to about 14,000 B.C. Arctic lemmings are typical of arctic climates and are unlikely to have changed their adaptation for temperature over a period as short as 16,000 years. So Region Z probably had an arctic climate around 14,000 B.C.\n\nWhich of the following is an assumption that the argument requires?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of the argument is the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for the conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nWe see that the argument goes from evidence involving the climate arctic lemmings are adapted to to a conclusion about the climate of Region Z around 14,000 B.C.\n\n\n\nThis is an Assumption question. So, the correct answer will be the one that's necessary for the evidence to effectively support the conclusion.\n\n\n\nAs we saw above, the argument goes from the evidence that bones of lemmings were found in a layer corresponding to the time around 14,000 B.C. and that lemmings are adapted to arctic climates to the conclusion that Region Z had an arctic climate around 14,000 B.C.\n\nFor the evidence to effectively support the conclusion, the adaptation of lemmings to arctic climates must be connected to the climate in Region Z around 14,000 B.C.\n\nSo, for the argument to work, the assumption that arctic lemmings were, around 14,000 B.C., well adapted to the climate of Region Z is necessary.\n\nAfter all, if lemmings were NOT well adapted to that climate, then the fact that lemming bones were found in Region Z would not be a reason to believe that Region Z had an arctic climate. After all, in that case, lemmings could have been adapted to an arctic climate while Region Z had a different kind of climate to which the lemmings were not well adapted.\n\nSo, this choice states an assumption upon which the argument relies.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that Region Z DID have an arctic climate around 14,000 B.C. The conclusion is not that Region Z DID NOT have an artic climate before or after around 14,000 B.C.\n\nSo, it's not necessary to assume that adjacent layers did not contain bones of arctic lemmings. After all, regardless of whether adjacent layers contained bones of artic lemmings, Region Z could have had an artic climate at the time corresponding to the layer examined.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe argument's conclusion is basically that there was ONE temperature shift, a shift from an artic climate that existed around 14,000 B.C. to a temperate climate exisiting now.\n\nTo conclude that one temperature shift occurred does not require assuming that such temperature shifts are \"common.\" After all, even if such temperature shifts are NOT common, one such shift could have occurred.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is tricky because the presence of bones of warm-weather animals could seem to disprove the conclusion that Region Z had an artic climate. So, for the argument to work, it could seem necessary to assume that no bones of warm-weather animals were found in the area.\n\nWhat we need to notice, however, is that the conclusion of the argument is about a specific time period, the time period around 14,000 B.C. So, as long as no bones of warm-weather animals are tied to that period, the argument works.\n\nThus, the assumption that no bones of warm-weather animals from ANY period were found in nearby caves in Region Z is not necessary. After all, even if bones of warm-weather animals from a period other than around 14,000 B.C. were found, the argument could still work.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe reasoning of the argument is basically that, since lemmings are adapted to arctic climates, Region Z had an arctic climate.\n\nSo, this choice is an opposite trap that casts doubt on rather than supports the conclusion.\n\nAfter all, if the species of lemming whose bones were found was probably not well adapted for survival in Region Z, then if the lemmings were adapted for an artic climate, then Region Z probably did not have an artic climate.\n\nEliminate.\n\n A",

        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "One thing you see a lot of in Assumption questions is a conclusion that rests upon a single premise, and either the conclusion or the premise has a little bit of \"extra\" language that makes it extra specific and therefore doesn't quite fit with its counterpart.\n\nHere I'd say that the \"by observation\" is that extra language in the premise.  The whole premise is that no mathematical proposition can be proven true . (Which is pretty specific - that's just one method of proving something)  And then the conclusion is more general \"it's therefore impossible to know any mathematical proposition to be true.\"  Note that the premise goes far more specific than the conclusion, making the broader conclusion really hard to prove with such a limited, targeted premise.  That's a  error, a common logical gap on CR questions where a limited premise is used to (try to) prove a much broader, more general conclusion.  Here it's like saying:\n\n  Basically it's \"you can't accomplish a job with this one tool, so therefore you can't accomplish this job.\"  As you read that, if you notice that extra specificity of the premise, you really ought to be thinking \"what about other tools?!\"\n\nAnd that's what (E) exposes.  If proving something true \"requires proving it true by observation\" then the argument holds - if observation is the  to prove something, and in this case we can't use observation to prove math rules to be true, then yeah you just can't prove them to be true.  \n\nAnd here's where the Assumption Negation Technique can be really helpful in turning an Assumption question (they tend to be kind of dense and less approachable) into a Weaken question (we're all good at criticizing other people's arguments!).   If you negate (E), you pretty much find that objection \"hey what if there are other tools to prove something to be true\" \n\nKnowing a proposition to be true   proving it true by observation.\n\nThe negated (E) shows that observation isn't the only way to prove something to be true, thereby blowing apart that gap between the narrow premise and the broad conclusion.\n\nOne large lesson here: I'd say that this one is like many, many CR questions in that it's harder and more time consuming to try to attack it with pure process of elimination (you mentioned eliminating C and D).  If you take the time to analyze the argument and see this one as a generalization error, you can anticipate an answer dealing with the flaw of \"hey what if there are other methods besides just observation\" and (E) should look really promising.  Whereas with dense, kind of abstractly worded (this *definitely* feels like that abstract formal logic LSAT style) answer choices process-of-elimination can be pretty hard if you don't really know what you're looking for.",

After all, \"This decline is probably attributable, at least in part, to off-road vehicle use,\" is supported by the statements that follow it, \"The number of off-road vehicles has been increasing steadily,\" and \"Their use disrupts sensitive bird habitats.\"\n\nHowever, the second and third parts of this choice are incorrect since since, as we just saw, the second boldfaced portion supports the first and thus is a premise rather than the main conclusion of the argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is completely incorrect.\n\nFor one thing, it's not the case that the first boldface supports the second. Rather, \"This decline is probably attributable, at least in part, to off-road vehicle use,\" is supported by the facts \"The number of off-road vehicles has been increasing steadily,\" and \"Their use disrupts sensitive bird habitats.\"\n\nAccordingly, we can see also that the second boldface supports the first and is not supported by any other statement in the argument. Thus, the second is a premise rather than a conclusion of the argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe very beginning of this choice is correct since the first boldfaced portion does support the main conclusion of the argument.\n\nHowever, this choice quickly goes wrong because the main conclusion is not \"the only conclusion drawn in the argument\" Rather, the first boldfaced portion is also a conclusion, an intermediate conclusion that is supported by the two sentences that follow it.\n\nAlso, the second part of this choice is incorrect because, while the second boldfaced portion is a premise, it doesn't directly support the main conclusion of the argument. Rather, it supports the first boldfaced portion.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice may be the trickiest choice in this question. It's easy to get the impression that the first boldfaced portion is the main conclusion of the argument if you read the argument too fast and miss the fact that the first sentence states the main conclusion, and then the second boldfaced portion can seem to be supported by the sentence between the two boldfaced portions. Thus, if we're not careful, we can decide that this choice is correct.\n\nHowever, as we saw, the main conclusion of the argument is stated by the first sentence of the passage, which is supported by the first boldfaced portion.\n\nAlso, the second boldfaced portion is not a conclusion supported by anything else in the passage. Rather, it's simply a statement of fact about the use of off-road vehicles.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice matches exactly what we have seen through analysis of the argument and our review of the other choices.\n\nThe first boldfaced portion is a conclusion that is supported by the two statements that follow it, one of which is the second boldfaced portion.\n\nThen the first boldfaced portion supports the main conclusion of the argument, which is the first statement of the passage.

Therefore, pedigree organizations should set standards requiring working ability in pedigreed dogs classified as working dogs.\n\nThe phrase “certain traits like herding ability risk being lost among pedigreed dogs” serves which one of the following functions in the argument?\n\n",
        "answer": "added source",
        "explanation": "The argument has an interesting structure. Visually, the argument appears as follows:  Pedigreed dogs, including those officially classified as working dogs, must conform to standards set by organizations that issue pedigrees.  Those standards generally specify the physical appearance necessary for a dog to be recognized as belonging to a breed but stipulate nothing about other genetic traits, such as those that enable breeds originally developed as working dogs to perform the work for which they were developed.  Dog breeders try to maintain only those traits specified by pedigree organizations, and traits that breeders do not try to maintain risk being lost. \n\n Certain traits like herding ability risk being lost among pedigreed dogs. Conclusion: Therefore, pedigree organizations should set standards requiring working ability in pedigreed dogs classified as working dogs. Given the size of the stimulus, this is a tough problem to analyze. The second to last sentence contains both a premise and a conclusion. The final sentence contains the main conclusion. Perhaps because of the size of the problem, the test makers kindly inserted the conclusion indicator “therefore” before the main conclusion. \n\nAnswer choice (A): This is a Half Right, Half Wrong answer. The phrase referenced in the question is a “claim on which the argument depends,” but it is not one for which no support is given. In fact, several premises back up the statement. \n\nAnswer choice (B): This is the correct answer. The statement in question is a sub-conclusion, described in this answer as a subsidiary conclusion. \n\nAnswer choice (C): The phrase in question is in agreement with the argument, and does not reference a possible objection. If you were to choose this answer, you would have to ask yourself, “What is the possible objection mentioned in this answer choice?” \n\nAnswer choice (D): The argument as a whole works towards supporting the recommendation that “pedigree organizations should set standards requiring working ability in pedigreed dogs classified as working dogs.” The phrase in the question stem does not summarize the antithesis of that position. \n\nAnswer choice (E): This answer has the order of the argument backwards. The phrase referenced in the question stem provides evidence necessary to support a claim stated later in the argument.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

Some groups in the United States blame free trade for leading to the loss of manufacturing jobs, while others blame it for exposing some U.S. producers to foreign competition. Free trade, however, is good for America, and for a very simple reason: it allows American workers to specialize in goods and services that they produce more efficiently than workers in the rest of the world and then to exchange them for goods and services that workers from other countries produce at higher quality and lower cost. Specialization and free trade allow the U.S. to become more competitive and innovative.

The conclusion is that \"[the reasoning of the bank's depositor's] might well be overoptimistic.\" Now let's breakdown the argument (again, ignore the BF for now):\n\n - The depositors took this as evidence that the execs had faith in the bank's financial soundness. According to the author, this evidence does NOT necessarily support the depositors' belief.\n2)  - In other words, \",\" the author questions the depositors' logic. The 2nd boldfaced portion is the reason why the author questions their logicThe  believe that the first BF portion is evidence that the execs had faith in the bank's financial soundness. Thus, the first describes evidence that has been taken as supporting the conclusion . The first half looks good.\n\nThe second BF portion explains WHY the author questions the depositors' logic. The 2nd includes an alternative explanation for the execs actions. So perhaps those actions do NOT support the conclusion of the depositors. Thus, the 2nd gives a reason for questioning whether the 1st actually supports the depositors' conclusion. (A) looks good.\n\nAs described for (A), the first part looks good. But the second part is not the author's conclusion. The author's conclusion (the contrary conclusion) is that \"[the reasoning of the bank's depositor's] might well be overoptimistic.\" The second BF portion  the author's conclusion, but it is not the conclusion itself.

Eliminate (C).\n\nThe author does not claim that the execs are buying shares  \"corporate executives have been known to buy shares in their own company in a calculated attempt to dispel negative rumors about the company's health.\" In other words, the 2nd portion is not presented as an explanation itself. Instead, it is the reason the author questions the depositors' explanation.\n\nAlso, the author's goal is not to explain why the execs are buying shares. The author does not pretend to know the motives behind the execs actions. All the author wants to show is that the depositors' reasoning  be wrong.

(Cause and effect relationship between the increase in promotion by physicians and the decrease in fee for patients)\n\n Recent changes in regulations of such promotions have lifted the requirement that the amount charged for a consultation appear on the promotion.\n\nConclusion (Social workers opinion): An effect of this change will be that physicians will no longer be inclined to reduce their fees when they start to promote, and   (This bold faced portion is social workers opinion) \n\nHere the second bold face portion suggest that social worker believes that \"Intermediate conclusion (Bold Face 01)\" will not hold true due to \"Premise 02\"\n\nBased on this analysis answer should be C. \n\nHope it helps!\n\n\n</span>",

This clue doesn’t always exist but it is usually there. The question stem also signals the type by asking for the role played by the two portions in boldface.\n\n\nAll right, this is a Role question. The argument will contain a conclusion, and the boldface portions will relate to the conclusion in one of three broad ways:\n\nThe boldface text could be the conclusion.\nThe boldface text could support the conclusion.\nThe boldface text could be anything else (including neutral background), though most commonly it will be either  counter-premise or a counter-conclusion.\n\nHere’s what I thought and wrote while I did the problem. Your own thought process won’t be exactly the same as mine and, of course, your notes will probably look quite different, since we all have our own ways of abbreviating things. (Note: R = Describe the Role)\n\n\nThis is a Role question, so I have to figure out what roles the two boldface statements play.\n\nThe first one does NOT go along with the CA’s argument, so it must be category 3. The information is interesting: the CA acknowledges that it is generally true, but just doesn’t think that it applies to one specific circumstance.\n\nThe second boldface supports the CA’s conclusion.\n\n\n\nNote that the language of the answer choices is very confusing. Try to keep the three main categories in mind: (1) it IS the conclusion, (2) it SUPPORTS the conclusion, (3) it’s anything other than 1 or 2. That classification will make it easier to get rid of some answer choices, even if you don’t fully follow the convoluted language.\n\n\n(1) The question stem will usually include the word role and will almost always (but not always!) include bold font in the argument.\n\n(2) Once you realize you have a Role question, classify the boldface font into one of the three categories discussed above.\n\n(3) If you struggle to understand what a choice says, ask yourself whether the language most likely goes with category 1, 2, or 3. That might be enough to help you eliminate the answer.\n\n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t | \n\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n\n |  |  |  |  |  |",

        "question": "My encyclopedia says that the mathematician Pierre de Fermat died in 1665 without leaving behind any written proof for a theorem that he claimed nonetheless to have proved. Probably this alleged theorem simply cannot be proved, since---as the article points out---no one else has been able to prove it. Therefore it is likely that Fermat was either lying or else mistaken when he made his claim. \n\n Your encyclopedia is out of date. Recently someone has in fact proved Fermat’s theorem. And since the theorem is provable, your claim---that Fermat was lying or mistaken---clearly is wrong. \n\nWhich one of the following most accurately describes a reasoning error in Laura’s argument? \n",

Thus, even if the theorem was known to be provable, Fermat may still have been lying or mistaken. Something that  that Fermat was not lying or mistaken would show that Fermat himself proved the theorem, not just that the theorem is provable.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "There is a great deal of geographical variation in the frequency of many surgical procedures—up to tenfold variation per hundred thousand between different areas in the numbers of hysterectomies, prostatectomies, and tonsillectomies.\n\nTo support a conclusion that much of the variation is due to unnecessary surgical procedure, it would be most important to establish which of the following?\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "We are told that there is a great deal of geographical variation in the frequency of many surgical procedures. Now we need to support the conclusion that much of that variation is due to unnecessary surgical procedure.\n\nSo we are given some facts and a conclusion, and we need to select the statement that, if established, would make our argument the strongest. In other words, we are trying to complete the argument with information that would most support the conclusion.\n\nLet's review what we have so far:\n\n(A) is tempting because this  lead to evidence that would support our conclusion. But whether (A) hurts or helps our argument depends on what those local review boards actually find. Perhaps they'll find that, in the areas with high numbers of surgical procedures, many of the procedures were actually unnecessary. That would obviously strengthen our conclusion.\n\nBut we can't assume that the boards' results will help our argument. Perhaps the data from the review boards will actually contradict our conclusion. Or perhaps the review boards themselves will have local biases (i.e. different opinions about what constitutes a \"necessary\" surgery).\n\nChoice (A) MIGHT lead to results that strengthen our conclusion. But, without further information, we can't be sure. We can hang on to this one for now, but (A) is not looking great.\n\nThis one's much better. If the variation is actually due to factors that influence the INCIDENCE of diseases that might require surgery, then we would have an explanation that contradicts our conclusion. For example, perhaps people living along the coast are, for some reason, more susceptible to tonsillitis and thus are more likely to require tonsillectomies. This would indeed explain a geographical variation in tonsillectomies and would weaken our conclusion.\n\nIf choice (B) is established, then we can eliminate this alternate explanation. That would directly strengthen our argument, so (B) looks good.\n\nSimply knowing that different types of procedures are often performed unnecessarily does not support our conclusion. Do unnecessary surgical procedures explain the geographical variations described in the passage? Choice (C) doesn't support this theory, so eliminate (C).\n\nThis statement suggests that it is difficult to distinguish between necessary and unnecessary procedures. This, in turn, suggests that it would be difficult to actually test our theory. If we can't confidently determine that some surgeries were unnecessary, how can we show that unnecessary surgeries explain the geographical variations?\n\nChoice (D) suggests that our theory might be difficult to study, and it certainly does not support our conclusion. Eliminate (D).\n\nSay we have an area that performed ten times as many hysterectomies, prostatectomies, and tonsillectomies as another area. According to our theory, many of the surgeries in the first area were probably unnecessary. This would explain the variation. If we can show that many of the surgeries in the first area were in fact unnecessary, then our theory would look pretty good.\n\nThat would NOT necessarily mean that, in general, unnecessary surgical procedures are performed about as frequently as unnecessary hysterectomies, prostatectomies, and tonsillectomies. Maybe, for some reason, unnecessary hysterectomies, prostatectomies, and tonsillectomies are performed much more often than other unnecessary surgeries.\n\nIf we can show that hysterectomies, prostatectomies, and tonsillectomies were performed unnecessarily in areas with high frequencies of such operations, then we've demonstrated that our theory is valid. It doesn't matter whether these trends apply to surgical procedures . Eliminate (E).\n\n(B) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

Recently a service attempted to validate its rankings by assigning star ratings to players upon completion of their careers to determine the accuracy of the initial rankings. The survey averaged the post-career ratings of each player and found that 5-star players’ final average was 4.46, compared with 3.98 for 4-stars and 3.11 for 3-stars. This suggests that the rankings services do not effectively judge high-end talent as well as they judge players in the middle of the range.\n\nWhich of the following identifies a problem with the service’s attempt to validate its rankings?\n",

        "explanation": "This problem demonstrates a type of data flaw that you might not expect – which is exactly what the author of a hard question wants, for you to accept a faulty conclusion because you did not critically examine the data. What’s the flaw here? In a five-point scale, a predicted ‘4’ has multiple outcomes: a 5 (exceeding expectations and bringing the group average up), a 4 (meeting expectations, keeping the average the same), or a 3 or below (underperforming the prediction, bringing the average down). But a predicted ‘5’ can only live up to expectations – it cannot exceed them. Anything other than a 5 brings the expected average down. So while the experts’ misevaluations of a 4-star prospect might be balanced out by some 5s to counter 3s, their evaluations of a 5-star prospect all count in the same downward direction. Choice B exposes this flaw – the experts may have missed just as often with 3 and 4 star players, but because they could miss on either side of the predicted value the average is close to what they predicted.For your study, this is important – especially with the Integrated Reasoning section included, the GMAT will feature plenty of problems in which statistics are used improperly, to draw invalid conclusions.

You will most likely have to put in the correct conclusion or else (as here) a correct piece of evidence that would logically support the conclusion. As with other inference questions, the best approach is to follow the gist of the passage, make a deduction and scan for a match. \n\nHere, the author is arguing that the scan will obviate the need for surgeons to perform unnecessary appendectomies. Really? Let's examine what we have learned about the scan: the misdiagnosis rate is 2%. But are the misdiagnoses false positives or false negatives? A false positive is where the scan says you have appendictis when you don't while a false negative is when the scan fails to pick up that a patient has appendictis when in fact they do. False positives are not risky here b/c if a person who doesn't have appendictis gets his/her appendix removed, its no big deal. On the other hand, false negatives are very risky b/c if a person who has appendicitis doesn't get his/her appendix removed, then they may die. So, in order for the author's conclusion to be correct, the kind of misdiagnoses the scan makes must be false positives and not false negatives.

It is definitely still possible to have them not be as great as the environmentalists think, but still be greater than the current system.\n\nAnswer A is right for that very reason. It will have worse consequences than the proponents believe, because the proponents believe it will have ZERO consequences. That's why A is right.\n\nThis may sound a little fuzzy, but I'll give you the advice that helped me on the LSAT (which I think offers much tougher CR questions than the GMAT). When I was doing the LSAT, I kept missing stupid CR questions until I realized one very important fact. There are no varying degrees of how \"good\" an answer is on the CR portion. One answer is RIGHT and the other four are WRONG. If you go through the 5 choices and think that two or more \"could\" be right, then something is wrong. It means that you are missing a key nuance somewhere. Either in the prompt, the question, or the answer choice. When that happens, I usually start by rereading the choices I'm debating between. After that I reread the question, then I reread the prompt (assuming that you haven't spotted the issue along the way). I give that order because I've found that for me personally, it breaks down like this. When I'm in that situation, about 60% of the time my error was in missing a nuance in the choices i'm debating between. About 30% of the time the error is in reading the other choices. And then about 10% of the time it's from the question or the prompt.\n\nWhenever I've tutored people I've told them that this is the single most valuable piece of information I ever figured out. It allowed me to go from consistently making stupid errors, to literally never missing a single CR question. It'll take some time to figure it out, but I encourage you to try it. When you do figure it out you'll feel a million times more confident on CR questions.",

On the other hand, this choice indicates that people would simply , on average, regardless of what type of house they have.\n\nAfter all, if this choice is true, then, on average, people would likely spend less in winter and summer to heat and cool their houses respectively than was spent to heat and cool the houses in the survey. After all, given what this choice says, average outdoor temperatures are less extreme than the outdoor temperatures in the region where the houses in the survey were located, and it costs less to heat and cool a house when outdoor temperatures are less extreme.\n\nAt the same time, the differences in temperature mentioned by this choice would not cause people who have concrete houses to save more. Spending less because of less extreme outdoor temperatures is not the same as saving because of having a concrete house. In fact, being in a region where outdoor temperatures are less extreme would allow people who have wooden houses to spend less as well.\n\nEliminate.\n\n \n\nIf antyhing, this choice casts doubt on, rather than supports the conclusion.\n\nAfter all, if this choice is true, then the houses in the survey are similar to average houses. The fact that they are similar in this way indicates that the savings achieved by people in average houses would be about the same as, rather than greater than, the savings achieved in the case of the concrete house in the survey.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is interesting.\n\nIf this choice is true, then the wooden house in the survey was better insulated than the average wooden house. Of course, in that case, having that concrete house rather than the wooden house in the survey resulted in less-than-average savings because the difference between the insulating properties of the concrete and the wood in those houses was less than average.\n\nSo, if this choice is true, the average person would save more than was saved in the case of the survey houses by having a concrete house rather than a wooden house because, normally, the difference between wood and concrete is greater.\n\nSo, this choice supports the conclusion.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThis choice would support the conclusion if the passage said that the concrete house in the survey had relatively thin walls. After all, in that case, people whose houses have average, rather than relatively thin, concrete walls would save even more by having concrete walls rather than wooden walls.\n\nAt the same time, the passage doesn't say that the house in the survey had relatively thin concrete walls. So, for all we know, it had average concrete walls. In that case, the fact that relatively thin concrete walls provide only slightly greater energy efficiency than wooden walls is irrelevant. After all, in that case, there's no reason to believe that the average house with concrete walls has thicker walls than the concrete house in the survey.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe conclusion that the correct answer must support is about energy costs, not maintenance costs or total costs. So, because maintenance costs have no clear effect on energy costs, this information about maintenance costs has no bearing on the conclusion.\n\nEliminate.\n\n C­",

A false negative result indicates that a person is not allergic to the food when, in fact, they are. To most accurately determine food allergies, a physician should use the test that gives the smallest percentage of false negative results because ______________________.\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "This question illustrates a couple of critical concepts for Critical Reasoning. First it introduces you to the \"Best Completes the Passage\" format, in which you need to infer the question stem from the language immediately preceding the underlined portion-to-be-completed. Here that word is \"because\", which seeks evidence for a conclusion. And that conclusion is \"in order to most accurately determine food allergies, doctors should use the test with the smallest percentage of false negatives\". The goal in this question is clearly to strengthen that conclusion.\n\nWith this in mind, you are now set up for another common trap- one in which the author of the question knows where your mind wants to go, and baits you in that direction. When you think of an allergy (or really any medical) diagnosis, what is your biggest fear? Probably that the doctor will miss a diagnosis and allow you to continue with a risky behavior that could negatively affect your quality of life. Say, for example, that you are allergic to peanuts, but your doctor falsely (false negative) says that you're not. Your next peanut butter sandwich could be catastrophic! On the flip side, if the doctor tells you that you are allergic to peanuts when it turns out you're not, that's more of an inconvenience than anything. It's a bummer to not enjoy Reese's peanut butter cups, but it's not life-threatening. \n\nSo, naturally, your mind wants to minimize false negatives, to err on the side of safety. But what's the conclusion? To most accurately (not most safely!) determine allergies, you should eliminate false negatives. For this specific objective, false positives are just as detrimental as false negatives – each is inaccurate. And so the correct answer needs to give you some reason why you are only focusing on false negatives if the goal is accuracy. Choice E, which does not bear on safety (but neither does the conclusion) is correct, as it shows that false positives will be the same for each test, so the only way to become more accurate is to minimize false negatives.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n- What Are My Chances - Automated Profile Evaluation Tool is Here",

Reviewing the passage, we see that the phenomenon discussed is that \"More and more people are being diagnosed with thyroid cancer,\" which many doctors believe to be \"due to unnecessary testing that finds small tumors that do not lead to complications.\"\n\nSo, we need to find the choice that explains why overtesting is not the culprit in, i.e., the cause of, the increase in the number of people being diagnosed with thyroid cancer.\n\n\n\nWe might get the impression that this choice provides an alternative explanation for the  increase in the number of people being diagnosed with thyroid cancer and thus explains why overtesting is not the cause of that increase.\n\nNotice, however, that this choice states a fact that has been true in both the past and the present. In other words, it's not new that exposure to certain chemicals appears to be associated with thyroid cancer.\n\nSomething that has been true in both the past and the present would not explain the increase in the number of people being diagnosed with thyroid cancer that is occurring in the present. In other words, something that has remained the same would not explain a change.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe fact that patients usually do not have symptoms unless the cancer is at an advanced stage would not explain the increase in diagnoses. After all, the fact that people do NOT have symptoms would not cause them to be diagnosed with the illness.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe fact that the accuracy of the tests has not increased eliminates an alternative cause for the increase in the number of people being diagnosed with thyroid cancer. After all, if the accuracy of the tests had increased, then that increase in accuracy, rather than overtesting, could explain the increase in the number of diagnoses.\n\nSo, rather than explain why overtesting is not the cause, this choice provides an additional reason to believe that overtesting IS the cause.\n\nThus, this choice does the opposite of what we need.\n\nEliminate.\n \n\n\nThe survival rate of thyroid cancer would not affect the rate of diagnosis of thyroid cancer. So, this choice has no effect on the validity of the statement \"overtesting is not really the culprit (in the increase in the number of diagnoses of thyroid cancer).\"\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice provides an alternative cause of the increase in the number of people being diagnosed with thyroid cancer: the number of thyroid tumors is increasing. After all, the fact that the number of tumors is increasing would certainly explain the increase in the number of people being diagnosed with thyroid cancer.\n\nBy providing an alternative cause, this choice indicates why overtesting is not really the cause of the increase in the number of people being diagnosed with thyroid cancer.\n\nKeep.\n\nThe correct answer is (E).",

However, it also lowers the nutritional value of many foods. For example, irradiation destroys a significant percentage of whatever vitamin B1 a food may contain. Proponents of irradiation point out that irradiation is no worse in this respect than cooking. However, this fact is either beside the point, since much irradiated food is eaten raw, or else misleading, since ___________.\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "Proponents of irradiation point out that irradiation is no worse than cooking when it comes to lowering the nutritional value of food. However, the author concludes that this fact is either beside the point or misleading.\n\nThe author explains that this fact can be beside the point since much irradiated food is eaten raw. Take raw vegetables for example:\n\nChoice (A) explains why the proponents might be motivated to defend irradiation. This might explain why the proponents would make a misleading statement, but it does not explain why the statement is in fact misleading. Eliminate (A).\n\nWe need to specifically address the claim that irradiation is no worse than cooking when it comes to lowering the nutritional value of food. Choice (B)  suggest that irradiation could have other adverse effects. Regardless, we need to show how the proponents' claim is misleading. Choice (B) does not help and can be eliminated.\n\nThis additional information about cooking and irradiation does not explain why the proponents' claim is misleading. Eliminate (C).\n\nThis fact is already implied in the passage: \"Proponents of irradiation point out that irradiation is  in this respect than cooking.\" The author does not dispute that cooking can be worse. In fact, the author's wording suggests that cooking usually is worse. Choice (D) simply strengthens the point made by the proponents, and that's not what we are looking for. We need something that explains why the proponents' claim is misleading. Eliminate (D).\n\nRemember the first bullet point above: \"Proponents of irradiation point out that irradiation is no worse in this respect than cooking.\" So if irradiating your food lowers the nutritional value by some amount and cooking your food lowers the nutritional value by approximately the same amount, why worry about irradiation? If you are going to cook your food, you are going to lower the nutritional value by that amount anyway, so don't worry about the effect of irradiation.\n\nBut what if each process INDEPENDENTLY lowers the nutritional value by that amount? In other words, if irradiating your food lowers the nutritional value by some amount, a proponent might say, \"Well, cooking the food would have lowered the nutrition by that amount anyway, so who cares?\" But what if cooking that irradiated food FURTHER lowers the nutritional value? Now you have lost TWICE as much nutrition as you would have with only one of those processes.\n\nIf each process could only lower the nutritional value to some level but not any further, then the proponents' argument would hold. For example, if we've already lowered the nutrition with irradiation, perhaps cooking won't lower it any further. Choice (E) tells us that this is not the case. If we've already lowered the nutritional value with irradiation, cooking will STILL lower the nutritional value even further (by approximately the same amount). Thus, we have compounded the problem, and, from a nutritional perspective, we would have been better off without irradiation.\n\nChoice (E) explains how the proponents claim can be misleading, so it is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

Higher profit margins would lead to more ranching entrepreneurs entering the market, which would in turn mean more tax funding for a water treatment facility that purifies contaminated water. Therefore, eliminating the requirement that ranchers fence their land would ultimately lead to cleaner water supplies. This argument cannot be true unless .\n\n",

A newly developed internal scan for appendicitis is highly accurate, producing two misdiagnoses for every 98 correct diagnoses.

You will most likely have to put in the correct conclusion or else (as here) a correct piece of evidence that would logically support the conclusion. As with other inference questions, the best approach is to follow the gist of the passage, make a deduction and scan for a match. \n\nHere, the author is arguing that the scan will obviate the need for surgeons to perform unnecessary appendectomies. Really? Let's examine what we have learned about the scan: the misdiagnosis rate is 2%. But are the misdiagnoses false positives or false negatives? A false positive is where the scan says you have appendictis when you don't while a false negative is when the scan fails to pick up that a patient has appendictis when in fact they do. False positives are not risky here b/c if a person who doesn't have appendictis gets his/her appendix removed, its no big deal. On the other hand, false negatives are very risky b/c if a person who has appendicitis doesn't get his/her appendix removed, then they may die. So, in order for the author's conclusion to be correct, the kind of misdiagnoses the scan makes must be false positives and not false negatives. That would be the piece of evidence that would support the conclusion (we know we want to put in some evidence here b/c the passage ends with \"since'). That is our deduction, and now we scan for a match....choice B.\"\n\n-&gt; I think the statement we need to fill is a piece of information that will guarantee that they will perform \"ALL THE NECESSARY\" operations, in this case even when is a misdiagnoses.

Judging by the popularity of microwave popcorn, many people are willing to pay a high price for just a little additional convenience.\n\nIf the statements in the passage are true, which one of the following must also be true?\n",

        "explanation": "Premises:\n\n75 brands of microwave popcorn account for a little over half of the money from sales of microwave food products. \nMicrowave popcorn takes 3 minutes while conventional takes 7 minutes. \nMicrowave popcorn costs over five times as much as conventional popcorn. \n\nConclusion: Many people are willing to pay a high price for just a little additional convenience.\n\nWe are looking for an inference fro the passage. So the option should have no new information.\n\n(A) No single brand of microwave popcorn accounts for a large share of microwave food product sales.\nWe know there are 75 brands but that doesn't mean that market share is split equally among them. Once brand may have a good 20% chunk or so. A single brand may account for a large share. Note that we don't know what a 'large' share is either. Hence, this is very subjective. It is certainly not our inference.\n\n(B) There are more brands of microwave popcorn on the market than there are of any other microwave food product.\nWe are not given whether any other food product has more brands. It is possible that say, there are 100 brands of ready to cook meals but they all account for only 20% of the sales from microwave food products.\n\n(C) By volume, more microwave popcorn is sold than is conventional popcorn.\nWe do not know this. We know that microwave popcorn is popular but whether more microwave popcorn is sold or conventional popcorn, we are not given.\n\n(D) More money is spent on microwave food products that take three minutes or less to cook than on microwave food products that take longer to cook.\nMicrowave popcorn takes 3 mins to cook and accounts for more than half the sales of microwave food products. So more than half the money spent on microwave food products is spent on microwave popcorn which takes 3 mins to cook. Hence, we can conclude that more money is spent on microwave food products that take three minutes or less to cook than on microwave food products that take longer to cook. Correct. \n\n(E) Of the total number of microwave food products on the market, most are microwave popcorn products.\nWe know that sales of microwave popcorn accounts for more than half but do we know whether microwave popcorn products account for most of the microwave food products on the market?

Thus, the passage does not support this statement about “more people.” After all, while the proportion of people living in rural areas may decrease, we don’t have information indicating that “more people”  will live in urban areas. Rather, for all we know, the number of people living in all areas will decrease.\n\n\n\nWe have information on only the relative likelihoods of people developing schizophrenia in rural and urban rural areas. So, we don’t have support for this statement about  people being “generally healthier.”\n\n\n\nIf “the proportion of people living in rural areas will drop over the next ten years,” then the proportion of people living in urban areas will increase.

        "question": "­Economist: In the middle of the twentieth century, continuous technological innovation mitigated the effects of an economic recession in the United States. But since that time, such innovation has increasingly been done by small companies funded by profit-minded venture capitalists, and that venture-capital funding—which has become critical to economic vitality—plunges when the economy enters a recession. After the 1987 stock market crash, for example, venture capital fell by more than 50 percent, from $5.2 billion in 1987 to $2.5 billion in 1991. \n\nThe economist’s statements above can best serve as part of an argument for which of the following hypotheses?\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "­\n\n\n\nWe see that the passage is made up of factual statements about the effects of technological innovation being funded by venture capitalists.\n\n\n\nIf statements \"serve as part of an argument\" for a hypothesis, they support the hypothesis.\n\nSo, this question is a Conclusion question, and the correct answer will be a conclusion supported by the passage.\n\n\n\nRegarding \"the 1987 stock market crash,\" the passage says the following:\n\n\n\nWe see that, unlike what this choice says, the passage says that the crash caused a decrease in venture capital, rather than that venture capitalists caused the crash.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is pretty tricky. In fact, I initially thought it might be correct, but here's what's going on.\n\nThis choice may seem to be supported by the passage since the passage says the following:\n\n\n\nSeeing that contrast between what occurred \"in the middle of the twentieth century\" and what has occurred \"since that time\" with innovation increasingly \"done by small companies funded by ... venture capitalists,\" we could get the impression that this choice is correct.\n\nAt the same time, we have to notice some key things in the passage.\n\nThe first thing we have to notice is that it says, \"In the middle of the twentieth century, continuous technological innovation  the effects of an economic recession.\" Something that \"mitigated the effects\" of a recession didn't prevent a recession from occurring. Mitigating something is making it less problematic than it would have been, not preventing it.\n\nThe second is that the passage says, \"venture-capital funding—which has become critical to economic vitality—plunges when the economy enters a recession.\" Notice that this issue doesn't arise unless the economy \"enters a recession.\" So, the issue is not that venture-capital funding causes recessions. The issue is that venture capital funding plunges when a recession occurs.\n\nSimply put, the passage doesn't say that what occurred in the middle of the twentieth century prevented recessions or that venture capital causes recessions to be more likely.\n\nThus, nothing the passage says indicates that \"The likelihood of an economic recession in the U.S. increased after the middle of the twentieth century due to a shift toward venture-capital funding.\"\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nNotice that the passage doesn't say that recessions are worse because there's too much venture-capital funding during a recession. It indicates that recessions are worse because \"venture-capital funding ... plunges when the economy enters a recession.\" In other words, the issue is that there's less venture-capital funding during a recession.\n\nSo, the passage indicates that, contrary to what this choice says, putting limits on venture-capital funding during a recession wouldn't help at all. It could even make things worse.\n\nElimimate.\n\n\n\nWe might be tempted to eliminate this choice because it doesn't mention \"venture-capital funding.\"\n\nNotice, however, that \"The method used after the mid-twentieth century for funding U.S. technological innovations\" mentioned by this choice matches perfectly with \"venture-capital funding\" in the passage. After all, the passage says, \"since that time, such innovation has increasingly been done by small companies funded by profit-minded venture capitalists.\"\n\nSo, we can presume that \"the method\" mentioned in this choice is \"venture-capital.\"\n\nSo, does the passage support the idea that venture capital \"can intensify the severity of a recession\"? Yes it does. After all it says the following:\n\n since that time, such innovation has increasingly been done by small companies funded by profit-minded venture capitalists.\n\nThis choice may seem correct because, according to the passage, there has been a change in the relationship between innovation and the economy. That change is that, in the middle of the twentieth century, innovation mitigated the effects of a recession, but now it doesn't.\n\nAt the same time, this choice is not supported by the passage and even in a way is contrary to what the passage implies. After all, the fact that innovation no longer mitigates recessions the way it did doesn't mean it's less important. In fact, what the passage says suggests that innovation is still important and therefore could still mitigate recessions but doesn't because of how it's funded.\n\nEliminate.\n\n D­",

Participants strongly preferred Treatment A over Treatment B and both Treatment A and Treatment B over Treatment C.\n \nThe above study results most strongly support which of the following conclusions?\n        \n  ",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Note that Treatments A and C are, in fact, quite identical in their effects – though those effects are expressed a bit differently. Each of these two treatments results in 6,000 individuals living and 2,000 individuals dying. So any preference that study participants expressed between the two treatments could not be based only on the effectiveness of those treatments. Whatever else the participants may have considered – perhaps the disparate framing of the statements had its own impact – it is fair to conclude that Answer E must be true.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because in fact the two treatments with the most certainty, Treatment A and Treatment C, received opposite preferences from the study participants. Treatment A was most favored, whereas Treatment C was least favored. The treatment that generated more uncertainty, Treatment B, received the middle preference. \n\nAlternatively, if the “uncertainty” is understood as a question of which people would die, then Treatments A and C generate more uncertainty but again are placed at opposite ends of the preference spectrum. Either way, avoidance of uncertainty does not seem to explain these results.\n\nAnswer B again fails to appreciate that Treatments A and C save the same number of lives, and, in fact, Treatment B, on average, saves the exact same number of lives as well. Though it is almost certainly true in real life, there is no basis within this argument to conclude that study participants favored saving more lives.\n\nAnswer C is plausible, since study participants treated functionally identical treatments – Treatment A and Treatment C – so differently, but this explanation is not certain. Perhaps the instructions did not confuse participants but the treatment descriptions did. Perhaps participants fully understood the treatment descriptions but were biased by the way in which those descriptions were framed. Answer C is not a “must be true” answer and is not, therefore, a correct inference.\n\nAnswer D speculates about a new treatment that the study simply gives us no basis to evaluate with certainty. In fact, a close reading reveals that Treatment D is logically identical to Treatment B. Perhaps its different framing would produce a different preference, or perhaps not. If it did produce a different preference, perhaps that preference would be higher or perhaps it would be lower. Certainty is rarely forthcoming on a hypothetical such as this, and we may conclude, for this reason, that Answer D is incorrect.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

Out of consideration for others, people who have these antitheft alarms on their cars should deactivate them when they park in crowded city neighborhoods at night.\n\nWhich one of the following, if assumed by the author of the passage, would allow her properly to draw her conclusion that the owners of alarm-equipped cars should deactivate the alarms when parking in crowded city neighborhoods at night?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Let's analyze the argument.\n\nThe author of this argument recommends that people who have antitheft alarms on their cars should deactivate them when they park in crowded city neighborhoods at night. To appropriately get the right assumption, we need to understand why the feels that the antitheft alarms should be deactivated. Clearly, the author is more concerned about the disturbance that these alarms cause in the neighborhood than the theft of the car. Why do I think so? Look at the first premise, the author actually implies that the sound of an alarm on a car does not necessarily mean that the thief would be deterred. An alarm may [or may not] stop an attempted car theft. So, kind of sarcastically, the author is asking, why then do you even leave the alarms on in the first place? Apart from this possibility that when the alarm genuinely goes off as a result of a genuine attempt of car theft, where the alarm might not even ward off the thief, these alarms are subject to many false alarms. The alarm can go off falsely through a harmless contact, a tree branch touching the car, or an internal fault within the alarm system. The author simply has had enough of the disturbance. So clearly, he/she ranks the nuisance of alarms in the night as worse than the theft of the car. He/she values the peace in the neighborhood. Based on the aforementioned, what could possibly be an assumption of this argument?\n\nThis option actually weakens the argument. Hence incorrect. If this is true, then the author may have to reconsider his/her argument again.\n\nThis is close, but as per the reasoning above, this argument cares little about whether an alarm is false or not. So this cannot be an assumption of the argument above. If the argument had probably shown some concern about the theft of the car and suggested that alarms that genuinely sound at night due to an attempt to steal the car are tolerable, then this would suffice as the assumption. At best, B is a strengthener. Most means more than 50% of the time. The opposite of most is not more than 50% of the time, meaning we can have 49.9% of the time that car alarms sound is false. What difference does this make to the argument? Very little. C is a much better assumption for this argument.\n\nThis is exactly what the author is concerned about. This is the last piece of the puzzle needed to make the argument above airtight. Because if allowing residents of a crowded city neighborhood to sleep undisturbed is not more important than preventing car theft, the argument above will fall apart. So this must be the necessary assumption of this argument.\n\nD is tricky but focus on the meaning. Generally means most of the time, more than 50% of the time. So negating this means not more than 50% of the time. So the question is what difference does it make for people are not inconsiderate of others 49.9% of the time compared to say when they are inconsiderate to others 50.1% of the time. The truth is we are not trying to strengthen the argument, but we are interested in an assumption. A statement that makes the argument above airtight. D, like B, is a potential strengthener of the argument, but not necessarily an assumption. One has to be mindful of these modifying words when dealing with assumptions. Compared to C, D does not stand a chance since C does a much better job by clearly stating that .\n\nCompletely irrelevant to the argument above.\n\n</a> this is what I think about the argument above. I hope it is somehow helpful.",

How about we have a look?\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t. I boxed just the beginning of those lines because the frame is all that matters. Believe it or not, we do not care about the details of what others believe or worry about. The question asks about the  of the industrial engineer, so until the engineer might offer an opinion on these views, we can more or less ignore them. The next line, however, does just that. Note the strong, judgmental language: , not the conclusion itself. All we need to do now is play a matching game with the answer choices.\n\n(A) and (E), the most popular incorrect answers, fail for the same reason. The engineer is not interested in offering suggestions to fix global warming.  That has nothing to do with the conclusion, which merely criticizes a view. Just because someone offers a contrary opinion, you cannot assume that a counterproposal is in place.\n\n(B) restates one of the views from earlier in the passage, but that does not make it a conclusion. In fact, if I  you that someone has concluded something, you can only consider that information a statement, one about the conclusion of someone else.

For this reason, many early discussions of global warming predicted that it would cause more frequent and intense tropical storms. But recent research shows that this prediction is unlikely to be borne out. Other factors, such as instabilities in wind flow, are likely to counteract global warming’s effects on tropical storm development.\n\nWhich one of the following most accurately expresses the conclusion drawn in the geographer’s argument?\n",

These temperatures are caused by Global Warming. \nAs a result, more and more people are talking about this and predicting that Global Warming would cause a higher number of heavy storms.

Because there are other factors that affect Global Warming (Instabilities of the wind, etc.)  \n\nThe Question asks us to show what Expresses (Explains) the Conclusion (The effects are unlikely)\n\n(A) Tropical storms are especially likely to form over warm ocean surfaces. . Repeats/Re-words one of the premises. \n\n(B) Contrary to early discussions, global warming is not the only factor affecting the frequency and intensity of tropical storms. . Tempting, but wrong because the other factors mentioned, according to the passage determine Global Warming. Can't link these to the occurrences and depths of the storms. \n\n(C) If global warming were reversed, tropical storms would be less frequent and less intense.  In line with the reasoning, but doesn't restate the conclusion. If you selected this, you likely didn't pay attention to the conclusion.\n\n(D) Instabilities in wind flow will negate the effect of global warming on the formation of tropical storms.  Too strong a choice to say that these factors will completely rule out the effect of Global Warming on Tropical Storms. All We know is that they affect Global Warming in some way.\n\n(E) Global warming probably will not produce more frequent and intense tropical storms.  </span>.

Hence, the conclusion is supported by A no matter what. \n\n -  If there is no feasible way, the conclusion obviously holds true.

If the answer is yes, however, the conclusion suddenly falls apart. Hence, , i.e. evaluate the conclusion. Hence, this option is .\n\n - Whether the free market has a detrimental effect or not is irrelevant to this argument. We are trying to evaluate whether it is important for the government to play a role, not the market itself. \n\n - This is super irrelevant. Whether countries adopt an approach or not tells us nothing about whether that approach is good/necessary. In addition, this option isn't even looking at the relevant approach discussed in the conclusion. \n\nOne of the key takeaways here is that for any assumption related questions (Find the assumption, Strengthen/Weaken the argument, Evaluate the argument), the first key obstacle you have to overcome is to correctly identify the claim being made in the conclusion.\n\n - Matoo\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "In a ten-year study, one group of volunteers was given a medical screening for disease X every year, whereas an otherwise similar group of the same size was only screened for disease X at the end of the study. Nine percent of the first group were diagnosed with disease X during the study and received treatment, but only six percent of the second group were diagnosed with disease X when they received the screening at the end of the study. The researchers concluded that during the ten-year period, disease X must have disappeared without medical treatment in some individuals in the second group.\n\nIn order to evaluate the strength of the researcher's reasoning, it would be most helpful to know which of the following?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Here's my take:\n\n\n\nThe researchers' conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nThe researchers' reasoning is essentially the following:\n\nSince nine percent of the volunteers in the screened group were diagnosed with disease X during the ten-year period of the study, it stands to reason that around nine percent of the group that was screened only at the end of the study also experienced disease X during the ten-year period of the study. Thus, the reason why only six percent of the volunteers in the second group were diagnosed with disease X at the end of the study must be that disease X did appear in some other individuals in the second group but disappeared without treatment.\n\nThe correct answer will help with evaluating whether the conclusion follows from the researchers' reasoning.\n\n\n\nThis choice uses the term \"statistically significant\" to seem important, but we can shorten this choice to \"whether there were ... lifestyle differences between the individuals who were diagnosed with disease X and those who were not.\"\n\nNow, what we need to notice to see why the answer to the question posed by this choice doesn't affect the argument is the following. This choice about differences between people diagnosed with disease X and people not diagnosed with disease X whereas the argument is about a difference between the rates of diagnosis in two groups of people, in each of which some members were diagnosed with disease X and others were not.\n\nPut simply, this choice and the argument are about two different differences. So, regardless of what the answer to this question is, that answer doesn't affect the argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nRegardless of how many people volunteered for or participated in the study because they had an especially high risk for disease X, that information would not give us any insight into why there was a difference between the percentages of the volunteers in the two groups who experienced disease X. After all, that information would not indicate that there was any difference between the risks for disease X of the members of the two groups.\n\nIn fact, the passage tells us that, other than in the way the volunteers in the two groups were screened for disease X, the two groups were \"similar.\" So, presumably, the risk for disease X of the volunteers in the two groups was, on average, similar.\n\nSo, the information mentioned by this choice would help us to understand only the risk for disease X of all the volunteers in the two groups, not any difference between the two groups.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nInformation on how long it takes to be  for disease X does not help us to understand why there was a difference between the percentages of the members of the two groups who were  with disease X. After all, regardless of how long it takes to be treated for disease X, it remains the case that more people in the first group than in the second group were diagnosed with disease X, and the volunteers in both groups had the same amount of time to develop disease X.\n\nSo, regardless of how long it takes to be treated for disease X, we still have basically the same information about people being diagnosed with disease X we had before.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nRegardless of whether the volunteers were told what disease they were being screened for, they were still diagnosed with disease X in different percentages in the two groups, and this choice does not help us to determine why that difference existed.\n\nAfter all, even if there's some way telling the volunteers would have affected whether they experienced disease X, this choice does not say that the volunteers in one group but not the other were told what disease they were being screened for.\n\nSo, regardless of whether, yes, this choice is true or, no, this choice is not true, the support the evidence we have provides for the conclusion is the same.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe information mentioned by this choice would help us to evaluate the case for believing that disease X must have disappeared without medical treatment in some individuals in the second group.\n\nAfter all, if the answer is that the medical screening used in the study NEVER produces erroneous diagnoses of disease X, then we have eliminated a possible alternative cause for the  difference between the percentages of the volunteers in the two groups diagnosed with disease X. We've eliminated the possibility that the difference is attributable to erroneous diagnoses. So, information that the frequency of erroneous diagnoses is never strengthens the case for the researchers' conclusion.\n\nOn the other hand, if the medical screening used in the study OFTEN produces erroneous diagnoses of disease X, then we have a possible alternative cause for the difference between the percentages of the volunteers in the two groups diagnosed with disease X. It could be that the reason for the difference is that some of the diagnoses of the volunteers in the first group were erroneous.\n\nIn fact, notice that, if the medical screening often produces erroneous diagnoses of disease X, then the fact that the members of the first group were screened more gave them more opportunities to be erroneously diagnosed with disease X.\n\nSo, the information that the frequency of erroneous diagnoses is often weakens the case for the researchers' conclusion by providing reason to believe that there may have been a different cause for the difference between the percentages of the volunteers in the two groups diagnosed with disease X.\n\nSo, having information on how frequently the medical screening produces erroneous diagnoses of disease X would help us to strengthen or weaken the case for the researchers' conclusion and thus evaluate the argument.\n\nThe correct answer is (E).",

There is no distinction between transactions of less than 10 gallons and more than 10 gallons. \n\nWhat would help us evaluate this conclusion?\n\nThe only relevant options are (A) and (C) so let's look at them.\n\n(A) In the areas in which XT’s gasoline stations operate, how did total combined gasoline sales for all gasoline stations last August compare with sales for the previous August? \n\nThis questions whether the overall gasoline revenue has seen arise this time. \n- Say combined gasoline sales for all stations this time is 10% more than the previous August. Then most gasoline stations would have seen this 10% rise in August sales. Hence the promotion would have had no impact.\n- Say combined gasoline sales for all stations this time is no more than the previous August. Then we can say with more certainty that the promotion has had impact.\nHence how we answer this question affects our conclusion. \n\n(C) Were there any customers who bought ten or more gallons at an XT gasoline station during the promotion who would have or more gallons at an XT gasoline in lower quantities, but more frequently, if the promotion had not been in effect? \n\nHere is the reason this is not helpful to evaluate. The station is trying to increase its overall revenue - whether it is through 10 gallons sales or fewer gallons sale is immaterial. The overall sales has increased. \nWhen we compare customers who bought 10 or more gallons fewer times compared to earlier when they bought the SAME amount of fuel but by visiting more frequently, it doesn't impact the station. These people are today also buying  that they were buying a year ago. Whether they did it in small amounts or one big, it doesn't impact the success of the promotion at all. What impacts is whether there are people who were not buying at this station or were buying less total amount in the month before but are now buying higher amount. That is what we need to evaluate. That is what will define the success of the promotion. \n\nAnswer (A)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "­Scientists studying fossils of a species of dinosaur found stones in the dinosaurs' stomach area. These dinosaurs were vegetarians, but their teeth could not have chewed a sufficient quantity of vegetation well enough to provide nutrition to support their large size. Thus, the stones may have served to help grind up the dinosaurs' food, just as happens with ostriches and some other modern birds. Alternatively the stones may have served as nutritional supplements, supplying minerals not found in vegetation in large enough quantities.\n\nIn order to help decide between the two hypotheses for the stones' function, which of the following would it be most useful to know?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "We see that the passage presents two possible purposes of the stones:\n\n\n\nThe support for both hypotheses is the following:\n\n\n\nWe see that the reasoning supporting the hypotheses is that, since the dinosaurs' teeth could not have chewed a sufficient quantity of vegetation well enough to provide nutrition to support their large size, the stones must have either helped them grind the vegetation or provided additional nutrition.\n\n\n\nThe answers to the question presented by the correct answer will either weaken the case for one of the hypotheses, strengthen the case for the other, or weaken the case for one while also strengthening the case for the other.\n\n\n\nThe answers to the question presened by this choice would help with determining whether the hypothesis that the dinosaurs swallowed the stones for the purpose of grinding their food is correct. After all, if the answer to the question presented by this choice is \"Yes,\" then it is reason to believe that the dinosaurs swallowed the stones for food grinding purposes, and if the answer to this question is \"No,\" then it is reason to believe that the dinosaurs did not swallow the stones for food grinding purposes.\n\nNow, the answers to the question presented by this choice have no direct effect on the case for the hypothesis that the stones may have served as nutritional supplements because, regardless of whether the stones had sufficient volume to efficiently grind the vegetation that served as the dinosaurs food, they could have served as nutritional supplements.\n\nAt the same time, if we have the answer to the question presented by this choice, then we do have at least some indication regarding whether the stones served as nutritional supplements. After all, if the stones did not have sufficient volume to efficiently grind the vegetation, then they likely served some other purpose, information making it more likely that the stones served as nutritional supplements.\n\nSo, we can see that the answers to the question presented by this choice indicate both whether the stones served to grind the vegatation and whether they served as nutritional supplements, with a Yes answer to the question supporting the vegetation grinding hypothesis over the supplements hypothesis and a No answer supporting the supplements hypothesis over the vegetation grinding hypothesis.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThe correct answer must present a question such that the answers indicate that the stones served ONE OR THE OTHER of the two possible purposes mentioned by the passage.\n\nOn the other hand, since we already know that stones swallowed by ostriches help to grind their food, the answer to this question would indicate whether the stones serve BOTH of the two possible purposes mentioned the passage. So, the answers would not indicate what we need them to indicate.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nNotice that, regardless of whether stones were found in the stomachs of other species of dinosaurs, we still would not have information on WHY the stones were there, and the correct answer to this question must be one such that the answers to the question it presents indicate what the purpose of the stones was.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nWhether any large modern animals eat the same sort of vegetation as these dinosaurs ate has no bearing on the argument. After all, the point of the argument is not whether they ate the vegetation or whether the vegatation could have provided sufficient nutrition.\n\nThe point is that the dinosaurs' teeth were such that they could not have gotten the nutrition they needed by chewing vegetation, so tbey needed to get it in some other way, and we are seeking to determine which way that was.\n\nNow, if this choice were about modern animals using stones to grind food or getting nutrition from stones, the answers to the question it presents might indicate something about why the dinosaurs ate the stones.\n\nAs this choice is, though, the answers to the questions it presents have no effect on case for either hypothesis.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nNotice that this choice is about \"the fossilized bones\" of the dinosaurs. When bones fossilize, their composition changes from what it orignaly was when the animal that had the bones was living.\n\nSo, this choice is not about whether the bones of the dinosaurs contained any minerals. It's about whether the bones still have minerals they would have contained while the dinosaurs were living.\n\nAfter all, the passage says the following:\n\n\n\nWe see that the passage indicates that the dinosaurs definitely needed nutrition they could not get by chewing vegatation. So, there is no question that, when they were alive, their bodies were using nutrition, such as minerals, that they would have taken in in some way other than chewing vegatation.\n\nThus, regardless of what the answer to the question presented by this choice is, the dinosaurs could have gotten necessary nutrition from the stones.\n\nSo, the answers to the question presented by this choice have no effect on the case for either hypothesis.\n\nEliminate.\n\n A­",

        "question": "A recent study of the reading habits of grade school students found that the great majority of young readers prefer books with relatable characters, humor, and fantasy elements, and that these readers were significantly more likely to finish reading a book if it possessed one or more of these preferred characteristics. However, awards for children’s literature are typically given to serious, realistic narratives, often featuring important historical persons and events. Therefore, since adults give preference to award-winning titles when selecting books to provide to children, awards for children’s literature have the unintended consequence of discouraging reading among school-age children.\n\nIn assessing the conclusion above, it would be useful to determine which of the following?\n\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Official Explanation:\n\n \n\nThe words  in the question stem indicate that this is an Evaluate the Argument question.\n\n\n \nThe first two sentences are premises that seem to draw a contrast between the kinds of books that children are likely to finish reading and the kinds of books that are likely to receive awards. In the final sentence, the author provides one more premise——before concluding that awards discourage children from reading. \n\n \n\nFor an Evaluate question, the goal is to find the answer that addresses an assumption of the argument. The answer to the question or consideration in the correct answer should help to strengthen or weaken the argument, so it’s important to identify the assumptions of the argument. This argument relies on two key, unstated assumptions:\n\n\nFor the first of these assumptions, who says that serious, realistic books can’t also be funny or have relatable characters? The author just assumes that the award-winning books are more lacking in these traits than average.\n\nAs for the second assumption, the author is trying to build a case that these awards discourage reading because they entice adults to buy books that kids are apparently less likely to finish. However, even if a kid doesn’t finish a book, does that automatically mean they are discouraged from reading?\n\n\n\n(A) This choice addresses only children who do actually finish a book. It doesn’t address whether children actually  finish books about historical characters. Also, this choice doesn’t indicate whether the books it mentions are award-winners.\n\n(B) The argument already says that children are more likely to finish books with a preferred trait. Beyond that, it isn’t helpful to know anything about completion rates for books with all three traits, especially since there is no information given on how common such books are among regular and award-winning books. \n\n(C) This is tempting because the conclusion states that the awards have an . The award doesn’t have to have the goal of encouraging reading in order for it to have the unintended consequence of discouraging reading. For example, the goal of the award could be to reward talented artists or to increase children’s awareness of historical events. \n\n(D) The final premise establishes that adults are somehow able to give preference to these books, so it isn’t necessary to know that the award is indicated on the cover. As for kids, this might go either way. First, do they know that they are less likely to finish an award-winner? And if so, does this discourage them, or does it enable them to detect and avoid the books they don’t want to read? On its own, this choice does nothing to address the assumptions. \n\n This choice addresses the first assumption. It isn’t clear from the premises that award winners are more likely to lack the three preferred traits. There is also no information about how often -award winners have these traits. If award-winning books are less likely to have the three preferred traits, then the author’s conclusion may be correct. If, on the other hand, award-winning books are just as likely as other books to have at least one trait from the list, then the author’s conclusion is less likely to be correct.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

Under this tax plan, Carina citizens in the AMT bracket would be exempt from paying taxes on the first $80,000 of their income and be taxed at a flat rate on the income thereafter. People paying the AMT would not be given allowances regular taxpayers are, such as deductions for children, healthcare expenses, or college tuition.\n\nWhich of the following would be most important to determine in order to evaluate whether implementing the AMT plan would be profitable for the city of Carina?\n\n",

It makes sense, then, that it would be helpful to know the amount of money the city currently loses through such exemptions, (B), in order to compare this to the potential revenues gained by instituting an AMT.\n\nBecause the question is concerned only with the profits to be gained by instituting an AMT for people who earn over $350,000, information about the city’s taxpayers in general, (A), would not be very useful.\n\n(C) would provide us with information about two particular exemptions that the high-income Carina citizens can currently take, but it does not provide us with as full a view of the possible profitability of an AMT as (B) does.\n\nWhile (D) may have some relevance to the town, it does not provide specific information on Carina’s situation in the way that (B) does. This information could be useful, but it is not the best choice of the answers provided.\n\nThe cost of processing the new tax forms (E) is likely to be small in comparison to the money gained or lost implementing the new tax, so while (E) might, at some point, be useful for government officials to know, it is not as useful as (B) in determining overall profitability.\n\nAnswer = (B)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

After all, if, as the passage says, the researcher predicted 90 percent of the divorces, then we know that the researcher did not predict 10 percent of the divorces since 100 percent - 90 percent = 10 percent.\n\n\n\nThe answer to this question is irrelevant. Regardless of whether other factors have a greater impact on the longevity of a marriage, it could be the case that the way spouses speak to each other is an important determinant of how their relationships turn out.\n\n\n\nNotice that, even if some couples spoke well to each other and got divorced, it still could be the case that the way spouses speak to each other is an important determinant of how their relationships turn out. The conclusion is not that speaking well solves all relationship problems. Also, “any” could be just one or two couples.\n\nAlso, the support for the conclusion is that the researcher predicted 90 percent of the divorces that occurred. So, we already know that 10 percent of the divorces were not predicted through observation of how the people spoke to each other. Thus, the answer to this question would not provide any useful new information.\n\n\n\nNotice that, if the answer to this question is “a large proportion,” then the support for the conclusion is weakened.. After all, in that case, it appears that the researcher simply predicted that most of the couples, both those who did get divorced and those who didn’t, would get divorced.\n\nSo, in that case, the fact that the researcher correctly predicted the divorces is meaningless. The researcher’s method didn’t really work. He just predicted that most people would get divorced, and his prediction seemed correct in the cases of people who did get divorced.\n\nSo, if the answer to this question is  “a high proportion,” the fact that the researcher predicted the divorces doesn’t provide much support for the conclusion.\n\nOn the other hand, if the answer to this question is “a small proportion,” then the researcher’s method seems to work well, and the argument is strengthened.\n\nThus the answer to this question is helpful in evaluating the argument.\n\n\n\nThe  answer to this question is not helpful because the observations and predictions remain essentially the same regardless of whether the researcher himself made the observations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

So, he assumes the large scale guys are .\n\nOn the other hand, in option A =  (),  I mean, that is not the essence of the passage. Option A is something I treat as a very generic statement. He does confuse it to be honest. And yes he does say some facts about small scale guys and generalize about large scale guys based on those facts. But if you look at E, it is bang on the money. I agree option A is also somewhat true, but very vague and not specific vulnerability. \nAlso, is he simply confusing from small guys facts to large scale?

While most experts rank Cezanne as an early modernist, a small few reject this idea.

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The correct answer choice is (C) \n\nThe final three problems in this section are harder than the previous five. This problem is answered correctly by about 45% of test takers and is classified as difficult (the hardest GMAT questions have success rates under 20%. Fortunately, questions this difficult appear infrequently). Students can miss questions for a variety of reasons: \n\n \n\nGiven that the stimulus is a simple fact set and that none of the incorrect answers attracted more than 15% of test takers, the difficulty in this problem apparently lies in the correct answer. \n\nAnswer choice (A): The controversy in the stimulus is about the categorization of Cézanne as an artist, not about Cézanne’s work. Further, even if the answer did correctly reference the categorization controversy, the answer would still be suspect because of the word “highly.” The stimulus indicates that only a small few reject the categorization of Cézanne as an early modernist and most experts accept it. \n\nAnswer choice (B): The stimulus asserts that Cézanne inspired the creators of abstract art, not that Cézanne himself created abstract art. \n\nAnswer choice (C): This correct answer is a paraphrase of the first sentence. The deceptiveness of this answer lies in two areas: 1. The substitution of “develop” for “inspire.” Some students feel the word “develop” is too strong, but if Cézanne inspired the creators of the next generation of art then he helped develop it. 2. The use of the word “modernism.” Some students are thrown off by “modernism” because they expect to see “abstract” instead. The stimulus is careful about saying “twentieth-century modernist creators of abstract art.” Notice how the test makers use answer choice (B)—which mentions “abstract”—to subtly prepare you to make this error. \n\nAnswer choice (D): The first sentence indicates that Cézanne inspired the modernist creators. The rest of the stimulus discusses a disagreement about the categorization of Cézanne that is not resolved in favor of either group. Hence, there is no way for us to determine if modern art owes less to Cézanne than many experts believe. \n\nAnswer choice (E): The word “tends” is the problem in this answer choice. Logically, “tends” means “most.” So, according to answer choice (E), Cézanne’s work is usually misinterpreted as modernist. The stimulus disagrees with this view: only a “small few” reject the categorization of Cézanne as a modernist whereas the majority accepts it. Further, the disagreement in the stimulus involves art experts, and from their view we would dispute answer choice (E). Answer choice (E) can also be understood as involving all interpretation of Cézanne’s work—whether by art expert or not—and from this perspective the answer is still unsupported since the views of others are not discussed in the stimulus.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "explanation": "was originally discovered and extracted in India as much as 6,000 years ago.

Having heard rumors of exceptionally strong stones, the Greeks developed a mythology about an unbreakable stone that was known as . By the Middle Ages, this came to be recognized as the diamond.

According to the passage, the stone itself originally came from India but passed through the Greek tradition as the word , meaning “unbreakable” or “untamed.” Before encountering physical diamonds, the Greeks had heard rumors of a very strong stone, and they developed a mythology around it, calling it  and giving the stone the quality of being unbreakable. The author notes that by the medieval era, the diamond was recognized as a real gem, but the adamant remained in the literary tradition for its mythical qualities. Contemporary writers continue to reference it as an allegory. The question asks the student to identify the answer choice that is best supported by the claims in the passage. This is primarily an inference question with the added quality of being a , so the student needs to approach it in a similar fashion to previous inference questions. The student should begin by considering whether the inference is correct and from there decide if the inference may be accurately converted into a claim. : A  is a statement that is not necessarily a direct inference from the passage but is rather a statement that infers something from the passage and derives an argument from it. \n\nAnother way to word this type of question is to ask whether or not the author of the passage would agree with the claim. If yes, the answer choice is probably correct. If no, the claim is assuming more than the author of the passage implies.\n\n\n\nB Answer choice (B) accurately provides an inference that has clear antecedent in the passage. The author of the passage claims, “By the Middle Ages, this came to be recognized as the diamond. Over time, the legendary adamant came to take on a mystical quality that passed into certain forms of medieval literature and, even today, has an allegorical place in some genres.” This means that the inference and claim made in answer choice (B) are correct: the adamant was originally associated with mythical qualities, and as a result writers still utilize it in literature for its figurative (or allegorical) attributes. Answer choice (B) is correct.\n\n\n\nA At no point does the author indicate that it would have been better for the diamond to have remained a mystery in Western literature. In fact, the author makes virtually no judgment statements about the discovery of diamonds, focusing only on the facts about them. Answer choice (A) assumes far more than the passage suggests, so it is incorrect.\n\nC Answer choice (C) is tricky, because the author does suggest that what was once known as the adamant was ultimately recognized to be the diamond. But the author also goes on to indicate that there are clear connotations in the use of each term, so the student cannot infer that the  may be interchanged without question. Answer choice (C) is incorrect.\n\nD The author discusses the use of the Greek word  and its meaning, but the author does  clearly connect this word to a word of ancient India. The author says only that the gem itself was mined in India. Answer choice (D) assumes too much, so it cannot be correct.\n\nE The author of the passage does not indicate whether or not the Greeks were correct in identifying the stone as unbreakable. In fact, the author suggests that the qualities now associated with the mythology of the adamant were just that—mythology. As a result, answer choice (E) assumes too much, so it cannot be correct.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

The experience of running a major corporation is a valuable preparation for the task of running a state government.\n\nM. Siuzdak's response shows that she has interpreted Mr. Janeck's remark to imply which of the following?\n",

I know that Ms. Siuzdak interprets Mr. Janeck’s remark to imply something. Great, lets go ahead and read the stimulus.\n\nMr Janeck talks about the unwillingness of voters to elect a businessman without political experience to such a position.\n\nMs Siuzdak says, \"You are wrong.\" and goes on to elaborate how experience of running a business prepares one to run the government.\n\nWhen I read Ms. Siuzdak's response, I think, \"She is interpreting an implication in Mr Janeck's remark. What is it?\"\nIt does strike me as odd that he only mentioned how voters feel. He did not say that Stevenson was unsuitable for office while Ms. Siuzdak tries to convince him why Stevenson is suitable. She doesn't say something like, \"You are wrong.  the experience of running a major corporation is a valuable preparation for the task of running a state government.\"\n\nNow I look at the options. It is pretty clear that she interpreted that Mr Janeck believes Stevenson is not suitable for office. (A) is the correct answer.\n(D) is incorrect. The issue is experience here. Not how profit chasing  affects the character of a person and makes him unsuitable for government office.\n(E) is incorrect because she overlooked voters completely and responded to Mr Janeck as if he had said the following: \"A businessman with no political experience should not be elected to such a responsible public office.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "Multi-party initiatives are becoming increasingly popular among the members of the parliament of Country W. Although legislation proposed under the auspices of more than one party may not adhere as strictly to the agenda of each of the parties involved as legislation proposed by only one party, the political backing of the voting blocs represented by the cooperating parties make such proposals more likely to pass than proposals that come from a single faction alone. The benefit of multi-party initiatives is that legislation important to the general welfare of Country W that might otherwise have foundered in inter-party disagreements can effectively be enacted.\n\nWhich of the following can be inferred from the passage above?\n",

        "question": "The vast majority of extant music from the medieval period is recorded on manuscripts. The production of medieval manuscripts was very costly, because all manuscripts were painstakingly copied by hand onto an expensive form of parchment. As a result, few people were able to produce or own them, and the Catholic Church, which had literate scribes as well as considerable wealth, produced and maintained most manuscripts during the Middle Ages. Any medieval music not recorded on manuscripts has now been lost to history. Most of the medieval music still in existence is sacred music.\n\nThe claims made in the above passage, if true, best support which of the following statements?\n\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "E In question 3, the student is asked to select a statement that is supported by the claims made in the passage. To do this, the student must infer from what is stated directly. Based on these claims, answer choice (E) is the only one that fulfills this requirement. The passage states quite clearly, “Any medieval music not recorded on manuscripts has now been lost to history. Most of the medieval music still in existence is sacred music.” If most extant medieval music is sacred music, and any music not recorded on manuscripts has been lost to history, then it follows that most popular music was not recorded on manuscripts and thus has been lost to history. It can safely be inferred from this fact that historians do not know much about popular medieval music because they have almost nothing to study. Answer choice (E) is correct.\n\n\nA Answer choice (A) is incorrect because the passage does not offer an evaluative judgment on the music that is still extant, nor does it suggest anywhere that sacred music was recorded because it was the “greatest music” of the period. Historians might rightly debate this issue, but the passage does not discuss it or imply anything about it.\n\nB As with answer choice (A), the passage does not imply answer choice (B). The passage describes facts about the way medieval music was recorded and about what medieval music still exists, but it does not provide an answer to why most of the extant music from the Middle Ages is sacred music. Therefore, in no place in the passage does the author suggest that the Church recorded only medieval music because it did not value popular music. Answer (B) should be eliminated immediately.\n\nC While answer choice (C) might very well be true, the substance of this statement is not discussed at all in the passage and cannot be inferred from any statement made within it. Answer (C) is thus irrelevant and should be eliminated immediately.\n\nD The passage does indicate that the Church was not necessarily the only institution to have the means of affording manuscripts: “As a result, few were able to produce or own them, and the Catholic Church, which had literate scribes as well as considerable wealth, produced and maintained most manuscripts during the Middle Ages.” This suggests logically that other institutions such as the aristocracy might very well have been able to produce and maintain some of the manuscripts. But nowhere does the passage discuss the contents of aristocratic households or that aristocrats might have held large numbers of manuscripts, so this statement cannot be inferred from the passage\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

The doctors at the hospital, however, cannot provide enough time for every patient unless the doctor staff is increased by more than twenty percent.

        "explanation": "D\n\nThe phrase \"most strongly supports\" indicates an inference question. It's not explicitly an explanation or paradox question, but the passage does have a bit of a discrepancy, between the employment figures in the two regions compared to the different population figures in the two regions.\n\nChoice (A) assumes too much - there may well be enough people in the north to staff tourism-related companies. Beyond that, even if it weren't true, there's no reason the outside recruiting would have to take place in the south. (B) is only true if oil and tourism are the only two industries. Just because they are the largest doesn't mean they are the only ones; they could actually represent a small portion of the economy. (C) explains how more people in the south might be related to the oil industry, but there's no support for this. We don't know that refineries (or other oil-related companies) are in the south, or even in Frobnia at all.\n\nChoice (D) is our answer. We know that more than one-third of working Frobnians work in the tourism industry (which is in the north), while less than one-sixth work in the oil fields (in the south). Thus, a higher proportion of Frobnians work for either tourism or oil in the north than for tourism or oil in the south. (E) is a huge leap, and out of the scope of the passage.

The argument mentions that the scrutiny is expected to disqualify ten percent of all prospective donors, suggesting a decline in accepted donations; this answer choice, suggesting “fluctuations” in funding, indicates possible increase or decrease, and can only be partially established; this answer choice can stay after the first glance but shall eventually make way for a better, stronger answer choice; we have a more convincing answer choice in B.\n\nD. The argument mentions that the scrutiny is expected to disqualify ten percent of all prospective donors, suggesting a decline in accepted donations; however, the argument makes no suggestions regarding the purpose of donations; so, this answer choice, suggesting that donations made with the sole purpose of benefitting the donor will become rarer, cannot be established.

Let's take a look at each answer choice:\nThe only piece of data we're given in the passage is that the percentage of delays caused by airline error has decreased significantly . There is no indication that the financial concerns mentioned in (A) are a new factor. The airline may have been underreporting the percentage of flight delays caused by airline error for several years. \n\nThere is nothing in (A) that points out the logical flaw in linking the significant reduction in the percentage of delays caused by airline error  to the airline saying that preventable delays are clearly decreasing. (A) is out.\n\nThe passage says the airline listened to complaints  and addressed the problem. There is no information about what the airline did with complaints caused by uncontrollable factors.\n\nAlso, there is no indication that the  of complaints was important. The passage simply says that complaints were listened to.\n\n(B) does not point out a logical flaw in the argument -- (B) cannot be our answer.\n\nThere is no suggestion in the passage that complaints are being used as the measure of the number of errors occurring in a year. We don't know how the errors are being measured so (C) does not show us a flaw in the reasoning -- (C) is out.\n\nIf delays caused by uncontrollable factors increased dramatically in the year we're interested in, then the  of delays caused by airline error could have decreased significantly.\n\nThis is true even if the number of delays caused by airline error remained the same, or even increased somewhat. Therefore, the  of delays caused by airline error could have decreased, while the  or delays caused by airline error could have increased.\n\nThis is a flaw in the argument's reasoning -- (D) looks good, but let's take a look at (E):\nWe're not worried about the customers' beliefs -- we're looking at the link between the percentage of delays caused by airline error and the actual number of delays caused by airline error.\n\n(E) does not help us examine this argument, so we can eliminate (E).\n\nThis means (D) is the only answer choice we have not eliminated.

Yet this cannot be the motive since, as the Distopians foresaw, Distopia’s federal expenses for the intervention were eight billion dollars, whereas, during the war, profits from the Distopian industrialists’ facilities in Arcadia totaled only four billion dollars.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, exposes a serious flaw in the argument made in the second sentence above?\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "The author's conclusion is that the industrialists' motive for promoting Distopian intervention in the Arcadian civil war could NOT have been to insure that the industrialists’ facilities in Arcadia made substantial profits during the war. Why not?\n\nThe author's argument is only concerned with profits at the facilities in Arcadia. Choice (A) is irrelevant and can be eliminated.\n\nThe author reasons that since the federal expenses outweigh the profits from the Distopian industrialists’ facilities in Arcadia, the industrialists must not have been motivated by a desire to insure profits during the war. But if the largest proportion of those federal expenses is paid by people/groups other than the industrialists, that means that the cost of those expenses to the industrialists must have been less than half of eight billion. Furthermore, if the industrialists only had to pay for a small proportion of the federal expenses, then they may have enjoyed substantial profits during the war. This possibility significantly weakens the author's argument, so hang on to choice (B).\n\nThe author's argument revolves around whether the industrialists were motivated by a desire to insure profits DURING THE WAR. The evidence in support of the author's conclusion also involves wartime figures. Choice (C), which discusses postwar profits, has not impact on the author's argument and can be eliminated.\n\nAgain, the author's argument is only concerned with wartime profits. Choice (D) has no impact on the author's conclusion or the supporting evidence. Eliminate (D).\n\nAn alternative motive for promoting intervention could actually strengthen the author's argument. However, choice (E) does not explain why the industrialists promoted intervention (if anything, it could be a reason why the industrialists did NOT want to promote intervention).

They claim that keeping taxes high does not hinder national prosperity, and (A) confirms that lowering taxes would not increase national prosperity. Eliminate (A).\nThe wording of (B) can seem confusing, but remember the politicians’ argument. They claim that high taxes (“a factor”)  national prosperity. But do they confuse that claim with the claim that high taxes (“the same factor”)  national prosperity? Well, no. Their conclusion remains that high taxes  national prosperity. They never take the next step and suggest that high taxes  national prosperity. So, they do not confuse the two claims (B) outlines, and we can eliminate it.\nThe politicians conclude that the level of taxes in Countries X and Y explains the discrepancy in per-capita income. But (C) introduces the possibility that factors other than taxation influence per-capita income. For example, it’s possible that Country X is more abundant in national resources than Country Y or that Country X is more technologically advanced than Country Y. If either of these is the case, then high taxes could hinder national prosperity in Country X, but not to the extent that per-capita income in Country X falls below that of Country Y. The politicians fail to consider this possibility, so let’s keep (C).\nThe politicians’ argument assumes that the per-capita income of a country is a reliable indicator of that country’s national prosperity. However, it does not assume that per-capita income DETERMINES the rate of economic growth. Eliminate (D).\nThe economists’ thesis is that low taxes spur economic growth and thus lead to greater national prosperity. On the other hand, the politicians claim that high taxes do not hinder national prosperity. So, rather than assume the economists’ thesis is correct, the politicians suggest that the economists’ thesis is incorrect. Eliminate (E).\n\n(C) is the best answer choice.\n\nI hope that helps!­\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "Politician: The huge amounts of money earned by oil companies elicit the suspicion that the regulations designed to prevent collusion need to be tightened. But just the opposite is true. If the regulations designed to prevent collusion are not excessively burdensome, then oil companies will make profits sufficient to motivate the very risky investments associated with exploration that must be made if society is to have adequate oil supplies. But recent data show that the oil industry’s profits are not the highest among all industries. Clearly, the regulatory burden on oil companies has become excessive.\n\nThe reasoning in the politician’s argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "What is this guy talking about? The conclusion is, “Regulation of oil companies is excessive.” The evidence is, “Oil companies are making huge amounts of money,” and “If regulations are not excessively burdensome then oil companies will make profits sufficient to motivate them to invest and provide us with an adequate oil supply,” and “The oil industry’s profits are not the highest among all industries.” That last one makes me laugh. They aren’t the richest on the planet, therefore we should make them richer? Come on.\n\nThe question tells us there is a flaw in this reasoning, and I think the part that made me laugh is probably the biggest problem. You’re trying to tell me that just because they aren’t the richest industry of all, and even though we currently have an adequate oil supply, and even though the oil industry is making “huge amounts of money,” that we really need to cut these guys a break and remove the regulations? I’m not buying it.\n\nA) Yes, the politician assumed that if the oil barons weren’t the richest of all industrialists, then we’d better let them get even richer. The politician did employ a half-assed justification for this, with the bit about the risky investments that are required, but the problem with that analysis is that the risky investments currently are being made, so how could we conclude that the regs are too tight? I like this answer, because I feel like it points out the idiocy of the argument.\n\nB) The politician is on the oil companies’ side, so he definitely didn’t attack their character. Not even close. If you picked this answer, it’s a sure sign that you just aren’t reading carefully enough. Slow down.\n\nC) I’m very familiar with the dreaded correlation-therefore-causation flaw, but that’s not the flaw present in this argument. A is still the best answer.\n\nD) The argument actually doesn’t do this, because it cites “recent data” rather than citing an absence of evidence. No way.\n\nE) This would be the answer if the argument had said, “My LSAT teacher brings us cookies, therefore all LSAT teachers bring their students cookies.” But that’s not what happened in this actual argument.\n\nOur answer is A.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

Even with all that we would obviously still not truly comprehend the action or know why it occurred.\n\nWhich one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the argument’s reasoning?\n",

The last sentence seems to basically just restate the first sentence. I think this argument is circular, and it simply doesn’t hold water. You can’t use your conclusion as the only evidence to support that same conclusion. An example: “Hulk Hogan is the best pro wrestler because he is the best at pro wrestling.” Huh? This makes no sense.\n\nThe question asks us to identify a flaw in the argument, so I think “the argument is circular” or “the argument assumes its conclusion” would be a great answer.\n\nA) I don't see an analogy here. And anyway, I don’t think “superficiality” is the real problem. I think it’s circularity. So I’m hoping one of the other answer choices will say that.\n\nB) Boom. The argument assumes (or presumes, same thing) that its conclusion is true. That’s a circular argument.\n\nC) This is certainly a flaw.

        "question": "The coach of the Eagles used a computer analysis to determine the best combinations of players for games. The analysis revealed that the team has lost only when Jennifer was not playing. Although no computer was needed to discover this information, this sort of information is valuable, and in this case it confirms that Jennifer’s presence in the game will ensure that the Eagles will win.\n\nThe argument above is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "If you had problems here, you probably made a huge, unwarranted assumption: That Jennifer is  related to her team’s success. Remember: Correlation does not prove causation!\n\nJust because the team has happened to win every game Jennifer ever played in does not mean that the team is guaranteed to win the next game Jennifer plays in.\n\nIt’s quite possible, in fact, that Jennifer is the worst player in the history of sports. Imagine: Her coach only puts her in when the team is up by 30 points with 15 seconds to play. Jennifer instantly slam-dunks in the  goal the very second she is put into the game. Her team is now only up by 28. Then she steals the inbound pass from her own team and dunks in the wrong goal again—this time from the three-point line, while doing an NBA Jams-style 720-degree windmill. The net is on fire, the crowd is going berserk, LeBron James is on the sideline taking video of Jennifer with his iPhone. In five seconds, Jennifer has cost her team 5 points. But nobody can score 25 points in 15 seconds—so Jennifer’s team  wins every game she plays in.\n\nA) The problem with this argument is that it assumes that Jennifer’s presence in the game is sufficient for her team to win. It is absolutely not. Jennifer’s team, in my example, wins despite her. This can’t be the answer.\n\nB) The computer thing is a red herring. The argument’s main problem is that it assumes that any correlation that has held in the past will always hold in the future.\n\nC) Again, the computer thing is a red herring. Also, the conclusion of the argument is not about computer analysis.\n\nD) Bingo. As any shady mutual fund salesman won’t tell you (it’ll be buried in the fine print), past performance is no guarantee of future results.

After all, regardless of what the stories are based on, as long as they are pessimistic and therefore cause downward pressure on prices, the conclusion makes sense.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nWhat this choice describes is not a flaw because, if it is possible that widespread pessimistic news stories about real estate prices usually drive those prices to very low levels, then the argument works well. After all, the point of the argument is that people should buy when pessimistic news stories come out because prices will drop.\n\nSo, if prices may go to \"very low levels,\" the advice is even better.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nAs discussed above, the argument's conclusion is that, to get a good deal on a new home, a better strategy (than postponing) is to buy precisely when the media is advising everyone to sell.\n\nThe reasoning is that such news stories will serve to drive prices downward. So, \"precisely\" now, when the stories have come out, is a great time to buy.\n\nIn arriving at that conclusion, the broker has ignored a key fact: it could be that people are postponing home purchases not because that they are not aware that such news stories serve to drive prices downward but rather because it's a good idea to postpone home purchases now because it will take time for the stories to affect prices.\n\nIn other words, in recommending that people buy now because pessimistic news stories drive down prices, the broker has taken for granted that prices will drop \"precisely when the media is advising everyone to sell,\" in other words, \"quickly.\"\n\nKeep.\n\n E­",

Thus, any book that has been photocopied since 1978 without the publisher's permission must be at least fifty years old.\n\nThe reasoning above exhibits a flaw similar to one in which of the following?\n",
        "answer": "Edited the question.",
        "explanation": "The most helpful first step in this situation is to identify the flaw in the reasoning given in the passage and then proceed to eliminate answers based on whether they exhibit a similar flaw. Consider the logic of the passage:\n\n (LEGALLY) not be photocopied without permission. Any book copied without permission since 1978  (NECESSARILY) be at least 50 years old.\nThe argument assumes that because books less than 50 years old are not LEGALLY allowed to be photocopied, they NECESSARILY are not photocopied. But just because there is a man-made law prohibiting something does not mean that everyone follows that law. So, the logical error committed by the passage is assuming that the presence of a man-made law means that particular law is ALWAYS followed.\n\nWith that in mind, consider (A):\n\n(A) is tricky. The law under consideration is that every member of the solar system must (NECESSARILY, ) be a planet or moon. It then concludes that because an asteroid does not satisfy this condition, it is not a member of the solar system. (A) is incorrect because it confuses  law with  law. Natural law is something that, according to science, NECESSARILY be followed. That’s different than saying something must LEGALLY be followed. For that reason, (A) does not contain the same logical error as the passage, and we can eliminate it.\n\nNow here’s (C):\n\n(C) first identifies a man-made law: any driver who turns right must (LEGALLY) signal. Then, it assumes that that law is always (NECESSARILY) followed: a driver who turns right ALWAYS signals and thus a driver who DOES NOT signal DID NOT turn right. This is precisely the same logical error (assuming that because something is LEGALLY required it is NECESSARILY required) as is committed in the passage. Let’s keep (C).\n\nAnd here’s (D):\n\nAgain, (D) first states a man-made law:  crossing a national boundary requires a passport. But it does not assume that this law is ALWAYS followed. Instead, it suggests that to ignore this law is ILLEGAL. Because (D) qualifies its conclusion with the word “legally”, it allows for the possibility that people break the law (and cross national boundaries illegally) and thus does not commit the same logical error as the passage. Eliminate (D).\n\n(C) is the best answer choice.\n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

Hence, it weakens the mayor's argument since the hiring could have a net negative effect on the future budget.\n\nThe only other relevant options are (A) and (D)\n\n[A]There is a saturation point at which additional parking enforcement officers bring in slightly less than the officers hired before them.\nThis tells you that the positive effect may be SLIGHTLY less.

The hiring could still have a net positive effect on the budget.\n\n[D]Fines for parking are going to be increased dramatically, which usually results in fewer overall tickets being issued.\nIf parking fine amount will be increased, it will increase the revenue.

        "question": "Economist: In a weak economy when the stock market is struggling, the U.S. dollar traditionally fails, and the price of gold rises in response to the declining dollar. Recent economic data indicate that the markets are currently struggling: the key stock indexes are lower than they have been in at least two years, and various market sectors are in decline. At the same time, the value of the dollar is still high, and the price of gold remains low. Therefore, the price of gold suggests that we are due for a market turnaround soon.\n\nGiven the information above, the economist’s argument is flawed because:\n\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This question is difficult because it requires the student to pay very careful attention both to the information in the passage and to the question itself in order to deduce the flaw in the economist’s reasoning. The economist makes a claim about traditional indicators during a weak economy: the value of the dollar fails, and the price of gold rises. The economist then notes that all economic indicators point to a weak economy, but the expected low dollar/high gold movement is absent. The economist then concludes that the market can be expected to turn around. From a purely economic perspective, there are a number of problems with the economist’s reasoning; however, the student does not need to know specific details about economics beyond the information contained in the passage. The most important consideration is that the economist notes a specific precedent: when there is a weak economy, the dollar should fail and gold should rise. Because gold is not rising, the economist concludes that the precedent still holds firm and that the market will be strong again. This conclusion raises the central question of whether the market precedent is still relevant, and this is an issue the economist fails to raise.\n\n\n\nA In deriving his conclusion, the economist discusses only the precedents that determine market movement. His information, however, suggests that the movements in the market might be anomalous and thus that precedent alone cannot determine the conclusion that he reaches. Therefore, the economist’s conclusion has the weakness of failing to consider the very anomalies he indicates. Answer choice (A) most clearly states this and is the correct answer.\n\n\n\nB, C Answer choices (B) and (C) require knowledge about economics in general (and the market in particular) that is not contained within the passage. Although both answer choices might very well be true, this cannot be determined from the information provided within the passage. Thus, answer choices (B) and (C) cannot be correct.\n\nD Answer choice (D) suggests that the economist should focus on the movement of market sectors over stock market indicators and the prices of the dollar and gold. But the passage does not suggest anywhere that an economist should focus on one element of market movement over another, so this answer choice makes assumptions that cannot be inferred from the passage. Answer choice (D) is incorrect.\n\nE Answer choice (E) is tempting because it suggests that the economist is overlooking key data in reaching his conclusion, but the passage offers no indication that certain data is required to reach a conclusion – only that certain precedents are traditional in reaching a conclusion. Therefore, answer choice (E) makes assumptions that cannot be inferred and is incorrect.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

However, it might very likely be the case that these large scale guys DO NOT use the material because they have already tried it and they hate it.

He does confuse it to be honest. And yes he does say some facts about small scale guys and generalize about large scale guys based on those facts. But if you look at E, it is bang on the money. I agree option A is also somewhat true, but very vague and not specific vulnerability. \nAlso, is he simply confusing from small guys facts to large scale? I can clearly see a very troublesome assumption i.e. \"familiarity with material\". That is the primary flaw. He is very wrongly assuming that large scale guys are \"not familiar\". \n\nI hope you see what A vs E is. A is very vague. E is right on the money. Honestly, A is true too.

        "question": "Urban rail systems have been proposed to alleviate traffic congestion, but results in many cities have been cited as evidence that this approach to traffic management is ineffective. For example, a U.S. city that opened three urban rail branches experienced a net decline of 3,100 urban rail commuters during a period when employment increased by 96,000. Officials who favor urban rail systems as a solution to traffic congestion have attempted to counter this argument by noting that commuting trips in that city represent just 20 percent of urban travel.\n\nThe response of the officials to the claim that urban rail systems are ineffective is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it\n",

        "explanation": "Problem: Traffic congestion (too may cars on the roads)\n\nDebate between supporters and opposers of Urban Rail:\n\nSupporters of Urban Rail: Urban Rail reduces congestion.\n\nOpposers of Urban Rain: Not effective. In a city, when employment increased by 96,000, there was a decline of 3100 commuters (people who travel to and fro office every day). So urban rail did not reduce congestion.\n\nSupporters of Urban Rail: Commuter trips represent just 20% of travel in that city. (The commuter trips are not the main source of congestion. Perhaps other 80% cause congestion and they have been using the urban rail and hence reducing congestion. So reduction in commuter trips doesn't say much about whether rails are effective. So if one small fraction isn't using the urban rails much, it doesn't matter. Perhaps others are using and hence traffic is lower)\n\nWhat will criticise this response of supporters?\n\nA) presents no evidence to show that the statistics are incorrect\n\nThe statistics needn't be incorrect. \n\nB) relies solely on general data about U.S. cities rather than data about the city in question\n\nIt does talk about that city. \n\nC) fails to consider that commuting trips may cause significantly more than 20 percent of the traffic congestion\n\nCorrect. The supporters are supporting - \"Urban rail reduces congestion.\" \nNow, what if most of the congestion is caused by commuters even though commuter travel is just 20% of travel? What if the morning and evening office times are the times of congestion because the roads cannot handle so  much commuter traffic. The other travel could be staggered around the day causing no congestion. Then if commuters are not using urban rail, it doesn't help in reducing congestion. \nCommuters may not be a big part of the total travellers but they could be the whole and sole cause of the congestion problem. \n\nD) fails to show that the decline in the number of urban rail commuters in one U.S. city is typical of U.S. cities generally\n\nNot correct. The opposers cited the example of one city and the supporters are presenting evidence in the case of that city itself. \n\nE) provides no statistics on the use of urban rail systems by passengers other than commuters\n\nNot correct.

So, economics dictate that we put up with the pollution.\n\n: I disagree: A great many cross-country skiers are now kept from visiting Milville by the noise and pollution that snowmobiles generate.\n\nEnvironmentalist responds to the business spokesperson by doing which of the following?\n\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Let's start by breaking down the exchange between the environmentalist and the business spokesperson:\n\n impact on the economy, so the environmentalist concludes that economics do NOT dictate that the town should put up with the pollution. \n\nNotice that the environmentalist does not dispute the spokesperson's claim that snowmobiling brings in out-of-towners and thus has a positive economic consequence; rather, the environmentalist  that snowmobiling also has a negative economic impact.First, what are the \"desirable outcomes\" referenced in this passage? 1) financial benefit to local residents and 2) less air pollution. Where do those \"desirable outcomes\" come from? 1) from bringing in out-of-towners (ie snowmobilers or cross-country skiers) and 2) from banning snowmobiling. \n\nNotice that the spokesperson's argument does not require the assumption that either desirable outcome comes from only one set of circumstances. The spokesperson simply notes that snowmobiling brings in out-of-towners which creates a financial benefit, he/she does not imply that this is the only way to achieve that benefit. The environmentalist does not challenge this assumption because the spokesperson never makes that assumption. Choice (A) can be eliminated.\n\nAs discussed in (A), less air pollution is a desirable outcome, but what is the negative aspect of this outcome? Well, in order to achieve it, the town would have to ban snowmobiling, preventing those out-of-towners (those who want to enjoy snowmobiling) from coming to town and financially benefiting the locals. According to the spokesperson, this negative outcome (less financial benefit from out-of-towners) outweighs the desirable outcome (less air pollution). The environmentalist challenges this assumption by pointing out an economic benefit that would occur if snowmobiling were banned: more cross-country skiers would come to town, creating a financial benefit and offsetting the negative economic impact assumed by the spokesperson. (B) is looking pretty good.\n\nThe benefit that the spokesperson desires is financial benefit to the local residents. Although the environmentalist does imply that financial benefit can be created by a different means (ie banning snowmobiling and thus attracting more cross-country skiers), the environmentalist does NOT suggest that banning snowmobiling would achieve a GREATER degree of financial benefit than allowing snowmobiling. \n\nThe environmentalist is simply trying to demonstrate that the negative economic impact assumed by the spokesperson would not outweigh the positive environmental impact. This argument would hold up if both means created the same financial benefit. Choice (C) can be eliminated.\n\nNeither the spokesperson nor the environmentalist ever argues against the facts stated by the other person. Rather, each concedes the facts previously stated by the other person and simply adds new information to support a different conclusion. The environmentalist certainly does not claim that the spokesperson is \"deliberately misrepresenting the environmentalist's position,\" so choice (D) can be eliminated.\n\nThe environmentalist does not DENY that snowmobiling brings in out-of-towners or that it creates a financial benefit to the local residents. The environmentalist simply presents an additional economic factor that the spokesperson did not mention: although snowmobiling may bring in many people who want to snowmobile (a financial positive for the locals), snowmobiling keeps a great many cross-country skiers from visiting (a financial negative for the locals). \n\nChoice (E) can be eliminated, and we are left with (B).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "It is ludicrous to assert that the math department's new policy, allowing the use of nonprogrammable calculators during exams, is discriminatory. Though a calculator can be expensive, and some students will not be able to purchase one, the department is not requiring that students use one, it is only allowing them to do so if they desire. Thus, any student who does not purchase a calculator for use on his exams will not be penalized; he or she will be no worse off at exam time than he or she was prior to the policy change.\n\nTo which of the following would the opponents of the math department's new policy be most likely to refer, in an attempt to have the new policy abolished?",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Premises:\nSome students cannot purchase a calculator.\nMath department does not penalize people if they do not use a calculator.\nSo the situation of the people who cannot purchase calculators has not changed.\n\nConclusion: Math department's new policy is not discriminatory.\n\nWhat comes to my mind here is that the argument is correct in stating that the person who cannot buy a calculator has no disadvantages compared with the previous scenario  but other people are getting an advantage. They can use the calculator. So it is fine as long as the performance is not relative. Say, if some people are allowed to use a calculator and other are not in GMAT, it will affect the performance of those who cannot since the scores are in percentile i.e. relative performance.\n\nWhich option helps the people against the policy?\n\nA. The difference in speed between a top-of-the-line calculator and a bottom-end one is significant.\nThe issue is between people with no calculators and those with calculators. \n\nB. Each individual student's performance is evaluated against the performance of his or her fellow students on math department exams.\nThis tells you that the performance is relative. Hence, it is wrong if some people get an advantage. This is a good argument for people against the policy and hence, is the answer.\n\nC. The university student services department will make available to all students calculators that can be borrowed as library books are. \nThis argument is useful for those pro-policy.\n\nD. Much of the math being tested on most of the exams in question is so complex that it requires a calculator-like mind to do the necessary computations.\nThe people not using a calculator will not have any disadvantage. Their situation is the same - they had to do those calculations by hand before and they will have to do them the same way now. It doesn't help people who are against calculators. \n\nE. When calculators were not allowed, more than half of all students failed their math exams.\nThis is irrelevant. We don't know how much the calculator helps. It certainly help the case of those who are against calculators. If anything, it says that calculators might help and hence should be allowed. \n\nAnswer (B)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

The biologist concludes that the archipelago's 25–30 parts per thousand salinity range between March and June, the critical period for wild salmon migration, tends to suppress sea-lice proliferation.

At most, we can infer that higher salinity is  to sea-lice survival, which is different than the condition being absolutely necessary. Because the biologist never claims that anything is absolutely necessary to sea-lice survival, it is not accurate to say that the professor undermines such a claim.\n\nEliminate (A).\n\nThe professor doesn't think that the salinity measurements were inaccurate -- in fact, he/she uses the same numbers in his/her own argument. Eliminate (B).  \n\nThe biologist thinks that sea lice transmission is unlikely because the conditions in the archipelago \"tend to suppress\" sea-lice proliferation. The professor provides additional information, and then says that, actually, the conditions \"favor the  of sea lice.\"\n\nBecause the information provided by the professor completely contradicts the biologist's premise, we can determine that this additional evidence shows that the biologist's premise is false.\n\n(C) is looking good.\n\nThe professor never questions WHERE the biologist got his/her information, or the validity of those sources. (D) is out.\n\nNope, the professor doesn't attack the connection between the biologist's conclusion and premises.

        "question": "The trees always blossom in May if April rainfall exceeds 5 centimeters. If April rainfall exceeds 5 centimeters, then the reservoirs are always full on May 1. The reservoirs were not full this May 1 and thus the trees will not blossom this May.\n\n\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "When a Parallel Reasoning argument contains Formal\nLogic, translating the stimulus algebraically will make\nit much easier to compare to the answer choices.\nTranslating the first two sentences of the stimulus, we\nlearn that one trigger (April rainfall in excess of 5\ncentimeters—we’ll call this “X”) causes two necessary\nresults: the trees will blossom in May (we’ll call this\n“Y”), and the reservoirs will be full on May 1 (we’ll call\nthis “Z”). So in our formal logic notation, we can write\n“If X → Y” and “If X → Z.” Our last sentence tells us\nthat since our reservoirs aren’t full (in other words, “no\nZ”), the trees will not blossom (in other words, “no Y”).\nSo our final formal logic statement would be “No Z, so\nno Y.” The absence of one result does not guarantee\nthe absence of the other, so here is the flaw that we’re\nlooking for in the answer choices. Armed with our\nalgebraic notation, we can more easily find a match.\n The first two sentences of  give us two\nnecessary results following from the same trigger—\njust like the stimulus. Let “garlic in the pantry” equal\n“X,” “garlic still fresh” equal “Y,” and “potatoes on the\nbasement stairs” equal “Z.” Then we have “If X → Y”\nand “If X → Z.” Our last sentence says that the\npotatoes are not on the stairs (“no Z”), so the garlic\nisn’t fresh (“no Y”). Perfect match. We don’t even have\nto read any other answer choices because we just\nmatched the entire stimulus point by point.\n\nFor the record:\n actually connects statements correctly. Connecting\nthe first two sentences, we learn that if the jar is held\nover the burner for more than 2 minutes (“X”), it will\nreach optimal temperature (“Y”), which will in turn\ncause its contents to liquefy (“Z”). The conclusion of\n makes a sound deduction based on the connection\nof these statements. In our algebraic notation, this\nargument would have read as follows: “If X → Y; if Y →\nZ; X occurred, so Z occurred.” This is correct\nreasoning. Eliminate.\n\n Again, let’s do some algebraic substitution. We’ll\nlet “book set with wooden type” equal “X,” “book more\nthan 200 years old” equal “Y,” and “book classified as\nspecial” equal “Z.” In that case, the argument reads:\n“If Y → Z; if X → Y; no Z, so no X.” If we contrapose\nthe initial statements in this argument, we’ll see that it\nuses correct reasoning also. Eliminate.\n\nAbstracting the terms of this argument gives us “If\nX → no Y” (mower operating = “X” and engine flooded\n= “Y”), then “If Z → Y” (foot pedal depressed = “Z”).\nBut the conclusion becomes “no Z, so X.” We can’t\ncontrapose any statement to find out what happens if\nthere’s “no Z,” so the logic is certainly flawed here. It\njust isn’t flawed in the same way as that of the\nstimulus. Eliminate.\n\n follows exactly the same logically sound structure\nas , just in a slightly different order: “If X → Y; if Y\n→ Z; no Z, so no X.” Eliminate.",

        "question": "­In a recent government report, it was found that regions with a higher density of tech companies tend to have lower unemployment rates. The report suggests that the presence of these tech companies stimulates local economies by creating a high demand for skilled labor, which not only provides jobs within these companies but also boosts secondary employment in supporting industries. Based on this, the government is considering incentives to attract more tech companies to economically depressed regions.\n\nIf the statements above are true, which of the following must be true?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "in prizes such as Courses, Tests, Private Tutoring, \n        \n        \n    \n\n­\n\n\n\nIf tech companies stimulate local economies through high demand for skilled labor and boost secondary employment, it naturally follows that in regions where these companies are densely concentrated, there will be a greater creation of jobs, both skilled and in the supporting industries. This is a pretty simple logical conclusion: companies create jobs, therefore more companies results into more jobs.\n\n\n\n\nIt is not a guaranteed outcome. Not all regions may have the necessary conditions for this economic stimulation (like available skilled labor or infrastructure), making it a presumption rather than a certainty. There are reasons why tech companies concentrate in some regions rather than others.\n\n\n\nThis statement presumes that incentives alone will lead to lower unemployment rates, but there is no guarantee that tech companies will actually come to the region, open an office, and hire people. Incentives alone cannot guarantee it, though they may stimulate it. Eliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is too extreme by using \"always,\" which is too absolute and does not account for possible exceptions where tech companies might not improve the economy, possibly due to mismatched industry needs and local resources or during a tech crisis such as a dot com bust in 2000’s. Answer choices with “Always” in them will “usually” be wrong as they are too extreme. Eliminate.\n\n\n\nThis answer introduces an idea about the lack of skilled labor, which was not mentioned in the initial statements. We do not know what kind of labor composition is in the economically depressed regions. Possibly that may be true that there is a lack of skilled labor but how would government incentives help with skilled labor? That's really a shot in the dark. There is no way to prove that 2 of these statements bundled into one are true.

Here is the explanation:\n\nMost large nurseries sell raspberry plants with two conditions:\n- primarily to commercial raspberry growers \n- only plants that are guaranteed to be disease-free\n\nHowever, Wally's plants sent Johnson diseased raspberry plants. \nSo what does this imply:\n- Perhaps Wally's plants is not a large nursery (since most large nurseries guarantee disease free plants)\n- If Wally's plants is a large  nursery, Johnson may be a commercial raspberry grower (since large nurseries supply primarily to commercial growers)\n- If Wally's plant is a large nursery, Johnson probably did not receive what he was guaranteed (since most large nurseries guarantee disease free plants)\netc\n\n(A) If Johnson is a commercial raspberry grower and Wally’s Plants is not a large nursery, then the shipment of raspberry plants that Johnson received was probably guaranteed to be disease-free.\n- If Wally's Plants is not a large nursery, ... - everything after this is pointless to our discussion. \nWe only know about what to expect is Wally's plants is a large nursery. We don't know how \"not large nurseries\" behave. So irrelevant.\n\n(B) Johnson is probably not a commercial raspberry grower if the shipment of raspberry plants that Johnson received from Wally’s Plants was not entirely as it was guaranteed to be.\n- It doesn't matter whether Johnson is a commercial raspberry grower or not. Most large nurseries sell disease free plants only.  \nWe are not given that they sell disease free plants to commercial growers. They sell disease free plants, full stop.\n\n(C) If Johnson is not a commercial raspberry grower, then Wally’s Plants is probably not a large nursery.\nIf Johnson is not a commercial grower ... - we don't know anything about how non-commercial growers work. So I will let it be for the time being since the argument doesn't tell me anything about them. \n\n(D) Wally’s Plants is probably not a large, well-run nursery if it sells its raspberry plants primarily to commercial raspberry growers.\nNot correct. If it sells primarily to commercial buyers, I cannot say whether Wally's Plants is a large nursery or not. I don't know anything about how small nurseries sell. I anyway know that large nurseries sell primarily to commercial buyers. Hence there is no way I can imply that if it sells to commercial buyers, it is NOT a large nursery.\n\n(E) If Wally’s Plants is a large nursery, then the raspberry plants that Johnson received in the shipment were probably not entirely as they were guaranteed to be.\nMost large nurseries guarantee disease free plants. If Wally's is large, it probably guaranteed disease free plants. So Johnson probably did not receive the plants as per guarantee.

However, it is said that she recently returned to her home country. Her work has now lost its charm for the people  of her home country who find the content very recognizable. The critic suggests that she leave the country so that she can recapture her old style of writing.\n\nThis whole argument is based on the fact that the change has come due to the fact that her personal experiences and  surroundings etc have changed.  The critic assumes that if she leaves the country, her work might bring back its lost charm. Option B suggests exactly this. Here the term \"autobiographically inspired\" means that her work is inspired from personal experiences and life. An autobiography is written by someone describing  his/her own life. Hence, this term means that her books are inspired from her personal experiences etc.\n\nOn the other hand. A states that the critic's opinion is shared by most of Bateman's readers. Can this be inferred based on the argument? No. The critic suggests that one feels she should leave the country. However, we cannot be sure of  whether her readers might agree on this. Some might agree. However, can we say that most  of her readers agree. The problem with this option mainly lies with the usage of \"most\".

An unusual nucleomorph, a structure that contains DNA and resembles a cell nucleus, has been discovered within a plant known as a chlorarachniophyte. Two versions of a particular gene have been found in the DNA of this nucleomorph, and one would expect to find only a single version of this gene if the nucleomorph were not the remains of an engulfed organism’s nucleus. \n\nWhich one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?\n",

        "explanation": "The stimulus can be intimidating because it contains several formidable scientific terms, but as usual these terms are explained as the stimulus progresses. Let us take a moment to recap the information in this problem. The stimulus begins by defining endosymbiosis, which is when one organism engulfs another such that the “conquered” organism still functions. Next, we are told that a nucleomorph—a DNA-containing, nucleus-like structure—has been discovered in a plant known as a chlorarachniophyte. As the last sentence begins we are told that this nucleomorph contains two versions of a particular gene. The remainder of the final sentence is the key to the problem and it illustrates how the test makers force students to maintain an awareness of conditional indicators. The conditional relationship in the final sentence is contained in the following section of text: “one would expect to find only a single version of this gene if the nucleomorph were not the remains of an engulfed organism’s nucleus.” In the middle of this section of text the word “if” appears, and produces the following conditional relationship: R = nucleomorph is the remains of an engulfed organism’s nucleus, 1 = find only a single version of this gene ~R—&gt;1. However, as we know from our discussion of the last sentence, there was not a single version of the gene but two versions. This is equivalent to the necessary condition not occurring: ~1. Combining the two above diagrams, if the necessary condition does not occur, then the contrapositive is enacted and we can conclude that the sufficient condition does not occur: R. We can see the contrapositive in action more clearly if we link the two conditions in an arrow diagram: ~1—&gt;R. In GMAT problems, the contrapositive is often introduced in this fashion, where a premise is given that contains both a sufficient and necessary condition, and then the necessary condition is denied. Adding those two pieces together produces a conclusion via the contrapositive that the sufficient condition cannot occur, as the following summary reveals: Premise 1: ~R—&gt;1, Premise 2: 1. Conclusion: R. Premise 2 and the conclusion link together in the traditional contrapositive relationship we have seen previously: ~1—&gt;R. Thus, the contrapositive produces the inference that the nucleomorph is the remains of an engulfed organism’s nucleus. With this information in hand, we can combine some of the other elements in the stimulus. Given that the nucleomorph is part of the chlorarachniophyte and is the remains of an engulfed organism’s nucleus, we have strong evidence that the chlorarachniophyte came about as the result of endosymbiosis (the engulfing \nof one organism by another).  \n\nAnswer choice (A): This is an exaggerated answer: the word “only” at the beginning of the answer choice is too strong, and there is no evidence in the stimulus to suggest that a conditional relationship exists between endosymbiosis and nucleomorphs. \n\nAnswer choice (B): This is also an exaggerated answer: the word “all” in the middle of the answer choice is too strong. \n\nAnswer choice (C): The stimulus discusses one unusual nucleomorph whereas the answer choice attempts to make a general statement about all nucleomorphs. As such, the answer choice exaggerates the situation and is incorrect. Note that the first three answer choices in this problem all exaggerate some aspect of the stimulus. This is not surprising: in a stimulus with complex terminology, the test makers wisely attempt to prey upon that difficulty by presenting answers that have a degree of truth but go just a bit too far. These answer choices are attractive to a test taker who fails to lock down the facts of the stimulus. \n\nAnswer choice (D): This answer choice is similar to answer choice (A), and is incorrect for similar reasons: no conditional relationship is established where nucleomorphs are necessary for endosymbiosis.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

That's too much of a time gap. What if this year, the revenue has anyway gone up? \nNote that the conclusion is based on \"increase in total sales\". There is no distinction between transactions of less than 10 gallons and more than 10 gallons. \n\nWhat would help us evaluate this conclusion?\n\nThe only relevant options are (A) and (C) so let's look at them.\n\n(A) In the areas in which XT’s gasoline stations operate, how did total combined gasoline sales for all gasoline stations last August compare with sales for the previous August? \n\nThis questions whether the overall gasoline revenue has seen arise this time. \n- Say combined gasoline sales for all stations this time is 10% more than the previous August. Then most gasoline stations would have seen this 10% rise in August sales. Hence the promotion would have had no impact.\n- Say combined gasoline sales for all stations this time is no more than the previous August. Then we can say with more certainty that the promotion has had impact.\nHence how we answer this question affects our conclusion. \n\n(C) Were there any customers who bought ten or more gallons at an XT gasoline station during the promotion who would have or more gallons at an XT gasoline in lower quantities, but more frequently, if the promotion had not been in effect? \n\nHere is the reason this is not helpful to evaluate. The station is trying to increase its overall revenue - whether it is through 10 gallons sales or fewer gallons sale is immaterial. The overall sales has increased. \nWhen we compare customers who bought 10 or more gallons fewer times compared to earlier when they bought the SAME amount of fuel but by visiting more frequently, it doesn't impact the station. These people are today also buying  that they were buying a year ago. Whether they did it in small amounts or one big, it doesn't impact the success of the promotion at all. What impacts is whether there are people who were not buying at this station or were buying less total amount in the month before but are now buying higher amount. That is what we need to evaluate.

        "question": "If the appropriate timely surgery is not performed on someone who has suffered from appendicitis, the outcome can be potentially fatal; consequently, patients with symptoms strongly suggesting appendicitis are almost always made to undergo a surgery, whether they have actually had appendicitis or not. The appropriate surgery is extremely low-risk but is performed unnecessarily in about 20 percent of all cases. A newly developed internal scan to determine whether someone with symptoms of appendicitis has actually had appendicitis produces absolutely correct diagnosis in 98% of the cases. Clearly, using this scan, doctors can largely avoid unnecessary surgeries related to appendicitis, without, however, performing any fewer necessary surgeries. \n\nWhich of the following assumption is required for the conclusion to be always true?\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "Such a great question--it requires care with the exact terms of the conclusion, as  of the hardest CR questions do, so start there (OR ELSE): the conclusion promises that doctors can  (but not necessarily ) avoid unnecessary appendicitis surgeries without performing  fewer necessary surgeries. The issue with the premise supporting the conclusion is that it says that the new test only correctly diagnoses appendicitis in 98% of the cases. This raises a question: if the test isn't perfectly accurate, should you trust its results at all? How can you guarantee that  necessary surgeries still get performed?\n\nWhen it comes to accuracy in testing, it's important to know whether the test, when wrong, will yield a false positive result (that is, the person is not sick but the test says he or she is), a false negative result (the person is sick but the test says he or she isn't), or both at various times. If you need this test to ensure what the conclusion promises--that even though the test is only 98% accurate, doctors will still not perform --then the test needs to diagnose 100% of the people for whom the surgery is necessary. That means that the test needs to show a positive result  a person has appendicitis. Of course, you know that the test is only 98% accurate, so the only way to know for sure that nobody who  the surgery will fall through the cracks is if the 2% of inaccurate tests are all false positives; that is, the test correctly catches all cases that are actually positive, but in about 2% of cases, it also comes out positive when the person in fact does not have appendicitis. That will lead to  unnecessary surgeries, to be sure, but go back to the conclusion: it only promises that unnecessary surgeries will be  reduced. That will still be achieved in this case, as this test will reduce the current 20% rate of unnecessary surgeries to presumably something that's 2% or less.\n\nA. the misdiagnoses produced by this scan are always instances of attributing appendicitis to someone who has not had it\n needing the surgery. Winning time. false positives, then they must  be false negatives. These false negatives, if taken as true negatives, will lead to necessary surgeries  being performed, which contradicts the conclusion. No thanks, (B). Get lost. implies that the person being tested should have gotten a positive result rather than a negative one. These people will sadly slip through the cracks in this case, and their appendices might kill them (thanks for nothing, horror test). More importantly, this means that doctors will be performing fewer necessary surgeries than they should, so this hurts the conclusion.) but doesn't say anything important with them. Whether the people have symptoms at all (leaving aside the  part for the moment) is irrelevant to this conclusion--you just need the test to be as accurate as possible, even in the absence of symptoms. And there's certainly no reason to believe that people who show up positive on the test should always need to have  of the symptoms anyway.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, , and  Instructor",

You need to find an answer choice that provides information that resolves the discrepancy/paradox and allows them to both be true at the same time.\n\nIn this case we are told that judicial opinions are not of high literary quality because judicial opinions are used to determine law and writing of high literary quality can be misinterpreted (we don't want laws to be misinterpreted).

        "question": "Last year, after the number of subway riders who had had their pockets picked at Central Station had risen to an all-time high, the transit authority erected signs in Central Station telling riders to beware of pickpockets. In the year since the signs have been erected, though, riders have had their pockets picked at Central Station at a per-capita rate nearly double that before the signs were erected.\n \nWhich of the following, if true, helps to explain the discrepancy pointed out in the passage?\n\t",
        "answer": "Edited the post",
        "explanation": "Hey guys,\n\nI agree that you have to make some assumptions about C--something that might help with this one is knowing that you *almost always* have to make some assumptions (unless you are in one of those rare, lsat-like questions with more formal logic).  It's more accurate to think of the real question here as what \"explains\" the discrepancy...meaning--which of the choices requires the assumptions? It's all relative.\n\nThe discrepancy that we're trying to address is \n\nI won't go into all the choices, since the original poster copied the explanation. The main contention in this thread seems to be between A-B-C, so let's assume we got rid of D and E and deal with these.\n\nAs a couple of posters mentioned above, ** is a huge red flag phrase here. That means the number of pickpocketed people divided by the total number of people, doubled. This could happen a number of ways, so let's use a number to help make the situation tangible--100 people, and 10 are pickpocketed per day, so there's an original per capita pickpocket rate of .\n\n(1) if the total population stays the same--100 people, but the rate doubles to 0.2, or 20 people, that means that out of a (fictionalized) 100 people, 10 of the people who were NOT pickpocketed before ARE pickpocketed now.\n\n(2) if the total population increased--let's say, it increased by 100%, so we now have people. In order for the rate to double to 0.2, we would need 20% of the new total population (200 people), or  people, to be pickpocketed after the signs go up. Notice you had to increase the number of pickpocketed people by more than two, to compensate for the ratio increase AND population increase.\n\n(3) if the total population decreased--let's say, to 50 people.  The per capita pickpocket rate we're aiming for is 0.2, and 20% of 50 is 10, so 10 people still get pickpocketed, but there are only 50 people total, so the only people who left the original population were non-pickpocketed people.\n\n\nChoice (A) says that the station has become much more attractive to tourists since the signs were posted during a recent renovation. Now in general, it's a good idea to be of assumptions that fall into ; the test-writers know many common \"real world\" broad assumptions, and will use that to trap people. There is a broad stereotype about tourists being easy targets. But even if that were true (assumption 1) AND tourists are TWICE as likely to get pickpocketed (assumption 2) we'd have to make another assumption (no.3) about the rest of the population balancing out in a way to result in our desired statistic.  That's the long version--the short version is that COMMON STEREOTYPES THAT ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY JUSTIFIED IN THE ARGUMENT should be targets of as you go through choices. There isn't a necessary causal link between being a tourist and being an easy target--I, for one, am super paranoid and careful when I travel and have never (knock on wood) been pickpocketed while traveling, though I have in my home city! \n\nChoice (B) doesn't necessarily help us because the phase \"\" is in the argument. Look at situation #2 above-- if the traffic doubles, but the rate of pickpocketing is the same, the per capita rate doesn't change. In our example above with the population of 100 and a 100% increase in population, the rate of pickpocketing would have to quadruple to give us a doubled per capita rate.\n\nChoice (C) does involve some assumptions,yes-- that the pickpocketers will pay attention to the rummaging going on and use it to their advantage. But this is not a terribly illogical assumption to make, since their goal is to pickpocket people, and these people are behaving in an obvious way that would assist that goal. \n\nHope this helps. Remember that correct/incorrect on verbal can seem relative, which is why you should ALWAYS go through all the answers and eliminate what's definitely wrong (or has the most problems) rather than trying to find the perfect answer.",

It is true that automobile manufactures’ share of the industry’s revenues fell from 65 percent two years ago to 50 percent today, but over the same period suppliers of automobile parts had their share increase from 15 percent to 20 percent and service companies (for example, distributors, dealers, and repairers) had their share increase from 20 percent to 30 percent.\n\nWhich one of the following best indicates why the statistics given above provide by themselves no evidence for the conclusion they are intended to support?\n\n",

Which is sad, because everyone deserves their own dosa, and I would really like to magically increase the size of any dosa that I see.\n\nGetting back to the argument, the author's evidence of how the total revenue is broken down tells us nothing about whether overall industry revenues have declined. As a result, they don't really support the author's conclusion. The correct answer choice will match this observation.\n\nThe reason why this conclusion is poorly founded is  the source of evidence. The prompt states plainly that the % figures are true, and nothing in the argument depends on proving that the sources of these figures are trustworthy. \n\nMost importantly, we're not asked to pick the choice that would create the maximum amount of arbitrary doubt. We are asked to analyze the logic of the author's argument and pick the choice that shows why the author's evidence does not support the author's intended conclusion.

Since the rest of the housing market - cheap homes to average priced homes - is not doing as well, the average price of homes sold is going to increase. Even if the number of expensive homes sold remained the same, the average price would still increase if the number of medium-priced homes sales decreased. \n\nIn answer (C), we are no longer dealing with averages but with number of units sold.

        "question": "After the publication of Origin of Species, Charles Darwin sent a copy to his friend and former tutor Adam Sedgwick, an early geologist who strenuously opposed the idea of natural selection. Sedgwick’s response to Darwin was both cautious and kind: he encouraged his friend and one-time pupil to beware of embracing natural selection and claimed that the theory had no scientific proof to back it up. In a later letter to another friend, however, Sedgwick was far more candid about his views. He claimed to be appalled by Darwin’s theories and stated forthrightly that they were, without a doubt, untrue and even dangerous.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage, which of the following best accounts for the difference in tone between Sedgwick’s letter to Darwin and his later letter to a friend?\n\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Question records an account of Charles Darwin’s relationship with his friend and former tutor Adam Sedgwick, particularly after the publication of Darwin’s Origin of Species. Sedgwick was not a supporter of natural selection, a theory that Darwin developed and propounded in Origin of Species. (The student should note that this is not stated outright but is implied in the statement, “…he encouraged his friend and one-time pupil to beware of embracing natural selection,” which suggests the topic of Darwin’s book.) In writing to Darwin, Sedgwick’s response was “both cautious and kind,” and he warned Darwin against the theory. When he wrote to another friend about the book, however, Sedgwick chose stronger words and vehemently opposed Darwin’s theories as “untrue and even dangerous.” The question then asks the student to identify an answer choice that explains—based on the information in the passage—why Sedgwick’s response to Darwin was less candid. The student should recognize immediately that there is a limited amount of information in the passage to account for the differences in Sedgwick’s remark. The passage claims that Sedgwick “strenuously opposed” natural selection and that he was a “friend and former tutor” to Darwin. This leaves the student with only two real options: (1) Sedgwick was so opposed to the theory of natural selection that he shared his feelings honestly with his friend, or (2) Sedgwick always opposed the idea but still respected Darwin as a friend and former student and thus felt the need to maintain that respect despite the different opinion. Option 1 provides an explanation in part, while option 2 provides an explanation in full. The correct answer should reflect the second option.\n\n\n\nD Based on the information provided in the Overview above, answer choice (D) best explains Sedgwick’s different comments to Darwin. As a personal friend and as a one-time figure of authority to Darwin, Sedgwick was concerned about using that position to express his full criticism of Darwin’s theory. Answer choice (D) is correct.\n\n\n\nA Answer choice (A) would only be a good explanation if the passage had provided enough information to justify it. As it stands, however, the author of the passage is silent on the question of Sedgwick’s ability to flatter. Answer choice (A) assumes too much, therefore it is incorrect.\n\nB Again, answer choice (B) assumes information that cannot possibly be inferred from the information in the passage, so it should be eliminated at once.\n\nC Answer choice (C) is tricky, because it provides a perfectly valid situation: Sedgwick might have written to Darwin initially with a tone of kindness but grew more frustrated over time and vented his irritation to a friend. The problem with this, however, is that the passage does not explain how much time elapsed between the letter to Darwin and the letter to the unnamed friend. It was simply “later,” which could have been a matter of hours, days, weeks, and so forth. What is more, the passage does not contain enough detail to suggest that Sedgwick’s feelings about the theory grew more strongly in opposition over time. In fact, the author of the passage makes it clear from the start that Sedgwick always opposed the theory of natural selection, so the reader cannot infer that he grew increasingly upset about it. Answer choice (C) cannot be correct.\n\nE The author of the passage provides no information about Darwin’s response (if any) to Sedgwick’s letter, so it is impossible to infer what Sedgwick’s reaction to such might have been. Answer choice (E) is clearly incorrect, so it may be eliminated.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

This seems counterintuitive because one might expect that restrictions on internet content would deter usage.\n\nWhich of the following, if true and known by the residents of these countries, would best help explain the paradoxical results of the survey?\n",

        "explanation": "in prizes such as Courses, Tests, Private Tutoring, \n        \n        \n    \n\n­\n\n \n\nThis option resolves the paradox by suggesting that despite high levels of censorship, residents find ways to circumvent these restrictions using technology like VPNs and proxy servers. This allows them to access content freely, thus maintaining or even increasing internet usage rates, because they can circumvent the sensorship online, which cannot be circumvented in other channels such as print, TV, or radio content. This answer is also one of the only ones that fits into the condition identified in the question \"if true and known by the residens of these countries\" - if you read that element of the question carefully, this answer choice would likely jump out at you more than others such as C for example talking about vague measurement differences.\n\n\n\n\nThis answer choice does not resolve the paradox of high personal or leisure use in the face of censorship. It ignores how censorship impacts broader internet usage habits beyond work-related activities. This also makes the paradox less explained because it implies that the internet is used primarily for work-related purposes and thus should result in less usage per capita as it would not be used as much in non-working hours for leisure. Eliminate.\n\n\n\nThis option is deliberately confusing and unclear and is also a trap.  This choice introduces ambiguity rather than clarifying the paradox. We do not know if the \"vary significantly between surveyed regions\" varies one way or another - you may assume this explains but we only know it varied. We are also not sure how indirect engagement would be explaining the paradox and what is even indirect engagement? When an answer choice is vague like this, and asks you to come out of your comfort zone to nail you in the end, it is very likey incorrect. Eliminate cuatiously.\n\n\n\nA larger population does not explain higher per capita internet usage under censorship. This choice is mixing apples and oranges. Eliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice suggests a possible skew in the survey data, which might misrepresent actual usage patterns across the entire population and it would impact all of the usage in censored and uncensored countries. However, this issue with survey data would impact both censored and unsensored countries, so the net impact would be zero (both areas surveyed would have large number of young people) and would not explain the paradox.

A new mall has a lot of economic activity but overall the local economy does not show this increased activity. The new activity should add to the previous activity and show the same increase in the economic activities of the local economy. \n\n(A) When large shopping malls are new they attract a lot of shoppers but once the novelty has worn off they usually attract fewer shoppers than does the traditional downtown shopping district.\n\nWe are talking about the case of newly opened malls. What happens later is irrelevant. \n\n(B) Most of the money spent in a large shopping mall is spent by tourists who are drawn specifically by the mall and who would not have visited the community had that mall not been built.\n\nThis says that the mall brings in new economic activity. This should increase the overall local economy's activity too. It doesn't explain the paradox.\n\n(C) Most of the jobs created by large shopping malls are filled by people who recently moved to the community and who would not have moved had there been no job offer in the community.\n\nMore people coming in to get more jobs would mean more economic activity. This should show in the local economy's activity too.\n\n(D) Most of the money spent in a large shopping mall is money that would have been spent elsewhere in the same community had that mall not been built.\n\nThis tells us that the economic activity of the mall was just the economic activity that was happening elsewhere in the same community before. So if people were buying clothes from the local store before, now they are buying from the mall and not from the local store.

        "question": "In 1963, Congress approved the Community Mental Health Centers Act, which outlined plans to release the mentally ill from institutions, incorporate these individuals into their communities, and provide outpatient treatment. Leading associations of mental health professionals overwhelmingly applauded these goals and approved of these plans because, the experts said, the treatment rather than the institutional environment was the crucial element for the welfare of these patients. Within twenty years, state authorities succeeded in discharging 95% of these patients from institutional care. In 1983, however, executives from these same professional associations said that the plight of the mentally ill was worse than ever. \n\nWhich if the following, if true, best resolves the paradox in the above passage?\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "Hi, I'm happy to talk about this.  \n\nDischarging them is a great idea, IF they get the outpatient treatment, which could help them more than remaining locked in an institution.  So, if the treatment could help them so much, why weren't they helped?  \n\n\n\nThe passage is about a mass of patients, who had be diagnosed and locked in institutions over the course of years, perhaps decades.  It's not just about the folks diagnosed in a single calendar year.  \n\n\n\nThe question is: why didn't the outpatient treatment help these patients as expected --- that part  have been administered by mental health professionals, so this statement is somewhat beside the point.  \n\n\n\nOK, this is getting there . . maybe the money for the programs wasn't keeping up with inflation, so the dollars allocated didn't go as far as they should have.  Not bad.  \n\n\n\nIn other words, they never came up with the money, so the patients never got the outpatient treatments that theoretically would have been helpful to them.  Bingo!  That would precisely explain why, 20 years later, the mental ill folks were worse off than ever --- they had been kicked out of their state-sponsored institutions, given no help with services, and left to fend for themselves.  Historically, this is exactly what happened in California, when then-Governor Reagan signed the bill to close all those state-run institutions, a huge budget cut, and while all kinds of outpatient care were promised, in practice not a dime was allocated toward them.  The vast majority of the mentally ill became homeless, and are still so today, thanks to those decisions now almost half-a-century old.  \n\n\n\nAn aggravating factor, to be sure, but it doesn't explain the wholesale failure of the promised and promising outpatient treatments.  \n\nThe best resolution of the paradox is what, in real history, actually happened.  The outpatient services, however potentially beneficial, didn't help these released mentally ill folks because they never received those services.  Super-helpful treatment programs were promised in political grandstanding, but never supported with any money, and the homeless, kicked of the state-run institutions, were left on the street with no care.  \n\nBest answer = \n\nBTW, here's a blog article I wrote about paradox questions:  \n\n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)",

        "question": "When so many oysters died off the coast of Britain that some native species were threatened with extinction, the fact that the water temperature had recently risen was at first thought to be the cause. Later, however, the cause was determined to be the chemical tributyl tin (TBT), used to keep barnacles off the hulls of boats. Legislation that banned TBT has nearly eliminated that chemical from British waters, yet the populations of the endangered oyster species have not grown. \n\nWhich one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the failure of the native oyster populations to recover? \n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "We are presented with a scenario in which  and the cause of the die off was determined to be , but even though TBT has been , the .\n\n\n\nThe correct answer will explain why the oyster populations haven't recovered even though the cause of the decline has been eliminated.\n\n\n\nThis choice is incorrect for two reasons.\n\nOne is that the information in the passage indicates that the increase in the water temperature did NOT cause the population decline.\n\nThe second is that the fact that the increase in water temperature slowed means that the situation changed more slowly. A decrease in the rate of a change in the situation would not be the reason for the development of a new issue such as that the populations didn't recover even though TBT was eliminated.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe passage does not mention lack of food as the cause of the death of oysters, or barnacles. What's mentioned as a cause of the death of both is TBT.\n\nSo, we can eliminate this choice as off topic.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nTo see why this choice explains the mystery of why the populations haven't recovered, we need to identify the factors at play and make common-sense, logical connections.\n\nWhat we can see is that, if TBT killed imported varieties of oysters that flourish at the expense of native oysters now that the waters are warmer, then with the elimination of TBT, those imported varieties of oysters can now flourish. As a result, with the elimination of one cause of the native oyster population decline, TBT, another cause of native oyster population problems came into play that offset the elimination of TBT, imported oysters.\n\nThe fact that such an offset occurred perfectly explains why, even though TBT has been nearly eliminated, the native oyster populations haven't recovered.\n\nA key takeaway from this choice is that, to get CR questions correct, we need to read choices in their entirety. After all, if we focus on just the first part of this choice, \"TBT also killed imported varieties of oysters,\" we could easily decide that this choice is an irrelevant statement about oysters other than the ones we're concerned with.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThis choice eliminates an alternative cause that could have kept the oyster populations from recovering, other chemicals still used that harm oysters.\n\nSo, this choice actually deepens the mystery of why the populations haven't recovered.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is clearly out.\n\nFor one thing, TBT has been nearly eliminated. So, presumably, TBT isn't a factor at this point. \n\nFurthermore, the passage indicates that the waters have become warmer. So, according to this choice, TBT should be less deadly than before.\n\nA key thing to notice about this choice is how it mentions two things from the passage, warmer waters and TBT, to give the vibe of having something to do with the mystery we need to explain and thus tempt us to choose it.\n\nEliminate.\n\nThe correct answer is (C).",

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "This is testing the converse and contrapositive, which is something tested far more often on the LSAT than on the GMAT. Here the argument says \"If a doctor does not answer questions, that doctor is not competent\". If we just negate both of those clauses, to get \"If a doctor does answer questions, that doctor is competent\", then we're taking the converse of the original sentence. The converse is not generally a correct logical deduction -- \"if x = 3, then x  0\" is clearly true, but the converse, \"if x is not equal to 3, x is negative\" clearly does not need to be true. What is always true is the \"contrapositive\" -- we must negate both clauses, but also reverse their order: \"If a doctor is competent, that doctor answers questions\" is a logically correct inference from the statements in this question, and \"If x &lt; 0, then x is not equal to 3\" is a logically correct inference from the mathematical example I give above.\n\nSo here, we want an answer choice that is in the same form as the original argument: the premise must read \"If X is true, then Y is true\", and the conclusion must falsely read \"X is not true, so Y is not true\". Most answer choices here start \"If X is true then Y is true\" and conclude with \"X is true, therefore...\" so most are wrong for that reason alone. But D is a match: \"If someone has two jobs, they cannot find balance\" becomes, if we take the (logically invalid) converse \"If someone does not have two jobs, they can find balance\".\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "City resident: These new digital electronic billboards should be banned for light pollution since they are much too bright.\n\nOutdoor advertising spokesperson: No, that's not true. Testing with a sophisticated light meter shows that at night they throw off less light than traditional billboards that are reflectively lit. Your mistaken perception that they are brighter comes from looking directly at the light source—the screen itself.\n\nThe underlying strategy of the spokesperson's response to the resident is most analogous to the underlying strategy of which of the following?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "- The city resident suggests that the new digital electronic billboards be banned. The reason is that they cause light pollution (meaning pollution of light) since they are too bright.\n\n - The OAS challenges the city resident directly by saying what the resident has stated is not true. (the new billboards are not too bright, and thus do not cause light pollution.)\n\n - OAS supports his challenge by citing data from a sophisticated light meter. The meter shows that the new electronic billboards throw less light than traditional billboards that are reflectively lit (here’s an indication that the new digital billboards are not reflectively lit)\n\n - OAS says that the resident’s misperception (that the new digital billboards are brighter than the traditional ones) arises since the resident looks directly at the light source i.e. the screen. (If the resident had not looked at the screen directly and instead focussed on the light ‘thrown off’, he might have correctly observed that the new digital billboards are less bright than the traditional ones)\n\nThe options are going to present strategies followed by different persons while dealing with certain situations. We have to find an option that presents a strategy most analogous to the strategy of the OAS’s response to the resident. What is the strategy of OAS? He counters the resident’s claim by citing a fact (meter reading) and by presenting an alternate reason (other than the reason that the new digital billboards are brighter) for the resident’s perception.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Your mistaken perception that they are brighter comes from …” – The subject for the verb ‘comes’ is ‘your mistaken perception’. As is quite common, a phrase (and even a clause) can very well act as a subject.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "Since 1978 when the copyright law was changed, books that are less than fifty years old must not be photocopied without the publisher's permission. Thus, any book that has been photocopied since 1978 without the publisher's permission must be at least fifty years old.\n\nThe reasoning above exhibits a flaw similar to one in which of the following?\n",
        "answer": "Edited the question.",
        "explanation": "The most helpful first step in this situation is to identify the flaw in the reasoning given in the passage and then proceed to eliminate answers based on whether they exhibit a similar flaw. Consider the logic of the passage:\n\n (LEGALLY) not be photocopied without permission. Any book copied without permission since 1978  (NECESSARILY) be at least 50 years old.\nThe argument assumes that because books less than 50 years old are not LEGALLY allowed to be photocopied, they NECESSARILY are not photocopied. But just because there is a man-made law prohibiting something does not mean that everyone follows that law. So, the logical error committed by the passage is assuming that the presence of a man-made law means that particular law is ALWAYS followed.\n\nWith that in mind, consider (A):\n\n(A) is tricky. The law under consideration is that every member of the solar system must (NECESSARILY, ) be a planet or moon. It then concludes that because an asteroid does not satisfy this condition, it is not a member of the solar system. (A) is incorrect because it confuses  law with  law. Natural law is something that, according to science, NECESSARILY be followed. That’s different than saying something must LEGALLY be followed. For that reason, (A) does not contain the same logical error as the passage, and we can eliminate it.\n\nNow here’s (C):\n\n(C) first identifies a man-made law: any driver who turns right must (LEGALLY) signal. Then, it assumes that that law is always (NECESSARILY) followed: a driver who turns right ALWAYS signals and thus a driver who DOES NOT signal DID NOT turn right. This is precisely the same logical error (assuming that because something is LEGALLY required it is NECESSARILY required) as is committed in the passage. Let’s keep (C).\n\nAnd here’s (D):\n\nAgain, (D) first states a man-made law:  crossing a national boundary requires a passport. But it does not assume that this law is ALWAYS followed. Instead, it suggests that to ignore this law is ILLEGAL. Because (D) qualifies its conclusion with the word “legally”, it allows for the possibility that people break the law (and cross national boundaries illegally) and thus does not commit the same logical error as the passage. Eliminate (D).\n\n(C) is the best answer choice.\n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

In fact, this belief was a consequence of his early experiences with an admired older sister who always made fun of his ambitions and achievements. In light of this explanation, therefore, Arnold’s stubborn belief that his colleagues were duplicitous emerges as clearly justified.\n\nThe flawed reasoning in the biographer’s argument is most similar to that in which one of the following?\n\n",

Just boil the argument down to its parts. 1) Arnold believes something. 2) There is an understandable cause or explanation for this irrational belief. Conclusion: The belief is justified. Using this abstraction will make the question much easier.\n\nAnswer choice (A): This answer choice actually move in the opposite direction of the stimulus. Here, a general fact is given about the world (something not present in the stimulus) and this fact is used to explain why a belief is justified. In the stimulus, the fact that there is an explanation, a cause of the belief, justifies the belief.\n\nAnswer choice (B): The initial part of this answer seems to match, but then a fact about the world, \"evidence\" is offered to justify her belief. The cause of the belief is not used to justify it.\n\nAnswer choice (C): This is the correct answer choice, as this choice matches perfectly because Joan's belief is justified by an understandable explanation, not by any facts. The order of presentation is reversed, but the reasoning is the same. 1) There is an understandable cause or explanation for an irrational belief. 2) Joan has a belief about cats. Conclusion: This belief is justified.\n\nAnswer choice (D): The first word should tell you that this is an incorrect answer. This answer, like A and B, does not pass the Premise Test. There are no general facts about the world from \"studies,\" \"evidence\" or general knowledge in the stimulus.\n\nAnswer choice (E): This answer choice deviates entirely from the reasoning of the stimulus but does offer a similarly worded conclusion.

This is saying, X has Y, therefore it must have Z. \n\nD) Correct. \n\nX (Airplanes) are able to Z (fly), X (Airplanes) have Y (aerodynamic shape), which is linked to Z (flying), therefore X (Airplanes) having (aerodynamic shape) is why they are able to Z (fly).

Yet the fact is that not only were more jobs created than were eliminated, but the average pay for these new jobs has been higher than the average pay for jobs citywide every year since Delmont took office. So there can be no question that throughout Delmont's tenure the average paycheck in this city has been getting steadily bigger.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument in the advertisement?\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of this political ad is that \"there can be no question that throughout {Mayor Delmont's} tenure the average paycheck in this city has been getting steadily bigger.\" Before we look for an answer choice that strengthens the argument, let's make sure we clearly understand the ad's reasoning:\n\n of jobs while Delmont was mayor.We know that the average pay for the new jobs was higher than the average pay for jobs citywide each year since Delmont took office. Choice (A) simply tells us that the average pay for the new jobs created during the past three years was higher than the average pay for the new jobs created earlier in the mayor's tenure. So the average pay for the new jobs went up, but what about the average paycheck citywide? Has that been increasing as well? What if the average pay of the LOST jobs exceeded the average pay of the NEW jobs each year? We still can't determine whether the OVERALL average increased or decreased, so (A) doesn't strengthen (or weaken) the argument. \n\nThe average pay was at a ten-year low when Delmont took office, but what happened AFTER he took office? For example, say that Delmont's term began in 2007. Average pay may have steadily DECLINED from 1997 to 2007, so in 2007 average pay would have been at a ten-year low. Did the average pay then increase or did it continue to decrease? Choice (B) doesn't tell us either way, so it doesn't strengthen or weaken the argument. Eliminate (B).\n\nWe already know that there has been a net increase in the NUMBER of jobs since the mayor has taken office. This is true regardless of whether choice (C) is true. Either way, we still don't know whether the average paycheck in the city has increased or decreased because we don't know anything about the average pay of the lost jobs. (C) doesn't impact the argument and can be eliminated.\n\n \nThe ad compares the average pay of the NEW jobs to the average pay of jobs citywide. But how does the average pay of the new jobs compare to the average pay of the jobs that were lost? What if the average pay of the jobs lost was HIGHER than the average pay of the new jobs? In that case, there would have been a net DECREASE in average pay citywide, contradicting the conclusion of the ad.\n\nChoice (D) assures us that this is NOT the case. The average pay of the lost jobs was roughly equal to the average pay for jobs citywide. We already know that the average pay of the new jobs was greater than the average pay for jobs citywide. Given statement (D), we now know that the average pay of the new jobs must also have been greater than the average pay of the lost jobs. Choice (D) definitely strengthens the argument.\n\nWe only care about what happened to the average paycheck . How the average pay for jobs in the city compares to the average pay for jobs in the surrounding suburbs does not tell us whether the average paycheck in the city has decreased or increased. Choice (E) is not relevant to the argument in this ad and can be eliminated.\n\nChoice (D) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "Judge Brown has shown a marked preference over the past decade for sentencing criminals to make amends for their crimes—for example, by apologizing to the victim—rather than sending them to jail. He argues that the rate of recidivism, or the likelihood that the criminal will commit another offense, is only 15% when he does so, while the average rate of recidivism in the country as a whole is above 35%. Judge Brown thus argues that the criminal justice system is most effective when criminals make amends for their crime, rather than serving time.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most strongly supports Judge Brown’s claim?\n\n",

I think this answer choice actually weakens the claim because it talks about repeat offenders who may or may not have already made amends in the past which would prove the Brown's plan for amends to be ineffective? The argument doesn't talk about repeat offenders and whether these amends are just as effective for those types of offenders. I don't really understand the explanation video either.  Dear ,\nI'm happy to respond.  .\"  \nIf that view were really true, it would be devastating to Judge Brown's argument.   How do we know that the folks who went through Judge Brown's program have lowers recidivism rate because of that program and not because of some other factor about who they are?   This is the biggest objection to the prompt arguments at it stands.  \n\nChoice (A) addresses this in a powerful way.   If the folks Judge Brown sees are repeat offenders, folks that typically have a much higher recidivism rate, and after participating in Judge Brown's programs, even these hardened embittered repeat offenders are much less likely to continue their life of crime. then that's powerful.  The programs takes the population most like to repeat their offense, and makes even these people less like to repeat.  Wow!  If something works on the hardest imaginable case, then it really works!  This is why it's such a powerful strengthener for the argument.  \n\nDoes all this make sense?\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)",

        "question": "Paleontologist: Scientists have used evidence about bone structure to infer that carnivorous dinosaurs like Trynnasauraus rex had genomes - sets of genetic information in their DNA - much smaller than those of most modern mammals. Modern birds have genomes about the same size as those of carnivorous dinosaurs, from which they evolved. Therefore, the hypothesis that small genomes in birds were an evolutionary adaptation functioning to conserve energy for flight is probably false.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most strengthen the argument?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of the argument is the following:\n\n\n\nThe reasoning of the argument is basically the following. Birds evolved from dinosaurs that had small genomes. So, it's probable that the  reason birds have small genomes is not that they evolved small genomes to conserve energy but simply that they evolved from ancestors that had small genomes and thus ended up with small genomes.\n\n\n\nThis is a Strengthen question, and the correct answer will somehow help to support or confirm the conclusion.\n\n\n\nThis choice is interesting.\n\nIf species of flying animals other than birds typically have genomes no smaller than those of their most recent flightless ancestor species, then what we see is that, when animals have evolved from being flightless to flying, their genomes haven't become smaller.\n\nWhile that information doesn't prove that birds didn't evolve relatively small genomes to conserve energy for flight, it helps to support that conclusion.\n\nAfter all, if these other animals didn't evolve smaller genomes as they evolved to flying, then it could be that relatively small genomes aren't very helpful for flying.\n\nTherefore, maybe birds didn't evolve small genomes to help with flying. In that case, it's quite possible that birds' genomes are relatively small just because their ancestors' genomes were relatively small.\n\nSo, this choice helps to confirm that the conclusion of the argument is correct.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThis choice weakens the support for the conclusion.\n\nAfter all, if flying mammals such as bats have genomes about the same size as modern bird genomes, then we have other examples of flying animals with relatively small genomes. The fact that other flying animals also have relatively small genomes tends to indicate that flying animals evolve to have small genomes for some purpose that they all share, which could be to conserve energy for flight.\n\nBy supporting the conclusion that flying animals evolve to have small genomes to conserve energy for flight, this choice weakens rather than strengthens the case for the conclusion of the argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nIf anything, this choice weakens the support for the conclusion.\n\nAfter all, if this choice is true, then it make sense that birds would have evolved relatively small genomes to conserve energy for flight.\n\nOf course, by indicating that that makes sense, this choice weighs against the conciusion of the argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis information about other animal species doesn't indicate whether birds evolved relatively small genomes to conserve energy or just retained small genomes from their ancestors.\n\nAfter all, these other animals have no clear relationship with birds. They just happened to have small genomes.\n\nEliminate.\n\n \n\nIf anything, this choice slightly weakens the argument.\n\nAfter all, if this choice is true, then flightless ancestors of some birds had larger genomes than those birds have.\n\nThat information indicates that some birds evolved to have genomes that are smaller than their flightless ancestors had, which in turn tends to indicate that those birds have relatively small genomes because they fly, and thus benefit from conserving energy, whereas their ancestors didn't fly.\n\nThat train of logic goes against the conclusion of the argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n A",

If the eyes of other employees (like HR) were aware of how often the executives initiated HR meetings, the executive estimates would have been more accurate. Correct answer choices will point out this assumption. By doing so, the argument will be strengthened. Wrong will fail to strengthen the link between ideas 1 and 2.\n \nA.

        "question": "In Country X, 17 percent of the adult population has outstanding student loans. Ten years ago, the figure was 10 percent. Thus, we can conclude that many more people in Country X have taken out student loans in the last ten years than did in the previous ten years.\n\nWhich of the following statements about Country X, if true, most strengthens the support for the above conclusion?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "for the  in \n    \n\n Official Explanation:\n\nThe fact that the proportion of adults in the population has not changed as the population has declined weakens rather than strengthens the argument. After all, if the overall population has declined and the proportion of adults has not changed, then there are fewer adults in Country X than before. So, maybe fewer, rather than more, people have taken out student loans even though the percentage of adults that have loans has increased.\n\n\n\nIf the average duration of a student loan has decreased, then we’d expect people to be paying off loans faster, and we’d expect the number of student loans outstanding to decrease. Instead, the proportion of people with outstanding loans has increased. So, something must be offsetting the decrease in duration.\n\nSince one factor that could offset that decrease in duration would be an increase in the number of people taking out student loans, this choice gives us more reason to  believe that it is in fact the case that more people have taken out student loans.\n\n\n\nIf anything, this choice would be a reason to believe that fewer people are taking out student loans. After all, the government giving out grants would result in a reduced need for taking out loans.\n\n\n\nIf, as this choice says, the average size of a student loan has not decreased, then the average size has increased or remained the same. Thus, given what this choice says, it could be the case that the reason why there are more loans outstanding is that the average size has increased and that, therefore, people are taking longer to  pay them off.\n\nSince this choice leaves open the possibility that there is an alternative reason for the increase in the number of loans outstanding, it certainly does not  strengthen the argument.\n\n\n\nThis choice does not have a clear effect on the argument. In any case, the fact that the cost to attend an undergraduate program has not decreased doesn’t indicate that more people have been taking out loans.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "The SeaCare corporation is developing a new emergency inflatable raft intended to hold up to 1500 pounds of cargo while retaining buoyancy in the ocean.  The raft has a compact design before the compressed air is deployed, but once deployed in the beta test, it expanded in less than 7 seconds to its full size. In the beta test, the raft remained to float for an extended period with a dry load of 1500 pounds. Surely, if the combined weight of passengers is below 1500 lbs, this raft could keep them afloat in relatively calm ocean waters. \n\nWhich of the following would strengthen that argument, in particular, strengthen that conclusion? \n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A is out for unrelated information \nB we are not concerned about the ease of climbing into the raft from water .It may true but we are just interested in whether the raft can hold 1500 lbs in relatively calm water.\nD so we are gain not concerned about how the weight is distributed on the raft .\nE Out of scope \n\nThe official answer is C but still i am unable to relate C with the argument \nHi Dear .\"  Another that appears in choice (C) is \".\"   \n\nThink about what those definitions imply.  A substance of very low density, such as styrofoam, would float, while a substance of very high density, such as a solid block of iron, would not float--it would sink immediately.   In other words, density has something to do with buoyancy, with whether something floats.  That's the general idea of why there's a connection between (C) and the argument.  \n\nTo understand more precisely, you have to have a basic understanding of physical science--in the US, these mostly likely would be facts taught in middle school (grades 7-8).   The density of water is around 1 gram/(cm^3)--in fact, historically, that was the original motivation for the definition of the \"gram.\"  If an object has a density greater than the density of water, the object sinks in water; conversely, if an object has a density less than the density of water, the object floats in water--that is to say, it is buoyant.   More generally, an object is buoyant in a fluid floats and is buoyant in that fluid if the density of the object is less than the density of the fluid.  For example, a solid block of iron will sink in water, but it will float in a vat of mercury, the liquid metal that is even more dense than iron.   \n\nNow, let's take this understand back to the CR argument.  \n.\nFor illustration purposes, let's make up imaginary numbers.  Let's say that fresh water has a density of 1.00, and let's pretend that salt water has a density of 1.10.   Well, if the raft floated in fresh water, it had to have a density less than 1.00.  Any number less than 1.00 is definitely less than 1.10!!  (Mathematically, that property is called \"transitivity of inequality\": if M &lt; N and N &lt; P, then we know M &lt; P.)   Therefore, buoyancy in freshwater would be a strong guarantee of buoyancy in salt water.   This is why (C) strengthens the argument.  \n\nFurther real-life connections to (C): I don't know whether you have noticed that it's slightly easier to float and bob in ocean water than it is in, say, a fresh water river or lake.   The  on the Israel/Jordan border has a particularly high salt content, so much that nothing can live in that water, and correspondingly, a particularly high density, which makes floating almost effortless.  \n\nFor the GMAT CR, you don't need an expert level of knowledge, but you need to have a familiarity with what I would call the basic facts of the world: basic physical science, basic economics, basic facts about world's political &amp; judicial systems, etc. etc.  See: \n\n\nDoes all this make sense?\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)",

We can infer that the cut\nflower’s petals will therefore wilt because it gets that substance . . . but if you didn’t see this right away, all you needed to do\nwas attack the choices in search of the one that must be true.\n\nThe behaviour of insects, and what influences it, are outside the scope of this discussion of what happens to the plants\nafter (or instead of) pollination.\n\nis what we want. A cut flower, according to the last sentence, will have its mystery substance released, and according to\nsentence 2, its petals will therefore wilt in a matter of days. (Incidentally, notice that (B)’s reference to nutrients is a red\nherring since nourishment is only mentioned in terms of unpollinated flowers. Nourishment notwithstanding, cut flower petals\nwill wilt fast. Period.)\n\n Since this passage is wholly about poppy plants, there’s no conceivable way to use it to make an inference about “all\nplants.” This choice should have given you a little pause.\n\nEach of these goes far beyond the stimulus’ scope to focus on issues that might be relevant to the poppy but not to\nthe author’s set of facts.

But a real estate agent familiar with a home and its neighborhood can assess the home's true market value far more accurately than any automated Web site can. Unlike the Web sites, a real estate agent can take into account a home's intangible aesthetic factors, such as views and interior design.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, would most strengthen the real estate agent's argument?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of the real estate agent's argument is the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for that conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nThe correct answer must strengthen the support for the conclusion.\n\n\n\nThis choice strengthens the argument by indicating that taking into account intangible aesthetic factors does result in a more accurate assessment of a home's value.\n\nAfter all, the fact that \"real estate agents who take into account intangible aesthetic factors assess homes' market values far more accurately than other real estate agents do,\" allows for a comparison of the what occurs when taking into account intangible aesthetic factors is involved in assessments and what occurs when it is not involved.\n\nWe see that assessments that DO involve taking into account intangible aesthetic factors are more accurate than similar assessment that DO NOT involve taking into account intangible aesthetic factors.\n\nThus, this choice provides additional reason to believe that \"a real estate agent familiar with a home and its neighborhood can assess the home's true market value far more accurately than any automated Web site can\" by indicating that the real estate agent's taking into account intangible aesthetic factors will indeed result in an assessment more accurate than one made by a web site that does not take into account such factors.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nNotice that the conclusion of the argument is that \"a real estate agent ... CAN assess the home's true market value far more accurately.\" The conclusion is not that all real estate agents DO assess homes' true market values far more accurately than web sites.\n\nAlso, the support for that conclusion is that \"a real estate agent CAN take into account a home's intangible aesthetic factors.\"\n\nSo, the reasoning is about what CAN occur because of what a real estate agent CAN do.\n\nNow, notice that the fact stated by this choice \"most real estate agents take into account at least some intangible aesthetic factors\" does not mean that, as a result \"a real estate agent ... can assess the home's true market value far more accurately.\" In other words, the fact that real estate agents take into account intangible factors doesn't mean that taking those factors into account makes any difference.\n\nRegardless of what most real estate agents do, taking those factors into account may not make any difference.\n\nSo, this choice has no effect on the argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nIf anything, this choice weakens, rather than strengthens, the argument by showing that, even though a web site may not be able to directly evaluate intangible aesthetic factors, an assessment by a web site may still indirectly take into account such factors and thus may not be as different from one made by an agent as the argument supposes.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe fact stated by this choice doesn't indicate anything about how accurately a real estate agent can assess a home's market value. After all, what's in a home seller's interest and what a real estate agent can do are two different things.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice tempts us to choose it by mentioning \"aesthetic factors\" and thus seeming to be relevant to the argument.\n\nAt the same time, this choice certainly doesn't support the conclusion that \"a real estate agent ... can assess the home's true market value far more accurately than any automated Web site can.\"\n\nAfter all, we know from the passage that web sites do use \"recent sales prices of other homes in a neighborhood\" in assessing the values of homes. So, this choice indicates that web sites can take into account at least some intangible aesthetic factors, which indicates that real estate agents may have less of an advantage than the argument supposes they have.\n\nEliminate.\n\nThe correct answer is",

        "question": "Historians of North American architecture who have studied early nineteenth-century houses with wooden floors have observed that the boards used on the floors of bigger houses were generally much narrower than those used on the floors of smaller houses.

        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "one key on tough LR questions is to be very clear about your task, and, always, to be very clear about the conclusion.\n\nIn this case, your task is not to reinforce the idea big houses were for the rich - we know this. Your job is to strengthen the argument, which is that narrow floor boards must have been a symbol of wealth since they show up in mostly rich folks' houses.\n\nThe first gap you'd probably notice here is that there might be another reason the rich folks use those narrow floorboards--maybe they worked better structurally in big houses. Or, maybe, those rich people got rich because they were cheap! So, we need to deal with these gaps. But, there's also a lurking assumption: that using narrow floorboards is actually more expensive! We would want to validate that assumption.\n\nThe correct answer, (B), does this, albeit in a rather \"LSAT\" way, by telling us that narrow floor boards were NOT less expensive than wide floorboards. The inference here is that it would cost more to floor your house with narrow floorboards if they cost the same or more than wide ones (since you'd need more narrow ones to cover a given space).\n\nThus, as narrow floorboards, overall, are a more expensive flooring option, the idea that they are a symbol of wealth is strengthened.\n\nSee it?\n\nAs for the wrong answers:\n\n(A) weakens the argument! This is another way to explain why we see more small floorboards--it's mostly those big houses that have survived.\n\n(C) is irrelevant--the number of rooms relates to the size of the floorboards how?\n\n(D) is confusing, but essentially irrelevant. Who cares if there were some (i.e. at least one) houses with a combo of floorboards? We're talking about overall trends.\n\n(E) is very tempting! This seems to be saying \"the rich folks used more expensive flooring--so, they must have used more expensive floorboards.\" However, notice how the answer remains vague about what type of flooring was expensive. Perhaps it's referring to some marble in the foyer. That marble doesn't tell us anything about the narrow floorboards and why they're there; in fact, it just as easily could be used to show that the rich folks had blown all their money on the marble and so had to go with cheap floorboards.",

        "question": "When people evade income taxes by not declaring taxable income, a vicious cycle results. Tax evasion forces lawmakers to raise income tax rates, which causes the tax burden on nonevading taxpayers to become heavier. This, in turn, encourages even more taxpayers to evade income taxes by hiding taxable income.\n\nThe vicious cycle described above could not result unless which of the following were true?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "This passage actually starts off with the conclusion: \"When people evade income taxes by not declaring taxable income, a vicious cycle results.\"\n\nThe rest of the passage explains  this vicious cycle occurs:\n\n of whether an answer choice is true, then that answer choice should be eliminated:\n\nChoice (A) suggests that people will try to increase their pretax incomes to make up for increased tax rates. That way, their post-tax incomes will be about the same, despite the increase in tax rates. This is one way for people to deal with increased taxes aside from evading their taxes!\n\nBut if (A) were not true, it would support the idea that more people will evade taxes as tax rates are increased. Instead of trying to raise their pre-tax incomes, most people will be faced with lower post-tax incomes. That would give more people incentive to evade taxes, thus feeding into the cycle described above.\n\nSo we don't NEED choice (A) to be true in order to have a vicious cycle. In fact, if (A) were true, it would work  the argument by describing something that could help break the vicious cycle. Eliminate (A).\n\nThis would actually work against the argument by suggesting that the government might be able to recover some tax revenue without raising taxes. If (B) were true, then it might be possible to slow or even break the vicious cycle.\n\nWe don't need choice (B) to be true in order to have a vicious cycle, so eliminate (B).\n\nLet's think about what would happen if lawmakers DID allow adequately for revenue that will be lost through evasion.\n\nIn other words, the lawmakers decide that they need some amount of tax revenue, and they set the tax rates accordingly. In doing so, they ASSUME that some people are going to evade income taxes. But that's okay because the lawmakers accounted for this in their calculations. So even though some people will evade taxes, the government is still getting all of the tax revenue that it expected to get.\n\nIn that case, there is no need for additional tax revenue and, thus, no need to increase tax rates! That means that the vicious cycle would be avoided. The vicious cycle described above could not happen unless choice (C) were true, so (C) looks good.\n\nMaybe some people WOULD stop evading taxes if tax rates were lowered, regardless of whether fines are raised. But if the government needs more tax revenue, tax rates will go UP, and the cycle will continue.\n\nChoice (D) suggests that lawmakers might be able to  the cycle by raising fines and lowering tax rates, but the vicious cycle could occur even if (D) were not true. Thus, (D) should be eliminated.\n\nAccording to the passage, whenever taxes are increased, some amount of people (not everyone) will say, \"Enough is enough! I'm going to hide some of my income to evade taxes!\" When taxes are raised again, another group will say the same thing... and so on and so on.\n\nThe argument implies that the amount of people who evade taxes will increase  as taxes are increased. Choice (E) suggests that, once a certain tax level is surpassed, almost everyone will evade taxes! If this were true, there would be no \"cycle\". Instead, for any given tax rate, either 1) most taxpayers WILL evade taxes or 2) most taxpayers will NOT evade taxes.\n\nChoice (E) would have to be  in order to have a vicious cycle, so eliminate (E).\n\n(C) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "­Oriole Airlines plans to offer a $25 discount to anyone who books a flight directly through the airline's Web site. The executives reason that this strategy will increase net profits by encouraging consumers to visit the Oriole Airlines website directly rather than shop for less expensive flights through independent Websites that list fares from different airlines.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, would present the most serious potential weakness of the plan?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Here is what we know: People visit independent websites (such as Makemytrip) to get the cheapest flights. They are able to see fares of many airlines on those sites.\nOriole plans to lure customers to their own website by offering a $25 discount (which independent sites do not offer). It hopes that to get that discount, people will come directly to Oriole and book from there (and will not see cheaper flights of other airlines). \nThis is how Oriole plans to increase its profits.\nFor all purposes, we assume that Oriole's fares are the same everywhere since we are not given that this is not the case. \n\nAim of the plan: Increase net profits\n\nWhat will weaken the plan?\n\n\n\nThis is perhaps a reason to offer the discount too. If rivals are offering, Oriole may be losing business because of that. To get a level playing field, Oriole should offer too. The profits may increase if it is level playing field. \n\n\n\nThis is a problem. Oriole does well when people shop at independent websites. Their fares are the lowest so people likely book Oriole. Now, if Oriole attracts them to its own website by offering $25 discount, all that happens is that Oriole loses $25 on every transaction. Hence, cost increases for Oriole and it might end up seeing a decrease in net profit, forget about increasing it.\nHence, this certainly weakens our plan. \n\n\n\nIt is something already assumed by the plan. It changes nothing. \n\n\n\nThe opposite of this would have been troublesome for us. If consumers were \"window shopping\" at independent websites and then actually booking directly through airline websites, that would be bad for Orione's plan. People would still look at independent websites and find the cheapest flight and in case they chose Orione, they would come to Orione's website and get the discount and book here. That could lead to reduction in profit. \nBut as given, (D) has no impact on our plan. Our plan assumes that people shop at independent websites. \n\n\n\nThis is a bit confusing. I will re-write it by assuming a value for \"not more than $20\".\n\"Not more than $20 less expensive\" could be \"$10 less expensive\" or \"$0 less expensive\" or even \"$50 more expensive\" etc.\n\nIf Oriole's flights are generally cheaper than the cheapest, then as happened in option (B), it weakens our plan.\nBut if Oriole's flights are $50 more expensive than the cheapest, our plan could work. \n\nHence option (E) doesn't tell us how our plan will be impacted. \n\nAnswer (B)",

It hopes to do this by offering free tutoring to certain students whose scores are in the bottom 10 percent. \n\nThe school board’s report ultimately concludes that the tutoring will be ineffective at raising the school’s rankings because these bottom 10% students do not have time to take advantage of the free tutoring. In other words, because this 1 “path” to reaching a higher ranking is unavailable, the plan to offer tutoring services to these students will not get the school to its goal of higher state rankings \n\nHowever, what if there was another “path” via which offering the tutoring services would get the school to its ultimate goal of a higher state ranking?  \n\nAnswer choice D offers just such a path. If by offering the tutoring services the students not in the bottom 10% become motivated to study harder, this may lead to higher scores by these students, thereby helping the school reach its overall goal of a higher state ranking. This is a different “path” not considered by the school board’s report. \n\nIn this way, answer choice D effectively counters the school board’s report.\n\nAnswer Choice A is wrong because the q stem asks us to counter the school board’s conclusion. The school board’s conclusion is that “this” (the free tutoring plan to certain bottom 10% students) is unlikely to be effective at reaching the goal of a higher state ranking. Answer A, by saying that scores are only 1 aspect that goes into the state ranking, does not directly address this conclusion about whether the planned free tutoring will help the school reach its goal. \n\nB is wrong because evidence about what other schools are doing does nothing to counter the conclusion that this tutoring plan will not work. \n\nC is wrong because even if these certain students believe the tutoring WOULD help them, the fact still remains that they will not have the time to take advantage. \n\nE is wrong because this is not a discussion about money.

To do this, the Department of Energy Spokesman says: \"In order to reduce our nation's energy consumption, we should require that tenants be responsible for paying their utility bills in residential rental properties\". Now we need a statement that gives reason to believe that the plan outlined above will not reach its goal.\n\n2. Even if the tenants are more conscious about energy consumption, it doesn't necessarily mean that if they pay then the plan won't work. Here, if the tenants pay their bills, then the owners could be using appliances and furnaces that aren't the most energy-efficient. Then, energy consumption possibly won't decrease. The goal is to reduce energy consumption. Even if residential real estate contributes little, a decrease there would still mean an overall reduction in the country's energy consumption. This is irrelevant since it isn't known how this information would provide a reason. Just because other nations offered rental subsidies, doesn't mean that not doing that will not help successfully reduce energy consumption. </span>",

They are found mainly in or near the Arctic and Antarctic. In attempts to explain how they were formed, two hypotheses are currently most commonly debated: one proposes frost, the other heat. But frost cannot be the complete explanation for the uniformity in size of the circles on Marion Island, located in the maritime Subantarctic. Therefore, heat, either in water or in saturated soil, was likely involved in the formation of the circles.\n\nWhich of the following would, if true, most weaken the geographer's argument?\n",

        "explanation": "The author concludes the following:\n\n\n\nThat conclusion is based on these premises:\n\n\n\nOne aspect of the argument  that we may notice is that it says basically the following. Since one thing, \"frost,\" cannot explain the uniformity in size of the circles, another thing, \"heat,\" was likely involved.\n\nSo, the conclusion that heat was likely involved is based only the fact that frost alone could not have produced the circles. The argument does not include any direct evidence that heat was involved.\n\nThe correct answer will weaken the support for the conclusion or cast doubt on the conclusion.\n\n\n\nThis choice may seem to weaken the argument, but it actually makes no difference. The support for the conclusion, \"frost cannot be the complete explanation for the uniformity,\" acknowledges that frost may exist where the circles are but still cannot explain how they were formed.\n\nSo, what this choice says is in line with the argument.\n\n\n\nAs discussed above, the conclusion that heat was likely involved in the formation of the circles is not directly supported. Rather, it's only indirectly supported by the fact that frost cannot completely explain the uniformity in size of the circles.\n\nSo, the author is basing the conclusion that heat was likely involved on the fact that SOMETHING other than frost must have been involved.\n\nThus, if what this choice says is true, then we have less reason to believe that heat was likely involved because there are possibilities other than heat and frost.\n\nWhat if there are three other possibilities? Then, maybe there's only a 25 percent chance that heat was involved. In that case, the conclusion that heat was \"likely\" involved no longer makes sense.\n\nSo, this choice weakens the support the premises provide for the conclusion.\n\n\n\nThis choice has no effect on the argument. It basically tells us that there are things other than sorted circles that may be formed by heat or frost. That information tells us nothing about whether heat was involved in the formation of sorted circles.\n\n\n\nWe have no reason to believe that  the circles were formed is related to  they were formed. So, this choice has no effect on the argument.\n\n\n\nThe argument is not about how the material came to be on Marion Island. It's about how the circles were formed.

        "explanation": "Hey,\n\nThere seems to be enough confusion surrounding this to merit the full  treatment. So let's do it!\n\nWhenever a major airplane accident occurs, there is a dramatic increase in the number of airplane mishaps reported in the media, a phenomenon that may last for as long as a few months after the accident. Airline officials assert that the publicity given the gruesomeness of major airplane accidents focuses media attention on the airline industry, and the increase in the number of reported accidents is caused by an increase in the number of news sources covering airline accidents, not by an increase in the number of accidents.\n\nConclusion: Increase in reported accidents caused by increased media attention, not increased accidents\nPremises: After major accident, dramatic increase in reported accidents\nAssumption: There's not some other reason accidents may increase\n\nThis question fits nicely into a category we call \"Eliminate alternate causes\", in which case the assumption is always that there isn't some other cause. All we need to do is weaken that assumption, and we're good to go.\n\nA. The publicity surrounding airline accidents is largely limited to the country in which the crash occurred.\nPROBLEM: This doesn't change any of the facts as we know them. All we care about is the inarguable fact that reporting goes up after a major accident. It doesn't matter where.\n\nB. Airline accidents tend to occur far more often during certain peak travel months.\nANSWER: This explains why there might be lots of accidents that arrive in groups: because of peak travel times. This means it actually is more accidents causing the increased coverage.\n\nC. News organizations do not have any guidelines to help them decide how severe an accident must be for it to receive coverage.\nPROBLEM: This means that reportage might be a bit arbitrary, but like answer choice A, it doesn't change the facts. We want to know WHY reporting of accidents goes up. To say that there is no guideline to connect severity to newsworthiness does NOTHING to address the issue of why reportage goes up after a major accident.\n\nD. Airplane accidents receive coverage by news sources only when the news sources find it advantageous to do so.\nPROBLEM: Still, we don't know WHY they would find it advantageous to report more airplane accidents at some time than at others, so this doesn't help us.\n\nE. Studies by government regulations show that the number of airplane flight miles remains relatively constant from month to month.\nPROBLEM: This actually strengthens the argument. If flight miles are constant, it wouldn't make sense for there to be more accidents at one time than another, so it must just be a question of reportage.\n\nHope that helps!\n\n-t",

The reason, recently discovered, is the presence of nerve-growth inhibitors in the spinal cord. Antibodies that deactivate those inhibitors have now been developed. Clearly, then, nerve repair will be a standard medical procedure in the foreseeable future.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, casts the most serious doubt on the accuracy of the prediction above?\n",

        "explanation": "Dear \n\nHere's (A), the OA: \n(A) .\nThat's a very complicated sentence.  If you don't understand the term \",\" you need to look that up and understand it thoroughly.  \n\nFirst, there are \"\" in the human body.  Call these SING for short--an acronym.  \n\nThe argument proposes using \"\" to \"\" the SING, to render them completely ineffective and non-functioning.     \n\nWe may wonder whether \"\" is all the SING do or whether they have any other jobs.  \n\nWell, (A) tells us quite definitively that \"\" SING.  In other words, the SING have other jobs in the human body, their \"main jobs,\" and \"\" is simply some that happens in addition to everything else they do.  Each SING has a \"main job\" first, and \"\" is an extra that also happens--a by-product.  \n\nThis piece of information presents a HUGE problem for the argument.  We want to encourage nerve regrowth, but if we us antibodies to render the SING ineffective, then that will stop  the SING do--it will stop all their \"main jobs,\" as well as removing the blog to nerve regrowth.  \n\nNow, we don't know what those main jobs are, but the human body is truly miraculously designed.  Three billion years of evolution have come together in producing a complex system so brilliantly interconnect and interrelated that it truly boggles our mind.  Each body is a miracle packed full of a million miracles.  Human beings walk around every day with no idea that their bodies are astonishing miracles beyond all reckoning.   \n\nIf a substance in the body has a \"main job,\" chances are very good that this \"main job\" is absolutely essential for the life and health of the body.  Stopping this \"main job\" would have lead to dysfunction, illness, and perhaps even instant death! \n\nThus, shutting off the SING and their \"main job\" would produce devastating effects.  Those side-effects are far too severe and dangerous, so this kind of treatment does not look promising after all.  \n\nDoes all this make sense?\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)",

The eldest son of the village's blacksmith will take up his father’s business and become the next blacksmith.

In order to question the credibility of the argument, the correct option must point out that the times are different and that there need not be a parallel between career systems today and in medieval times.\n\n gives one more example of dynastic systems today. If anything, (A) lending further credibility to the argument and is not refuting it. For the same reason,  can also be eliminated.\n\n implies that having a father in the same profession increases the possibility of the son following the father’s footsteps. The reasoning and implication in (C) is probably not as evident as in (A) and (D) but ultimately, (C) lends credibility to the argument, if anything.\n\n is possibly a very attractive option. However, the argument does not state that genetic makeup was the reason that people chose a profession; rather it was the accepted practice of the day. Therefore, stating that genetic makeup does not influence the success of a career is irrelevant to the argument. Also, the argument does not discuss “success” in a career at all but just the choice of a career.\n\n</span> works because it implies that there was no choice given to those who lived in mediaeval times. The argument, when discussing the “likelihood” of someone becoming a baseball player implies that anyone today has the choice to become one, if they wanted to.

So, the information about non-criminal cases provided by this choice is irrelevant.\n\nIf you weren’t sure whether public prosecutors are involved in non-criminal cases, you could notice that the passage says that “public prosecutors often go a year or more without having to fight a single case in court.” So, we can tell that, regardless of what this choice says, about non-criminal cases being fought in the courts, it remains the case that prosecutors are not fighting cases in court in Farland.\n\n\n\nThis choice helps to confirm that Farland’s spending on the salaries of public prosecutors is unwarranted.

After all, it could be the case that the criminal defendants don’t wage costly court battles because they are convinced they will lose because they will be dealing with “ highly skilled attorneys” serving as public prosecutors.\n\nSo, Farland’s spending on the salaries of those attorneys could be doing just what it’s meant to do, save money by causing criminal defendants to accept plea bargains rather than wage costly court battles.\n\n\n\nThis choice has no effect on the argument.

Clearly, music has an inherently greater emotional effect on teenagers than on people of other ages.\n\nEach of the following, if true, weakens the argument presented above EXCEPT\n",
        "answer": "Added OA",
        "explanation": "HERE IS OE\n\n(1) Identify the Question Type\n\nThe language \"weakens\" and \"if true\" indicates that this is a Weaken the Conclusion question. The \"EXCEPT\" variation indicates that we need to find and eliminate 4 \"weaken\" answers. The \"odd one out\" answer, an answer that does not weaken, will be the correct answer.\n\n(2) Deconstruct the Argument\n\nGiven the opportunity to mention one song from any period of their lives, the survey respondents, who were between 40 and 60 years old, overwhelmingly named songs that were popular when they were aged between 13 and 17. The author claims that this data indicates that music has more emotional power over teenagers than over other age groups.\n\n(3) State the Goal\n\nWe're asked to find something that does not weaken the argument. The four (incorrect) answers, which will weaken the argument, must each make the conclusion at least somewhat less likely to be true or valid. The correct answer will either strengthen the conclusion or be irrelevant to the conclusion.\n\nThe passage leaves no doubt that the participants disproportionately named songs that were popular when they were teenagers. So, to weaken the argument, we must introduce possible alternative explanations for this finding. In other words, we need to identify another possible reason – apart from the greater inherent emotional impact of music – why so many of the survey participants would name songs from that particular period of their lives.\n\n(4) Work From Wrong To Right\n\n(A) If the survey asked participants to focus on their teenage years, then the participants may have been biased. The preponderance of songs from their teenage years may simply reflect that bias, rather than signifying anything important about the music itself.\n\n(B) The argument concluded that the music itself inherently causes an emotional impact. This statement, by contrast, indicates the opposite: an emotional event causes someone to remember a particular song. If teenagers are more likely to experience emotional events, then they're also more likely to remember a particular song associated with the event, but not because the music itself caused the emotional impact; rather, the music gains emotional power simply by association with those separate events.\n\n(C) CORRECT. Reasonable people might disagree as to whether this choice is irrelevant or whether it strengthens the conclusion; either way, it does not weaken the conclusion. If people have better recollection of memories that are more emotionally intense, then the conclusion in the passage -- that music is remembered best when it was most emotionally potent -- is supported by this choice.\n\n(D) If the participants listened to a greater number of songs as teenagers than at other periods in their lives, then they would reasonably be expected to remember more songs from their teenage years than from other periods, and there would be a greater probability that any song selected would be from this period. In this case, the survey result simply reflects the greater quantity of music to which the participants were exposed as teenagers, rather than any inherent quality of the music itself.\n\n(E) If this statement is true, then most of these songs would have been popular for a substantial time before and/or after the participant's teenage years, too. In that case, even though those songs were popular when the participants were teenagers, they were also popular during other periods of the participants' lives; we don't know at what age the cited song impacted that participant specifically.",

So if the hunting season is from Jan to June, it has been closing in June only. This means that even if hunters hunt for the entire hunting season, they still do not reach the 5% limit. So removing the restriction will have no effect.\n\nD only tells you that the increasing population has led to colonizing other grounds too. It just tells you that the population has increased a lot and the geese are spreading. It doesn't say that removing the restrictions will not help.\nUnderstand the argument: Snow geese populate the Arctic (i.e. the north pole region) and are displacing other species there. They move south in winters where there numbers are reduced due to hunting. There are restrictions on hunting. The argument says 'remove these restrictions so that the number of geese reduces more so that other species can survive.\n\nNow your option B tells you that the restrictions are ancient and are meaningful today. They haven't come into effect for many years. Then removing the restrictions won't help, isn't it?\nOn the other hand, option D says that the geese population has increased and now they are also using those grounds in the southern regions that they had not used for many years.

All of these are accidental beings.  \n\nWe could easy imagine a world with, say, an ocean of water or an atmosphere of air.  We don't even have to imagine it, because the planet Mars provides a perfect example.  These two are accidental beings.

What is an example of something that has a guaranteed existence, such that we couldn't even imagine a world without it?  Hmm.  It's not immediate obvious than anything falls in this category.  \n\nSome might argue that mathematical ideas, the ideas of pure mathematics, would be in this category.  In other words, there would be fundamental mathematical statements that would be true of any imaginable world, even if the folks in that world never figured out anything about mathematics.  This is conceivable, but debatable.  \n\nWhat it comes down to is that we cannot be sure whether there actually is anything that would qualify as a \".\"  Hmm.  That is awfully problematic for the argument as a whole, because if we are not sure whether there is any \"necessary being\" in the first place, then we can't use this supposition to prove anything else.    \n\nOK, now we are ready to look at the answers: \n\nThis argument is not really about cause and effect.  This is not correct.  \n\n\nHmm.  The actual words are used in more or less their ordinary senses.  It's just that the ideas are questionable, not the words themselves.  This is not correct.   \n\n\nThere's no logical contradiction without the argument presented.  It has holes, but it doesn't contradict itself.  This is incorrect.   \n\n\nThe argument does make the distinction of \"accidental being\" vs. \"necessary being,\" and we are not sure that anything would actually qualify as the latter.  In a way, the assumption that there is a unique \"necessary\" being is tantamount to the assumption of the existence of God, which the argument is trying to prove.  This is a promising answer.   \n\n\nThe argument doesn't really present evidence .  It presents ideas and definitions.  Again, everything here is self-consistent, just not consistent with our more modern way of thinking.  \n\nThe best answer here is the OA, .  \n\nDoes this make sense?\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)",

During the year following the inception of the publicity campaign, the frequency of harassment reports filed with the city attorney’s office tripled. The publicity campaign has therefore been successful, in that it has inspired more victims of workplace harassment to pursue their complaints.\n\nWhich of the following most seriously weakens the conclusion of the passage above?\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "Just because nothing bad will happen for doing something is no reason to think people will do it. Something good needs to happen. To give an absurd example, if I tell you 'eat this piece of scrap metal, nothing bad will happen', knowing that nothing bad will happen is not going to make you any more likely to eat the metal. The same is true in this question. That there are no negative consequences for filing a false harassment claim is no reason to think false claims will be filed. There would need to be some benefit to the person filing the false claim, and I can't see what that benefit could possibly be. If the claim is false, the person filing the claim is not going to receive any kind of compensation or other benefit. There's sure to be paperwork and tribunal appearances that would consume the complainant's time. Most importantly, accusing someone of racial or sexual harassment is an extremely serious thing to do; it can very easily ruin that person's career. It's not the type of thing people do frivolously, though you'd need to assume that people would for D to be the answer here. That's why I said above that D requires one to make some absurdly cynical assumptions about human behaviour. \n\nFurther, one could easily contend that D actually strengthens the argument. Some people who are  victims of harassment might, in the past, have been reluctant to pursue a claim because they were concerned they lacked the evidence to prove their case. That is, they might have been concerned that their claim woud be deemed 'invalid'. Knowing that there will be no negative consequences if they are unable to prove their case might make it  likely that these  victims of harassment will file a claim. The conclusion of the passage has nothing to do with the number of claims which are actually  or found to be valid - the conclusion is simply that more legitimate victims have come forward with their complaints. If answer D is true, it may in fact be the  that so many new legitimate victims came forward, and rather than weaken the argument, it may actually explain why the facts presented in the argument are true.\n\nOne final point: we aren't concerned here with whether the number of legitimate complaints actually . The argument is true as long as the number of legitimate complaints . So to weaken the argument, it is not enough only to establish that there were false claims; you'd need to establish that a full  of complaints were illegitimate. That is, for D to be the answer here, the campaign publicity would need to have inspired so many false complaints as to cause the total number of complaints to triple. As I discussed above, I can't see how one could reasonably think that could be the case.\n\nSo I stand by what I said above. I think it's a very poorly contrived question; it's illogical, and requires one to introduce assumptions which I find completely unreasonable.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

In some questions, pre-thinking can help me get the answer spot-on, before I even encounter the answer choices; in others, I can pre-think up a storm and find no corresponding answers. Because it is difficult to predict whether any given question will fall into Camp A or Camp B, I typically bypass pre-thinking and engage directly with the question, then the passage, then each answer choice, making sure the option I choose has firm grounding in the text and answers the question being asked.\n\nAbout your second scenario above, I will say that I used to think along similar lines, but after working through plenty of questions on my own and helping students with others, I have come to appreciate that the only information you can take as gospel is that which is presented in the passage. Even if the argument or conclusion is wayward, the information on which that argument may be based should  be taken as untruthful or doubtful. In fact, GMAC™ even speaks to this point in the  in the  chapter:\n\n\n\nMany critical reasoning questions will require you to evaluate the soundness of the reasoning presented in a passage. To evaluate reasoning, you do not need to decide whether premises or conclusions are actually true. Determining actual truth is beyond the scope of the test: no test-taker could determine the truth or falsity of every assertion present in critical reasoning passages. Moreover, many critical reasoning passages refer to fictional scenarios. Normally, in evaluating a piece of reasoning, you should try to\n\nIn the question at hand, the passage tells us that --a premise.

Now, if Oriole attracts them to its own website by offering $25 discount, all that happens is that Oriole loses $25 on every transaction. Hence, cost increases for Oriole and it might end up seeing a decrease in net profit, forget about increasing it.\nHence, this certainly weakens our plan. \n\n\n\nIt is something already assumed by the plan. It changes nothing. \n\n\n\nThe opposite of this would have been troublesome for us. If consumers were \"window shopping\" at independent websites and then actually booking directly through airline websites, that would be bad for Orione's plan. People would still look at independent websites and find the cheapest flight and in case they chose Orione, they would come to Orione's website and get the discount and book here. That could lead to reduction in profit. \nBut as given, (D) has no impact on our plan. Our plan assumes that people shop at independent websites. \n\n\n\nThis is a bit confusing. I will re-write it by assuming a value for \"not more than $20\".\n\"Not more than $20 less expensive\" could be \"$10 less expensive\" or \"$0 less expensive\" or even \"$50 more expensive\" etc.\n\nIf Oriole's flights are generally cheaper than the cheapest, then as happened in option (B), it weakens our plan.\nBut if Oriole's flights are $50 more expensive than the cheapest, our plan could work. \n\nHence option (E) doesn't tell us how our plan will be impacted. \n\nAnswer (B)",

        "question": "Guillemots are birds of Arctic regions. They feed on fish that gather beneath thin sheets of floating ice, and they nest on nearby land. Guillemots need 80 consecutive snow-free days in a year to raise their chicks, so until average temperatures in the Arctic began to rise recently, the guillemots’ range was limited to the southernmost Arctic coast. Therefore, if the warming continues, the guillemots’ range will probably be enlarged by being extended northward along the coast.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?\n",

        "explanation": "Hey All,\n\nEnough questions enough that I figured it might be worth my weighing in. As any good instructor would, I'm going to focus on the passage first.\n\nConclusion: Warming will extend Guillemots range north\n\nPremises: Guillemots feed on fish beneath ice, nesting nearby. Need snow-free area to raise chicks. Area is warming, particularly north.\n\nAssumption: Something other than the warming will keep them from extending range.\n\nWe know the assumption will be this limited, because otherwise the argument is solid (i.e. if the warm area is expanding, and they can live in warm weather, then obviously their range will expand).\n\n(A) Even if the warming trend continues, there will still be years in which guillemot chicks are killed by an unusually early snow.\nProblem: This has no connection to the issue of range, because this would happen anywhere.\n\n(B) If the Arctic warming continues, guillemots’ current predators are likely to succeed in extending their own range farther north.\nProblem: In a number of answer choices here, the question is trying to trick you into thinking that the conclusion is that the guillemots will THRIVE in the new areas. But that's not the conclusion. The conclusion is merely that the range of areas in which they can survive will expand. This has no effect on that. The same predators joining them in the new area will result in much the same lifestyle the guillemots already have (same predators).\n\n(C) Guillemots nest in coastal areas, where temperatures are generally higher than in inland areas.\nProblem: This doesn't affect the conclusion, which is that the increasing temperatures ELSEWHERE will expand the range of the guillemots.\n\n(D) If the Arctic warming continues, much of the thin ice in the southern Arctic will disappear.\nAnswer: This one may look out of scope, but remember that scope isn't really an issue on strengthen/weaken questions; you're allowed to bring in other information. If the thin ice disappears, then the guillemots will not be able to expand their habitat, because they survive on the fish that live under the ice. This relates to their ability to expand. To contrast with B, the predators are THE SAME in the new area or the old. In D, the food source is DIFFERENT (worse) in the new area, which weakens the conclusion.\n\n\n(E) The fish that guillemots eat are currently preyed on by a wider variety of predators in the southernmost Arctic regions than they are farther north.\nProblem: This actually strengthens the argument, because the guillemots are planning to move north. fewer predators means a better chance of succeeding.\n\nHope that helps!",

Generally deer ticks pick up the bacterium while in the larval stage from feeding on infected white footed mice. However, certain other species on which the larvae feed do not harbor the bacterium. Therefore, if the population of these other species were increased, the number of ticks acquiring the bacterium and hence the number of people contracting Lyme disease would likely decline.

A single host animal can be the source of bacteria for many tick larvae.\nE. None of the other species on which deer tick larvae feed harbor other bacteria that ticks transmit to humans\n\nI think, given the terminology and sentence structures used, this passage is not very easy to understand. Let's first understand the passage:\n\n\n\n1. Disease: Lyme\n    Caused by: bacteria\n    Source of bacteria: Deer ticks\n2. Deer ticks pick the bacterium in their larva stage, from infected white footed mice\n3. White footed mice is not the only food of Deer ticks - there is some food which does not contain this bacteria\n4. \n\nIf we read 3 &amp; 4 together, we can see that the link between the premise and the conclusion is that once these deer ticks will have 'other' food to feed on, they'll stop or reduce eating white footed mice.\n\nOne more thing to observe, before we move on to the option analysis, is that there are two parts of the conclusion; therefore, a strengthener can strengthen either of these two parts.\n\n\n\nA. Ticks do not suffer any adverse consequences from carrying the bacterium that causes Lyme disease in humans - Whether Ticks suffer or not is not our concern here. This is .\n\nB. There are no known cases of a human’s contracting Lyme disease through contact with white-footed mice - This means that humans acquire this from Deer Ticks only - same as first statement of the passage. No new information provided. Thus, this cannot be the correct choice. .\n\nC. A deer tick feeds only once while in the larval stage. - If a deer tick feeds only once in the larval stage, then once it has eaten something which is not infected, it'll not acquire the bacterium through this way. Therefore, if we increase the amount of uninfected feed, the probability that a larvae will eat uninfected feed will increase and therefore, its probablity of acquiring the bacterium will decrease. This, therefore, seems to strengthen the argument. For surity, let's also look at the remaining two choices.\n\nD. A single host animal can be the source of bacteria for many tick larvae. - Whether a single host affects only one tick larvae or multiple larvae, it  at hand. Increasing the amount of uninfected feed should still decrease the probability of deer tick feeding on these infected mice.\n\nE. None of the other species on which deer tick larvae feed harbor other bacteria that ticks transmit to humans - The issue is about Lyme disease only.

This problem is answered correctly by about 45% of test takers and is classified as difficult (the hardest GMAT questions have success rates under 20%. Fortunately, questions this difficult appear infrequently). Students can miss questions for a variety of reasons: \n\n \n\nGiven that the stimulus is a simple fact set and that none of the incorrect answers attracted more than 15% of test takers, the difficulty in this problem apparently lies in the correct answer. \n\nAnswer choice (A): The controversy in the stimulus is about the categorization of Cézanne as an artist, not about Cézanne’s work. Further, even if the answer did correctly reference the categorization controversy, the answer would still be suspect because of the word “highly.” The stimulus indicates that only a small few reject the categorization of Cézanne as an early modernist and most experts accept it. \n\nAnswer choice (B): The stimulus asserts that Cézanne inspired the creators of abstract art, not that Cézanne himself created abstract art. \n\nAnswer choice (C): This correct answer is a paraphrase of the first sentence. The deceptiveness of this answer lies in two areas: 1. The substitution of “develop” for “inspire.” Some students feel the word “develop” is too strong, but if Cézanne inspired the creators of the next generation of art then he helped develop it. 2. The use of the word “modernism.” Some students are thrown off by “modernism” because they expect to see “abstract” instead. The stimulus is careful about saying “twentieth-century modernist creators of abstract art.” Notice how the test makers use answer choice (B)—which mentions “abstract”—to subtly prepare you to make this error. \n\nAnswer choice (D): The first sentence indicates that Cézanne inspired the modernist creators. The rest of the stimulus discusses a disagreement about the categorization of Cézanne that is not resolved in favor of either group. Hence, there is no way for us to determine if modern art owes less to Cézanne than many experts believe. \n\nAnswer choice (E): The word “tends” is the problem in this answer choice. Logically, “tends” means “most.” So, according to answer choice (E), Cézanne’s work is usually misinterpreted as modernist. The stimulus disagrees with this view: only a “small few” reject the categorization of Cézanne as a modernist whereas the majority accepts it. Further, the disagreement in the stimulus involves art experts, and from their view we would dispute answer choice (E). Answer choice (E) can also be understood as involving all interpretation of Cézanne’s work—whether by art expert or not—and from this perspective the answer is still unsupported since the views of others are not discussed in the stimulus.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "­Here's a brief explanation addressing popular options A, B, and C.\n\n Only A is an assumption since its negation breaks down the argument. Neither negation of B nor negation of C breaks down the argument.\n\n: The price of rayon will soon exceed the price of cotton. - If the price of rayon becomes higher than the price of cotton, how will it make sense for clothing manufacturers to blend more rayon?! In such a case, they will rather use more of cotton. So, the negation of A breaks down the argument.\n\n: (This is tricky) The price of rayon  to changes due to  of the agricultural difficulties that cotton is subject to.\n\nWe get to know that SOME of the agricultural difficulties will also apply to rayon. So, we can expect SOME increase in the price of rayon. However, SOME increase does not break down the argument based on skyrocketing prices of cotton. \n\n \"The price of rayon is not subject to changes due to some of the agricultural difficulties that cotton is subject to.\"\n\nThen its negation would be \"The price of rayon  to changes due to ALL of the agricultural difficulties that cotton is subject to.\"\n\nSo, all the agricultural difficulties that apply to cotton also apply to rayon. In this case, the argument breaks down.\n\nHowever, the negation of original option B DOES NOT break down the argument.\n\n: Increasing demand for rayon is likely to cause its price to rise.\n\nJust as in the case of B, some price rise WILL NOT break down the argument.\n\n \"Increasing demand for rayon is unlikely to cause its price to rise to the same extent as the price of cotton.\"\n\nThen its negation would be \"Increasing demand for rayon is likely to cause its price to rise to the same extent as the price of cotton.\"\n\nIf both prices are rising to the same extent, we don't have a reason to expect clothing manufacturers to switch from cotton to rayon. Thus, the argument breaks down in this modified version of option C.\n\nHowever, the argument doesn't break down in the case of negation of the original option C.

        "explanation": "The number of off-road vehicles has been increasing steadily. \n\nIn Vicente's argument, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?\n\nThe first part of this choice is correct since the first boldfaced portion is a conclusion for which support is offered. After all, \"This decline is probably attributable, at least in part, to off-road vehicle use,\" is supported by the statements that follow it, \"The number of off-road vehicles has been increasing steadily,\" and \"Their use disrupts sensitive bird habitats.\"\n\nHowever, the second and third parts of this choice are incorrect since since, as we just saw, the second boldfaced portion supports the first and thus is a premise rather than the main conclusion of the argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is completely incorrect.\n\nFor one thing, it's not the case that the first boldface supports the second. Rather, \"This decline is probably attributable, at least in part, to off-road vehicle use,\" is supported by the facts \"The number of off-road vehicles has been increasing steadily,\" and \"Their use disrupts sensitive bird habitats.\"\n\nAccordingly, we can see also that the second boldface supports the first and is not supported by any other statement in the argument. Thus, the second is a premise rather than a conclusion of the argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe very beginning of this choice is correct since the first boldfaced portion does support the main conclusion of the argument.\n\nHowever, this choice quickly goes wrong because the main conclusion is not \"the only conclusion drawn in the argument\" Rather, the first boldfaced portion is also a conclusion, an intermediate conclusion that is supported by the two sentences that follow it.\n\nAlso, the second part of this choice is incorrect because, while the second boldfaced portion is a premise, it doesn't directly support the main conclusion of the argument. Rather, it supports the first boldfaced portion.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice may be the trickiest choice in this question. It's easy to get the impression that the first boldfaced portion is the main conclusion of the argument if you read the argument too fast and miss the fact that the first sentence states the main conclusion, and then the second boldfaced portion can seem to be supported by the sentence between the two boldfaced portions. Thus, if we're not careful, we can decide that this choice is correct.\n\nHowever, as we saw, the main conclusion of the argument is stated by the first sentence of the passage, which is supported by the first boldfaced portion.\n\nAlso, the second boldfaced portion is not a conclusion supported by anything else in the passage. Rather, it's simply a statement of fact about the use of off-road vehicles.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice matches exactly what we have seen through analysis of the argument and our review of the other choices.\n\nThe first boldfaced portion is a conclusion that is supported by the two statements that follow it, one of which is the second boldfaced portion.\n\nThen the first boldfaced portion supports the main conclusion of the argument, which is the first statement of the passage. So, it is the case that the first boldfaced portion is not the main conclusion.\n\nThus, this choice accurately describes the roles of the two boldfaced portions of the passage.\n\nThe correct answer is",

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "This is testing the converse and contrapositive, which is something tested far more often on the LSAT than on the GMAT. Here the argument says \"If a doctor does not answer questions, that doctor is not competent\". If we just negate both of those clauses, to get \"If a doctor does answer questions, that doctor is competent\", then we're taking the converse of the original sentence. The converse is not generally a correct logical deduction -- \"if x = 3, then x  0\" is clearly true, but the converse, \"if x is not equal to 3, x is negative\" clearly does not need to be true. What is always true is the \"contrapositive\" -- we must negate both clauses, but also reverse their order: \"If a doctor is competent, that doctor answers questions\" is a logically correct inference from the statements in this question, and \"If x &lt; 0, then x is not equal to 3\" is a logically correct inference from the mathematical example I give above.\n\nSo here, we want an answer choice that is in the same form as the original argument: the premise must read \"If X is true, then Y is true\", and the conclusion must falsely read \"X is not true, so Y is not true\". Most answer choices here start \"If X is true then Y is true\" and conclude with \"X is true, therefore...\" so most are wrong for that reason alone. But D is a match: \"If someone has two jobs, they cannot find balance\" becomes, if we take the (logically invalid) converse \"If someone does not have two jobs, they can find balance\".\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "When people show signs of having a heart attack an electrocardiograph (EKG) is often used to diagnose their condition. In a study, a computer program for EKG diagnosis of heart attacks was pitted against a very experienced, highly skilled cardiologist. The program correctly diagnosed a significantly higher proportion of the cases that were later confirmed to be heart attacks than did the cardiologist. Interpreting EKG data, therefore, should be left to computer programs.\n\nWhich one of the following, if true, most weakens the argument?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Computer program vs Cardiologist - EKG diagnosis\nThe program correctly diagnosed a significantly higher proportion of the cases that were later confirmed to be heart attacks than did the cardiologist. \n\nConclusion: Interpreting EKG data, therefore, should be left to computer programs.\n\nThe argument tells us that the program performed better in cases which resulted in heart attacks. IT is then concluding that computers are better at interpreting data.\n\nWhat can weaken this? What is the cardiologist performed better in cases which resulted in no heart attacks? What if she was able to better interpret the data in those situations? Then can we say that computers are better at interpreting data? No. We need to see overall results to find out who/what did a better job.\n\n(A) Experts agreed that the cardiologist made few obvious mistakes in reading and interpreting the EKG data.\n\nWell, if even a highly skilled cardiologist made mistakes, computer might be better at it. Does not weaken our conclusion.\n\n(B) The practice of medicine is as much an art as a science, and computer programs are not easily adapted to making subjective judgments.\n\nIrrelevant. We are talking about our conclusion based on our study.\n\n(C) The cardiologist correctly diagnosed a significantly higher proportion of the cases in which no heart attack occurred than did the computer program.\n\nCorrect. As discussed above. \n\n(D) In a considerable percentage of cases, EKG data alone are insufficient to enable either computer programs or cardiologists to make accurate diagnoses.\n\nIrrelevant. We are talking about who can make a better call based on EKG data alone.\n\n(E) The cardiologist in the study was unrepresentative of cardiologists in general with respect to skill and experience.\n\nWe know that the cardiologist in the study was highly skilled. If he was unrepresentative of cardiologists in general, it means general cardiologists are not this skilled. If even he could not do a better job than the computer, then it does seem that the job should be left to the computer. \n\nAnswer (C)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "Airline Representative: The percentage of flight delays caused by airline error decreased significantly this year. This indicates that airlines listened to complaints about preventable errors and addressed the problems. Although delays caused by weather and other uncontrollable factors will always be part of travel, preventable delays are clearly decreasing.\n\nWhich of the following most clearly points to a logical flaw in the representative's reasoning?\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "First, let's break down the airline representative's argument: \n\n of delays caused by airline error has reduced significantly this year reduction in delays caused by airline error  to a reducing  of preventable errors.\n\nWe're asked to find the answer choice that points out a logical flaw in this reasoning. Let's take a look at each answer choice:\nThe only piece of data we're given in the passage is that the percentage of delays caused by airline error has decreased significantly . There is no indication that the financial concerns mentioned in (A) are a new factor. The airline may have been underreporting the percentage of flight delays caused by airline error for several years. \n\nThere is nothing in (A) that points out the logical flaw in linking the significant reduction in the percentage of delays caused by airline error  to the airline saying that preventable delays are clearly decreasing. (A) is out.\n\nThe passage says the airline listened to complaints  and addressed the problem. There is no information about what the airline did with complaints caused by uncontrollable factors.\n\nAlso, there is no indication that the  of complaints was important. The passage simply says that complaints were listened to.\n\n(B) does not point out a logical flaw in the argument -- (B) cannot be our answer.\n\nThere is no suggestion in the passage that complaints are being used as the measure of the number of errors occurring in a year. We don't know how the errors are being measured so (C) does not show us a flaw in the reasoning -- (C) is out.\n\nIf delays caused by uncontrollable factors increased dramatically in the year we're interested in, then the  of delays caused by airline error could have decreased significantly.\n\nThis is true even if the number of delays caused by airline error remained the same, or even increased somewhat. Therefore, the  of delays caused by airline error could have decreased, while the  or delays caused by airline error could have increased.\n\nThis is a flaw in the argument's reasoning -- (D) looks good, but let's take a look at (E):\nWe're not worried about the customers' beliefs -- we're looking at the link between the percentage of delays caused by airline error and the actual number of delays caused by airline error.\n\n(E) does not help us examine this argument, so we can eliminate (E).\n\nThis means (D) is the only answer choice we have not eliminated. (D) is the answer to this question.\n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

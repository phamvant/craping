I’m growing tired, too. Do you have an estimated time of arrival so that I can inform the rest of the crew and create a plan for informing the passengers?\n\nCaptain: I know. This trip has been much more difficult than I had anticipated and I know we’re all in a hurry to get home. In order to conserve fuel so that we are guaranteed to make it today, I’ll slightly reduce our speed for the rest of the way. Please inform the passengers to be patient and the crew to help us manage this last leg of the journey.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, would constitute a reason to believe that the captain’s plan will not accomplish its goal?\n",

Irrelevant.\n\n B)The last leg of the journey is known to be the most treacherous leg of the trip.\nIrrelevant. If it is known, it must be included in the timeline.\n\n C)There are no fueling stations between the ship’s current location and its destination.\nIt doesn't matter whether fueling stations are there. The captain is trying to avoid the need to re-fuel.\n\n D)Rate of speed is not a substantial determinant of the amount of fuel a vessel uses.\nEven if speed is controlled, not much fuel will be saved. So then the plan may not succeed.\n\n E) Regardless of the rate at which the captain travels for the remainder of the trip, the ship will not come close to making its predicted arrival time.\nThe point is not to make the \"predicted arrival time\". The plan is to make it home today. Whatever delays have happened, have happened. Now the plan is to make it home today.\n\nAnswer (D)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "The consumption of ultra-processed foods has been linked to various diseases yet has steadily increased from 53 percent to 57 percent of the daily energy intake of US adults since 2001. Clearly, the US government should warn citizens about the harms of consuming such foods.\n\nWhich of the following would be most helpful in evaluating the above conclusion?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "for the  in \n    \n\n Official Explanation:\n\nThis choice is a trap. We might think that, if the percentage of the daily energy intake represented by ultra-processed foods is currently much lower for US adults than for adults in other countries, then the US government doesn’t have a good reason to warn citizens about the harms of consuming such foods.\n\nHowever, it remains the case that consumption of ultra-processed foods has been linked to various diseases yet has steadily increased from 53 percent to 57 percent of the daily energy intake of US adults since 2001. So, regardless of whether what this choice says is true, the US government still had good reason to warn the citizens about the harms of consuming such foods.\n\n\n\nThe answer to this question has no effect on the argument. After all, regardless of whether the main function of the government is to warn citizens about the harms of lifestyle choices, it could still make sense for the government to warn people about the harms of consuming ultra-processed foods.\n\n\n\nThe answer to this question makes a big difference. After all, the point of warning people about the harms of consuming ultra-processed foods is to make them aware of those adverse effects.\n\nSo, if the answer to this question is no, and consumption of ultra-processed food is NOT lower among those aware of its adverse effects, then maybe there’s no point to the government warning people about the harms of such foods, and the case for the conclusion is weakened.\n\nOn the other hand, if the answer to this question is yes, then we have more reason to believe that the government should warn people, since doing so could cause people to reduce their consumption of ultra-processed food.\n\n\n\nThis choice is a trap because we might get the sense that an increase in the total daily energy intake of an average US adult somehow makes a difference in the implications of the fact stated by the passage that the consumption of ultra-processed foods has steadily increased from 53 percent to 57 percent of the daily energy intake of US adults.\n\nHowever, the truth is that, regardless of whether the total daily energy intake of an average US adult has increased, it still remains the case that the proportion of food that US adults consume that’s represented by ultra-processed foods has increased. So, it would still make sense for the government to warn the citizens about the harms of consuming such food.\n\n\n\nRegardless of whether the cause  of the increase in consumption of ultra-processed foods is that they are designed to look and taste appealing, it could still help to warn people about the harms of consuming such foods. So, the answer to this question has no effect on the argument one  way or the other.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

Most young adults prefer a livelier writing style and, therefore, rarely read the Sentinel. Accordingly, we plan to adopt a livelier writing style in hopes of increasing our readership by attracting more young adult readers.\n\nThe publisher's plan assumes which of the following?\n",

In this case, the implied conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for the conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nThe correct answer will state an assumption that the plan assumes. In other words, it will state an assumption that's necessary for the conclusion to follow logically from the evidence.\n\n\n\nThis choice is a trap. It has the vibe of being correct in that we can get the impression that it's necessary for the plan to work. After all, we might reason that, if this choice isn't true, by implementing the plan, the sentinel may lose more readers than it gets.\n\nNotice, however, that the plan could work fine even if this choice is not true. After all, for the plan to work, it doesn't have to the case that the current readers  the new writing style. As long as they like the new writing style enough to keep reading the sentinel, the plan could work. For instance, if they like the new writing style only about as much as they like the traditional writing style, the plan will work.\n\nSo, the plan doesn't assume what this choice says.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice could explain why the Sentinel has used the traditional writing style: its writers prefer to write in that style.\n\nHowever, we don't need such an explanation. We need an assumption necessary for the plan to work, and it's not necessary for the plan of using a livelier style to work for the writers to prefer to write in a traditional style.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nIf we're not clear about the exact stated outcome of the plan, we can easily fall for this incorrect choice because, in the real world, if a newspaper did something to increase readership, the purpose of doing so would likely be to increase advertising revenues.\n\nSo, we need to notice that, in this case, what we know about the plan is that its purpose is \"increasing our readership by attracting more young adult readers.\" It doesn't have to be the case that advertising revenues will increase for the plan to lead to the outcome of increasing readership.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice provides additional support for the conclusion that the Sentinel will attract more young adult readers. However, we're not looking for support for that conclusion. We're looking for an assumption necessary for the plan of changing the writing style to work.\n\nFor that plan to work, it's not necessary for the Sentinel to also take other measures. In other words, it's not necessary for the Sentinel to have other plans.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis is the assumption that we need. For the plan to work, it must be the case that, by changing the writing style, the Sentinel will attract more readers than it will lose.\n\nAfter all, if this choice isn't true and the number of current readers who will object so strongly to the new writing style that they will stop reading the Sentinel will be GREATER than the number of new readers who will be attracted, then the Sentinel will experience a decrease, rather than an increase, in readership as a result of the plan.\n\nSo, for the plan to work, this choice must be true.\n\nThe correct answer is (E).",

        "question": "A comparison of the output of two spinning mills that produce woolen yarn—the Costello Mill and the Moorhead Mill—showed that the yarn from the Costello Mill had fewer flaws and greater strength. Since the Costello Mill's process differs from the Moorhead Mill's only in the way that the raw wool is treated before spinning, the treatment that the Costello Mill uses must be responsible for the superiority of its yarn.\n\nThe reasoning above assumes which of the following?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "We see that passage presents a scenario in which one spinning mill, Costello, produces yarn with fewer flaws and greater strength than are had by the yarn produced by another mill, Moorhead. Then, since the processes the two mills use to produce yarn differ in only one way, the way the raw wool is treated before spinning, the author concludes, \"the treatment that the Costello Mill uses must be responsible for the superiority of its yarn.\"\n\nThen, the question asks the following:\n\n\n\nSo, the correct answer will state an assumption upon which the argument depends.\n\nLet's go to the answer choices.\n\n\n\nThis choice is interesting. It brings up another possible reason for the for the difference in quality between the two mills' yarns, the quality of the raw wool.\n\nIf this choice is not true and the Moorhead Mill's raw wool is NOT at least as well suited as the Costello Mill's is for producing yarn of the quality that the Costello Mill produces, then the fact that the Costello Mill's process differs from the Moorhead Mill's only in the way the raw wool is treated no longer provides convincing support for the conclusion of the argument.\n\nAfter all, if the Moorhead Mill's raw wool is NOT at least as well suited as the Costello Mill's is for producing yarn of the quality that the Costello Mill produces, then it could be that the quality of the raw wool, rather than the difference between the ways wool is treated, is the cause of the difference in quality between the two mills' yarns.\n\nSo, for the argument to work, it must be the case that what this choice says IS true. In other words, the argument depends on this choice being true in order for the evidence provided to support the conclusion.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThe argument is about the quality of yarn as defined by \"strength and freedom from flaws.\" So, it certainly does not depend on there being other \"properties that can be used in judging the quality of yarn.\"\n\n\n\nThis choice is vaguely related to the argument but goes off in a different direction, the topic of what Moorhead Mill's yarn is intended for.\n\nIf the conclusion of the argument were about whether Moorhead should improve the quality of its yarn or whether Costello will sell more yarn or something else about the two mills competing in the marketplace, then the argument might depend on what this choice says.\n\nHowever, the argument is simply about the cause of the difference in quality of the yarns, and arriving at the conclusion does not depend on any assumption about prices or what markets the yarns are intended for.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is a trap choice. If we weren't paying close attention, we could get the sense that the argument is that Moorhead Mill SHOULD USE Costello Mill's process. In that case, it might make sense that the author would assume that the treatment that the Costello Mill uses is no more costly than the treatment that the Moorhead Mill uses. After, cost would be a factor in determining which treatment a mill should use.\n\nHowever, since the conclusion is not that Moorhead Mill should use Costello Mill's process but rather simply that the difference in treatment is the cause of the difference in quality, the argument does not depend on what this choice says.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is a trap. It gives us material for creating a story about the two mills. Maybe we start thinking something along the lines of that the difference in quality of the two mills' yarns has something to do with a difference in output of the two mills.\n\nFor instance, we could think, \"Maybe Moorhead Mill would produce more yarn by producing yarn faster and, as a result, would produce yarn of lower quality than Costello Mill's yarn. So, the author must be assuming that the Moorhead Mill does NOT have a significantly larger annual output of yarn. Otherwise, there would be an alternative cause of the difference in quality of the yarns, and that alternative cause would be faster production.\"\n\nTo avoid making up such a story, we can do two things.\n\nOne is to see that we really don't have support for such a story. In other words, we have no clear reason to believe that faster production or greater output would result in lower quality yarn.\n\nThe other is to see that the passage states that \"Costello Mill's process differs from the Moorhead Mill's only in the way that the raw wool is treated before spinning.\" So, we know for a fact that, even if this choice is not true and the Moorhead Mill DOES have a significantly larger annual output, the processes the mills use are still the same.\n\nSo, the argument does not depend on what this choice says since the conclusion about the cause of the difference in quality doesn't depend on assuming anything the outputs of yarn of the two mills.\n\nEliminate.\n\nWe see that the only choice that works is  .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "In 1563, in Florence's Palazzo Vecchio, Giorgio Vasari built in front of an existing wall a new wall on which he painted a mural. Investigators recently discovered a gap between Vasari's wall and the original, large enough to have preserved anything painted on the original. Historians believe that Leonardo da Vinci had painted, but left unfinished, a mural on the original wall; some historians had also believed that by 1563 the mural had been destroyed. However, it is known that in the late 1560s, when renovating another building, Santa Maria Novella, Vasari built a façade over its frescoes, and the frescoes were thereby preserved. Thus, Leonardo's Palazzo Vecchio mural probably still exists behind Vasari's wall.\n\nWhich of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "We'll want to keep in mind that for assumption questions, we aren't just looking for something that adds validity to the argument, instead, we want something that must be true for the argument to make sense. So, if we break down the construction of the argument:\n\nPremise: A gap has been discovered between Vasari's wall and the original wall\nPremise: Da Vinci was believe to have painted, but left unfinished a mural on the original wall\nPremise: In a different situation, Vasari built a facade that preserved the frescoes behind the facade\nConclusion: Leonardo's mural likely still exists behind the wall\n\nWe're looking for something that  to connect the use of the frescoes example to the assumed same use of the space between the walls. Here, we're assuming the space was set for the same reason as the facade over the fresnoes - to preserve what's behind it. Let's take a look at the answer choices!\n\nA. Leonardo rarely if ever destroyed artworks that he left unfinished. \nB. Vasari was likely unaware that the mural in the Palazzo Vecchio had willingly been abandoned by Leonardo. \nC. Vasari probably would not have built the Palazzo Vecchio wall with a gap behind it except to preserve something behind the new wall. \nD. Leonardo would probably have completed the Palazzo Vecchio mural if he had had the opportunity to do so. \nE. When Vasari preserved the frescoes of Santa Maria Novella he did so secretly. \n\nSo, in this case, answer  is the only one that  to connect the premises to the conclusion. If Vasari would have created the gap for any other reason than to preserve what was behind the wall, it wouldn't make sense to use that premise, and the example that he preserved the frescoes behind his facade to draw the conclusion that a mural likely exists behind the wall.\n\nKeep in mind, several of these answer choices certainly strengthened in one way or another, but only one  for the argument to have the potential to be valid. Strengtheners can be some of the most convincing wrong answers for assumption questions. So, we can always test answer choices to the question \"does this have to be true for the argument to make sense\" (or, more directly, apply the negation technique) to differentiate between the correct answer, and convincing wrong answers. \n\nHope this helps!",

Recent data shows that temperatures of the air surrounding the mountain’s glaciers never rise above freezing, so the glaciers cannot be melting. The loss must be explained by sublimation, or direct evaporation of the ice, and by not enough snowfall to replenish it.\n\nWhich of the following is an assumption the earth scientist’s argument requires?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The argument works as follows.\n\nIt begins with background information:\n\n\n\nThen, comes the main conclusion:\n\n\n\nNext comes factual evidence:\n\n\n\nFinally, we have two intermediate conclusions:\n\n\n\nSo, the factual evidence supports the intermediate conclusions, which in turn support the main conclusion that the loss cannot be due to global warming.\n\n\n\nThis is an Assumption question. So, the correct answer will be state something that must be true for the argument to work. In other words, the correct answer will be information necessary for the evidence to support the conclusion.\n\n\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is basically that global warming is not the explanation for the ice cover's disappearance.\n\nSo, the argument does not require assuming that, if things were different, global warming would be the explanation.\n\nEliminate\n\n\n\nThis choice is tempting because the passage says, \"Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania has lost  of its ice cover over the past century,\" and \" by sublimation, or direct evaporation of the ice, and  to replenish it.\"\n\nAt the same time, the argument does not require this choice because it doesn't have to be the case that the reason Mount Kilimanjaro has lost 90 percent of its ice cover is that annual snowfall has declined by 90 percent. After all, the ice cover could have decreased by 90 percent over time by declining a little each year, in other words, possibly because annual snowfall has decreased by a small percentage.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nAs we saw in our above analysis of the structure of the argument, the main conclusion is supported by the intermediate conclusion \"The loss must be explained by sublimation, or direct evaporation of the ice, and by not enough snowfall to replenish it.\"\n\nSo, the argument jumps from \"The loss must be explained by sublimation ... and by not enough snowfall,\" to the main conclusion \"this loss cannot be due to global warming.\"\n\nWe see that the argument relies on the assumption stated by this choice for that jump to work. After all, if the sublimation and lack of snowfall CAN be due to global warming, then the argument doesn't work since, in that case, the intermediate conclusion that the decrease in ice cover is the result of sublimation and lack of snowfall doesn't mean the loss cannot be due to global warming.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThis choice is tempting because the conclusion is \"this loss (of ice on Mount Kilimanjaro) cannot be due to global warming.\" So, we might think the support for the conclusion requires this choice.\n\nHowever, the truth is that this choice goes farther than what must be assumed for the argument to work. After all, the argument doesn't require assuming that global warming has not had \"any effect\" on Mount Kilimanjaro. Global warming could have had some effect and still not be the cause of the 90 percent decrease in ice cover.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nWe don't need to assume that sublimation and a lack of snowfall explain the loss of ice cover on other mountains to conclude that they explain the loss of ice cover on Kilimanjaro.\n\nEliminate.\n\n C",

        "question": "To decrease the number of crimes in city Y, the city's Police Commissioner proposed taking some police officers from low-crime districts of the city and moving them to high-crime districts of the city. His proposal is based on city Y crime data that show that the number of crimes in any district of the city decreases when additional police officers are moved into that district. \n\nThe Police Commissioner's proposal depends on which of the following assumptions?  \n \n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "The Police Commissioner's proposal hopes to decrease the number of crimes in city Y by shifting police officers from low-crime to high-crime districts. His proposal is based on data that demonstrate that crime decreases when additional police officers are moved into a district. However, the data do not mention anything about the effect on the districts from which the police officers were removed. The commissioner's plan is based on the assumption that the movement of police officers will not have any adverse effects on the low-crime districts.\n\n(A) While it is encouraging that a similar plan worked successfully in City X, this fact is certainly not essential for the success of the plan in City Y. The cities may be so different as to make the comparison meaningless. (B) The police commissioner's proposal is focused solely on decreasing the number of crimes in city Y. The severity of the crimes has no bearing on whether the commissioner's proposal will succeed or not.\n\n(C) The actual numerical distinction between high and low-crime areas of the city is immaterial to the commissioner's proposal. For instance, if the number of crimes committed in all high crime districts was only double (instead of more than triple) the number of crimes committed in low crime districts, the proposal could still be valid.\n\n(D) It would be practically beneficial to the commissioner's plan if there were more low crime than high crime districts in city Y. This would enable the movement of police officers to every high crime district. However, this is not necessary to achieve the commissioner's goal of decreasing the total number of crimes in city Y. Even if there were more high-crime districts than low-crime districts in city Y, police officers could still be shifted to some (though not all) high-crime districts, and thereby possibly reduce the total number of crimes in city Y.\n\nThe police commissioner's proposal would not make sense if districts of the city from which police officers are removed experience significant crime increases shortly after the removal of those officers. This would at least partially, if not fully, negate the reduction in the number of crimes in the high-crime districts. This choice establishes that, in fact, the low-crime districts do NOT suffer from significant crime increases after the removal of some officers-- an essential assumption upon which the commissioner's proposal depends.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

Let's say a person drives 100 kilometers a week, but now as the car runs 200 kilometers on the same amount of fuel, the person may drive the car more than earlier. \nIf people use the car as much as they do now -&gt; Energy consumption goes down.\nIf people use the car more than they do now -&gt; Energy consumption goes up.\n\n- This information is not necessary and does not impact the premise in any way.

        "question": "Cool Games Corporation derives all of its revenues through the sales of video games. Last year, it fell just short of making a profit although it had strong revenues of $200 million worldwide, half from children and half from adults. This year, the company’s sales to children rose 20% to $120 million, but its sales to adults dropped 40% to a disappointing $60 million. One of the most renowned Wall Street analysts had forecasted that Cool Games Corporation would need to at least match its revenues of last year in order to have a chance to make a profit on video games this year. Upon hearing the news of the Cool Games Corporation’s revenue, the analyst concluded that it was not possible for the company to have made a profit this year. \n\nThe analyst’s conclusion is based on which of the following assumptions? \n\n",

        "explanation": "The key to this question is noticing the difference between the revenue and profit. The revenue from last year was 200 million. However, this doesn’t tell us much about profit, which is how much a company makes after operation costs/expenses. \n\nIn this case, the video game company’s revenue may have been lower for this year, yet if its total expenses were less than those of last year, the company may end up being more profitable this year. \n\nWhat does this depend on? On whether the amount the company lost in revenue (20 million according to the numbers) is less than what the company saved in total expenses. \n\nSo if the company costs 100 million to operate the first year, then as long as its total costs were &lt;80 million, (or decreased by more than 20 million) it will be more profitable. \n\nThe analyst, in stating that the company is unable to make a profit, is assuming that its total costs did not decrease by more than 20 million.

        "explanation": "So the officials are saying that night flights have been coming since the beginning i.e. 20 yrs ago. So people should not have bought houses here if night flights were disruptive to their sleep. But they are assuming that people bought houses in the last 20 years when they knew about the night flights. What if people had actually bought the houses more than 20 yrs ago? Airport officials have no answer for them. They are assuming that everyone who is complaining  had bought his/her house less than 20 yrs ago. Hence (B) is an assumption. \n\nOption (E) only says that people who buy houses near the airport have no choice - they just can't avoid buying near the airport - could be for whatever reasons - lower prices, higher availability etc. The point is that they knew before buying that they are compromising by taking next to the airport. They pay for what they get. After getting the house, they cannot complain of the night flights (perhaps because of which the price they paid was lower). No matter what their reason was for buying the house close to the airport, if they did, they knew that sleep will get disturbed. So now they cannot cry about the disturbance. Hence officials are not answerable to people who had no choice but had to buy near the airport. So (E) is not an assumption.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

The statement is a conclusion, but the only support offered for this conclusion is that humans have evolved very little since the development of agriculture. Since this fact contradicts what is stated in the answer choice, the answer choice is incorrect. \n\nAnswer choice (B): Since we know the statement is a sub-conclusion, there is justification provided and this answer choice is incorrect. Note that describing the statement as a premise is also accurate, since a sub-conclusion is a conclusion for one argument and a premise for another argument. \n\nAnswer choice (C): The main conclusion does not explain the statement referenced in the question stem, so this answer choice is incorrect. The answer would be much improved if it said: “It is a phenomenon that helps explain the main conclusion of the nutritionist’s argument.” \n\n, and the answer you should have been looking for after you analyzed the argument and read the question stem. \n\nAnswer choice (E): This is a Reverse answer.

        "explanation": ": something fundamental that we do not question. This would be somewhat stronger than a fact because it is not specific to a limited number of cases but instead, apply to a broader range of scenarios(and often deeper in meaning). For instance, you will not talk about the principle that crime is increasing in large cities. Instead, it is a  which applies to large cities. However, you will talk about the principles of Physics or the fundamental principles of Human Rights. I believe principles convey a stronger connotation than mere facts.\n\n\n\n: something taken as true at face value (stats, historical events)\n\n\n\n: what is used to support a conclusion (examples, stats, historical events). Although these may include facts, it is usually stronger than facts because they are  elements needed for the conclusion to stand whereas facts are not necessary for the latter to stand\n\n\n\n: This is a bit of a stretch. It will not often be on the test but it seems very similar to \"background\" information as described below.\n\n\n\n: Elements needed to put the evidence into context but which, as stand alone pieces of information, might not constitute what is called an evidence necessary to arrive at a conclusion. For instance, blood tests performed on one thousand persons may reveal that 35% of those persons were HIV infected. However, the background information could be that the test was performed in more underinformed regions of the world where AIDS knowledge is at a minimum. As you can see, the fact that the test was performed in more underinformed regions is not in and of itself an evidence because it does not allow us to come to a conclusion. Instead, the 35% stats, as a stand-alone piece of info, is what will lead us to the conclusion we want. However, the background info is also crucial and cannot be omitted; it is required background info.\n\n\n\n: Something which was taken into account or given some thought before arriving to the conclusion.\n\n\n\n: This is usually a required statement to arrive at a conclusion. Evidence and facts want to prove something to you whereas premises are there to logically lead you to a conclusion. The best example of premises is the ones included in syllogisms. For instance, you can say that(premise1) when it rains, you go outside. Then, it rains(premise2). You have to be outside(conclusion).\n\n\n\n: Unstated information which will link the argument to a logical conclusion. Without this, the argument falls apart.\n\n\n\n: Self-explanatory\n\n\n\n: Something that might not be explicitly stated or proved. For instance, you may say that 95% of GMAT test-takers have over 340. We can reasonably infer that Anthony will get more than 340 on his GMAT based on the fact given. I think the main difference b/w an inference and a conclusion is that the former might not be the final line of an argument. For instance, there could be facts/evidence given, an inference in b/w, and then the conclusion. An inference can be an intermediate step before the conclusion which will sum up the whole passage. Also, a conclusion seems to be stronger because it is based on stronger facts/evidence. As in my previous example, we can reasonably  that Anthony got 340+ on his GMAT but we cannot  that he got 340+. See the nuance?\n\n\n\nFeel free to disagree or add your thoughts to what I said. Some of these have very subtle differences though and in some cases, can even be interchanged.",

The author opposes that position, so the first half of (A) looks good. The 2nd BF portion is not evidence. Instead, it is simply the author's position/conclusion. By itself, this statement does not undermine support for investor's position. The second half of (A) is inaccurate, so eliminate this one.\n\nAs in choice (A), the first half of (B) looks good. But, again, the 2nd BF portion is not evidence. Also, this statement in no way supports the investor's position. Instead, the 2nd BF portion is simply the author's conclusion (that the investor's claim is  justified). Eliminate (B).\n\nAs in (A) and (B), the first half of (C) looks good. The 2nd BF portion is the author's conclusion, so the second half of (C) looks good too. Choice (C) accurately expresses the roles of the two boldfaced portions, so keep this one.\n\nThe 1st BF portion, \"the company is mismanaged\", is the  of the prominent investor, not evidence to support the investor's position. The evidence cited to support that position is \"the company's failure to slow production in response to a recent rise in its inventory of finished products\", and this portion is not boldfaced.\n\nThe 2nd BF portion does not undermine the evidence cited above (\"the company's failure to slow production in response to a recent rise in its inventory of finished products\"). Stating that the investor's sniping was not justified does not, by itself, undermine the evidence. Rather, the 2nd BF portion is the conclusion of the author's argument. Eliminate (D).\n\nThe 1st BF portion is not evidence supporting the investor's position. Instead, it is simply the investor's position. The second half of (E) is okay, but since the first is inaccurate, (E) must be eliminated.\n\n(C) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

Specifically, it asks us to determine the relationship of the two bolded sentences to the argument as a whole. To do this effectively, we need first to determine the conclusion of the argument. In this case, the conclusion is the final sentence, which follows from the evidence presented in the rest of the argument. So we know that the correct answer cannot describe either bolded portion as the author's final conclusion. \n\nThe first bolded portion is presented as an earlier, erroneous belief. In evaluating the answer choices, we should look to eliminate any that suggest the author agrees with this first statement. The second bolded statement shows that the earlier theory (that lactic acid causes soreness) was incorrect, and thus also provides evidence in support of the author's conclusion. So we know that the correct answer must describe the second bolded portion as supporting the conclusion. The correct answer must describe both portions correctly, not just one or the other. \n\n(A) This choice misrepresents the first bolded portion by claiming that the author accepts it as true, when the author actually presents it as an incorrect, outdated belief. The second portion is also incorrect because it indicates that the second bolded portion supports the first one. \n\n(B) This choice also misrepresents the first portion, for the reason described above. It corrects the second bolded portion, however, by describing it as contradictory to the first portion. \n\n(C) The first portion is correctly described as an assertion that the author does not believe to be true. Yet the second portion is incorrectly described as going against the author's final conclusion. \n\n This choice correctly represents the first portion by saying the author believes it is no longer valid. The second portion is correctly described as evidence in support of the author's conclusion. \n\n(E) The first portion is correctly described as evidence considered by the author to be invalid. However, this choice misrepresents the second portion as the conclusion, when it is actually evidence given in support of the conclusion.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "However, this quarter, the release of data about strong GDP growth is most likely to result in a decrease rather than an increase in stock prices.  \n\nIn the above argument, the statements in boldface play which of the following roles?\n\n\nA.

The first is a generalization that the chief economist accepts as true; the second is a consequence that follows from that generalization.\n\nD. The first is evidence that the chief economist provides in support of a certain prediction; the second is that prediction.\n\nE. The first is a pattern of cause and effect that the chief economist predicts will be repeated in the case at issue; the second acknowledges a circumstance in which that pattern would not hold.\n\n\nMain CR Qs link - \n\n\nThe chief economist begins his argument by describing the usual relationship of cause and effect. Thus, the first statement in boldface represents a generalization that the chief economist accepts as accurate. The economist then goes on to conclude that this time, however, the usual cause-and-effect relationship will not hold and strong figures of the GDP will cause a decrease rather than an increase in stock prices. To support this conclusion, the economist offers evidence explaining how strong GDP figures may lead to lower stock prices. Therefore, the second statement in boldface represents evidence that supports the main conclusion of the economist.  \n\n(A) This answer choice correctly describes the role of the first statement but incorrectly states that the second statement in boldface represents the conclusion of the economist rather than the evidence that supports that conclusion. Remember, the conclusion of the economist is that strong GDP figures will result in a decrease rather than an increase in stock prices.  \n \n This answer choice correctly identifies the role of each of the two parts in boldface. The first part represents a generalization that is typically accurate but will not be repeated in the case at issue. The second portion presents evidence in support of the economist’s prediction.  \n \n(C) This answer choice correctly describes the role of the first portion but mistakenly states that the second part in boldface follows from this generalization. The second statement in boldface presents evidence that supports the opposite effect from that described in the first portion. Namely, the economist claims that this time, stock prices will decrease rather than increase, as would be usual.  \n \n(D) This answer choice incorrectly states that the first portion supports rather than weighs against that economist’s prediction. In addition, this answer choice incorrectly states that the second portion in boldface represents the economist's prediction rather than evidence supporting it.  \n \n(E) This answer choice incorrectly states that the first statement will be repeated in the case at issue. Remember, the economist argues that the usual pattern will not hold this time. The second statement is correctly described as acknowledging a circumstance in which the usual pattern will not hold.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The correct answer choice is (C). \n\nThe causal relationship in this problem appears in the premise, and the argument is structured as follows: Premise: Most antidepressant drugs cause weight gain. Premise: Dieting can help reduce the amount of weight gained while taking such antidepressants. Conclusion: Some weight gain is unlikely to be preventable. Note that the causal premise specifically states that “most” antidepressants cause weight gain, not necessarily all antidepressants. Also, the second premise specifically refers to antidepressants causing weight gain (the use of “such” indicates this). The second premise also indicates that the amount gained can be reduced, not that dieting can stop weight gain. Perhaps the antidepressants cause a twenty pound weight gain, but dieting can reduce that to a ten pound total gain. The question stem is a Must Be True, and thus you must accept the stimulus information and find an answer that is proven by that information. \n\nAnswer choice (A): This is an Exaggerated answer. The stimulus indicates that most antidepressants cause weight gain, leaving open the possibility that some do not. This answer choice references any antidepressant drug. Further, the stimulus does not address the role of a physician or the advisability of prescribing certain drugs under certain conditions. The benefits of prescribing an antidepressant that causes weight gain to an overweight patient may well outweigh the negatives (pun intended). \n\nAnswer choice (B): This is also an exaggerated answer. The stimulus allows for antidepressants that do not cause weight gain. \n\n Some individuals taking antidepressants that cause weight gain will gain weight even though dieting can reduce the amount of the gain. \n\nAnswer choice (D): This is an Opposite answer. The stimulus and correct answer both indicate that people taking the weight gain-causing antidepressants will gain weight regardless of whether they diet. Thus, the weight gain cannot be attributed to a lack of dieting. \n\nAnswer choice (E): This answer is too strong. Not all patients necessarily take antidepressants that cause weight gain, so those that do not might not need to diet to maintain their weight.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "answer": "Added OA",
        "explanation": "From the stimulus we dont know anything about cold weather.So how are we able to comment on what the advantages or disadvantages of adding ethanol to gasoline are in cold weather.\n\nCan you please help in clarifying this? How C is the right answer here.\n\nWhat am I missing here.OK, so here's what we've got:\n\n and during . When the weather is  hot, evaporative emissions pose less of a pollution problem than exhaust emissions.\n\nOur job is the fill in the blank, based on what the author has already said. Well, if air pollution is the only thing that we care about, then we know the author prefers evaporative emissions over exhaust emissions,  in hot weather (especially in hot weather within big cities). So just by reading the text, we can infer the author will prefer adding ethanol to gas  in hot weather (especially in hot weather within big cities).\n\nAddressing your concern about cold weather, recall that the author writes:\n\n, evaporative emissions pose less of a pollution problem than exhaust emissions.\".This is the opposite of what the author would like! We know that ethanol leads to more smog in large cities during hot summer months. The author would not recommend adding ethanol only to gasoline intended for use in these cities without some kind of targeted timing for  the ethanol is added. But this choice doesn't give us that kind of detail, so we eliminate (A).\n\nThis is also the opposite of what the author has written so far. The author says that  in hot weather, evaporative emissions pose  of a pollution threat than exhaustive emissions. Eliminate (B).\n\nThis looks good! When considering pollution, the author believes that the disadvantages of adding ethanol to gas match or outweigh the advantages in hot weather. Choice (C) states that the advantages of adding ethanol to gas (lower exhaust emissions) likely outweigh the disadvantages (slightly higher evaporative emissions), at least in cold weather (when there's less risk of the evaporative emissions contributing to smog). Let's keep (C) around.\n\nThe author has spent the entire passage discussing how we can use ethanol to reduce exhaust emissions, in the context of a \"pollution problem.\" Given that pollution is the only consideration for our answer, this would contradict, not complete, everything the author has already written. Eliminate (D).\n\nLike (A), this choice says the opposite of what the author has stated. Adding ethanol to gasoline in the cities in hot weather would contribute to smog, which is a form of air pollution. The end result would be lower air quality, not higher air quality. So eliminate (E).\n\n(C) is the best choice available. I hope this helped clear up the air around this question!

What's generally wrong with those answers is that they don't hit the argument's specific plan working with the argument's specific group.  Here in this argument we don't know whether transportation workers have specific skills or qualifications that makes them more worthy of a higher raise (clearly doctors vs. minimum wage workers would expect higher increases; what about transportation workers?), so A isn't able to make a direct case that a $2/hour range is even an option for the workers in question, or that the workers in question had even been trying to negotiate for a raise (we know housing advocates were, but we don't know whether the grounds crew union was actively pushing for a raise).  In general, be wary of the maybe analogous, maybe not group or plan...do they really impact this one?\n\nAnother thing we like to say at Veritas Prep is \"the existence of a better plan doesn't weaken this plan\" in \"Weaken the Plan\" questions.  Yeah $2/hour would be a better increase than $1/hour, but why here - again, we don't know that they even asked for a raise - would you reject a raise of any kind?  B gives that reason: hey, actually that raise comes at a big cost for these people - there's a chance that they end up worse off than they were before.  When you're asked to weaken a plan, you want to show that the plan has a chance to 1) not work at all or 2) be counterproductive.  And here B shows that it would be counterproductive.  \n\nSo basically:\n\nA suggests that there might be a better plan \n\nB shows that THIS plan could be entirely counterproductive.  \n\nIn weaken-the-plan questions, the answer that shows a direct reason why THIS plan won't work in THIS situation is the right answer.",

This choice supports the existing reason (high initial costs) by providing another practical and relevant reason why widespread adoption is slow: the cheaper and quicker alternatives available in the form of traditional roofing. It is a great fit. \n\n\n\nThis is the opposite of what we are looking for (strengthens the argument for adoption).

Wood, rock, glass and every other building material is sources from forests, quaries, factories, etc which are far away from urban centers, yet somehow construction companies manage to procure them and it is not a problem. It is not like someone goes to pick up a bottle of milk and also grabs a green roof at their neighborhood store. This \"problem\" is a dubious claim.

        "question": "Which of the following most logically completes the passage?\n\nThe figures in portraits by the Spanish painter El Greco (1541–1614) are systematically elongated. In El Greco’s time, the intentional distortion of human figures was unprecedented in European painting. Consequently, some critics have suggested that El Greco had an astigmatism, a type of visual impairment, that resulted in people appearing to him in the distorted way that is characteristic of his paintings. However, this suggestion cannot be the explanation, because______________.\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "First, let’s consider the structure of the passage:\n\nThe fact that artists, hundreds of years after Greco, adopted Greco’s painting style does not necessarily suggest that Greco did not have an astigmatism. It indicates that it’s possible to paint elongated figures without a visual impairment, but it still does nothing to suggest that an astigmatism cannot explain Greco’s style. Eliminate (A).\n\nEven if  people have elongated bodies like those in Greco’s portraits, the figures in Greco’s paintings are  elongated. Moreover, (B) only indicates that  people’s bodies are  like those in Greco’s portraits. The force of the evidence provided by (B) is weak, and it certainly is not strong enough to conclude that an astigmatism  explain the elongated figures in Greco’s paintings. Eliminate (B).\n\n(C) suggests that if Greco really had an astigmatism, then the elongated figures in his paintings would look different than the figures he saw in real life. This is interesting because the entire premise of the other critics’ argument is that Greco painted the way that he did because it would have matched how he saw people in everyday life. If this is not the case, then the elongated figures in Greco’s paintings would have looked unprecedented to him too. This means that Greco did not paint the way that he did merely because of his astigmatism. And an astigmatism would not explain Greco’s style. Let’s keep (C).\n\nIf there was no correction for astigmatism available when Greco lived, we have all the more reason to believe that it’s possible that an astigmatism affected Greco’s paintings. This is the opposite of what the author is arguing, so we can eliminate (D).\n\n(E) is tempting. It suggests that it’s possible Greco was influenced by non-European artists who included intentionally distorted figures in their works. The problem is that this does not support the force with which the author argues for his/her conclusion. Sure, Greco could have been influenced by non-Europeans, but that doesn’t mean that an astigmatism CANNOT explain the elongated figures. Eliminate (E).\n\n(C) is the only answer choice remaining, and it is correct.\n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

Perhaps drivers in the continental US who use their headlights are slightly LESS likely to become involved in a collision. The information in the passage does not strongly suggest whether (A) is true, so eliminate this one.\n\nWe are not given information to compare the effect of poor daylight visibility to other factors that lead to automobile collisions. Daylight visibility might be a relatively minor factor or it might be a major factor. We don't know either way, so eliminate (B).\n\nWe know that headlight laws CAN prevent collisions, but this does not allow us to compare collision rates in the US to collision rates in countries that have such laws. For example, perhaps Canada has headlight laws but still has a higher proportion of collisions than the US. Without headlight laws, Canada would probably have an even HIGHER proportion of collisions. In other words, headlight laws might reduce the rate of collision in Canada, but we don't know how that reduced rate compares to the rate in the US. Eliminate (C).\n\nAgain, headlight laws can REDUCE the risk of collisions, but we don't have enough information to compare the number of collisions in the continental US to the number of collisions in countries with daytime headlight laws. For reasons similar to those discussed for option (C), choice (D) should be eliminated.\n\nWe know that the laws are MORE effective the farther away you move from the equator. Since the only countries that currently have such laws are farther from the equator than the continental US, we can infer that the laws would be more effective in those countries than in the continental US.\n\nChoice (E) can be properly inferred and is the best conclusion based on the information in the passage.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

The second sentence's statement that Amy is the tennis captain and therefore must have a 2.5 doesn't support the GPA requirement for participation. Rather the fact that Amy must have at least a 2.5 is a result of the GPA requirement in the first sentence.\n\nAs such, the main point will be the second sentence. All we need now is a restatement of the second sentence.\n\nA) Restates first sentence\nB) Outside the scope of the question. Being the tennis captain may mean Amy is a good tennis player but, as Amy's skill is never mentioned in the question, this choice will be wrong.\nC) Outside the scope. Lowering the GPA requirement is never mentioned in the question.\nD) Summarizes the second sentence. \nE) Leaves open multiple outcomes. We are never given the reason Amy was made captain in the question. All we know is that Amy's GPA is 2.5 or above.

        "question": "­Willett: Lopez and Simmons, a married couple, have both been offered jobs at Evritech Corporation. Because Evritech has a rule against hiring more than one member of the same family, Lopez and Simmons have decided to reveal their marriage to Evritech. Their decision is foolish , however, since it will mean that one of them will have a job offer withdrawn. After all, they could easily keep their marriage secret initially and, if they want, later claim to have married after they were hired: Evritech has no policy of terminating one of two employees who marry each other.­\n\nThe main conclusion of Willett's argument is that\n",

The conclusion will generally be a judgment, prediction, plan, or explanation.\n\nAdditionally, a Premise Marker like \"since\" is often attached to the conclusion, with a structure like \"Since (premise), therefore (conclusion)\".  Or vice versa, \"(conclusion), since (premise)\"\n\nHere, the 3rd sentence says: \" , however,  it will mean that one of them will have a job offer withdrawn.\"\n\n\"Their decision is foolish\" is clearly a judgment/opinion, and therefore is the conclusion. Additionally, a premise to support it follows, with the common Premise Marker, \"since\".\n\n\nNext, let's make sure we understand the details of what \"their decision\" is referring to, in the prior sentence:\n\n\"Lopez and Simmons have decided to reveal their marriage to Evritech\".\n\n\nNext, we can go to the answer choices, and one will match with \"their decision is foolish\", potentially with additional details.\n\n\n\nFrom our analysis above, \"Lopez and Simmons would be unwise to reveal their marriage to Evritech Corporation\" is a perfect match.\n\nHowever, we should always make sure that the entire choice fits, to avoid a trap. What about the end of the choice, \"without having already started to work there\"?\n\nLet's go back and re-read the 4th sentence of the passage:\n\n \"they could easily keep their marriage secret initially and, if they want, later claim to have married after they were hired\"\n\nSo, the author's full conclusion includes the additional point that they could claim to have married after they were hired.\n\nTherefore, all of choice C matches, and we can safely choose it.\n\n\nNone of the other choices match the content of the passage:\n\n\n\nThe author's criticism was about the decision to reveal their marriage, not the applications themselves.\n\n\n\n\nThe author does not say that the rule is \"often not enforced\"\n\n\n\n\nThe author makes no judgment about what \"Evritech\" should do. The author was critical of the couple's decision to reveal their marriage.\n\n\n\n\nThe author makes no explicit judgment about the  of Evritech discovering their marital status. \n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

Unfortunately, the tulu is easily devastated by a contagious fungal rot.

        "question": "Journalist: A free marketplace of ideas ensures that all ideas get a fair hearing. Even ideas tainted with prejudice and malice can prompt beneficial outcomes. In most countries, however, the government is responsible for over half the information released to the public through all media. For this reason, the power of governments over information needs to be curtailed. Everyone grants that governments should not suppress free expression, yet governments continue to construct near monopolies on the publication and dissemination of enormous amounts of information.\n\nWhich one of the following most accurately expresses the conclusion of the journalist’s argument?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The conclusion to this argument is the fourth sentence, which begins with the conclusion indicator “For this reason...” By applying the Primary Objectives you should have identified this conclusion while reading, and then, upon classifying the question stem you should have looked for a paraphrase of this sentence. Answer choice (C) fits the bill, and is the correct answer. \n\nAnswer choice (A): The author would agree with this statement but this is not the Main Point of the argument; rather, it is closer to a premise that might support the conclusion. Incidentally, the author’s general agreement with this answer choice is signaled by the use of “however” in the third sentence. In the stimulus, the author begins by mentioning that a free marketplace of ideas, including dangerous ideas, ensures a fair hearing of ideas. In the third sentence, the author then says, “however, the government is responsible for over half the information released to the public,” indicating the author feels the government is a threat to this free marketplace. \n\nAnswer choice (B): The author would also agree with this statement, but again this is not the Main Point of the argument. As discussed in the analysis of answer choice (A), the author believes that the freedom of the marketplace of ideas is at risk, and in stating that we should curtail the government’s power over information, the author assumes that preserving a free marketplace of ideas is important. Thus this answer choice would be better described as an unstated premise that supports the conclusion. \n\n Remember, any answer that is a paraphrase of the conclusion of the argument will be the correct answer to a Main Point question. \n\nAnswer choice (D): The stimulus specifically notes that malicious or prejudicial ideas can “prompt beneficial outcomes.” The outcome of an idea is different than stating the ideas themselves “can be valuable.” \n\nAnswer choice (E): The stimulus states that “governments continue to construct near monopolies on the publication and dissemination of enormous amounts of information.” This phrasing is not the same as answer choice (E), which asserts that the government already has a monopoly on the dissemination of many kinds of information. The lesson learned from this particular problem is that you must isolate the conclusion and then look for a paraphrase of that conclusion.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "Psychologists conducted an experiment in which half of the volunteers were asked to describe an unethical action they had performed, while the other half were asked to describe an ethical action they had performed. Some of the volunteers, chosen at random from each of the two groups, were encouraged to wash their hands afterward. Among those who described unethical actions, those who washed their hands were significantly less likely to volunteer for another, similar experiment than those who did not wash their hands. The researchers concluded that some of the subjects failed to volunteer again in part because of their having described an unethical action.\n\nWhich of the following would, if true, most help to support the researchers' conclusion?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Researchers found that some participants in the first experiment were more likely to volunteer for a second experiment.\n\nWhat led to that finding?\n.\n\nBut what does the evidence say?\n and choosing to volunteer again, but the researchers do NOT address that correlation.\n\nNow, the question becomes how we can support the conclusion that the primary issue is the ethical/unethical storytelling, NOT the hand-washing.\n\nSo, we’re looking for an answer choice that can both disentangle these two variables (hand-washing and ethical/unethical storytelling) and support the idea that describing an unethical action discouraged volunteers from volunteering again.\n\nWith that in mind, let’s take a look at the answer choices:\n\nIf (A) is true, then the likelihood volunteers choose to volunteer again appears to depend, in part, on whether they washed their hands. But even then, the researchers conclusion is about the impact of describing an unethical action, not washing hands. Eliminate (A).\n\n(B) is interesting. If the likelihood of volunteering again is higher among those who described ethical actions than those who described unethical actions, then it seems to be true that the type of action described by a volunteer has an impact on his/her choice to volunteer again. Moreover, (B) removes the second variable, hand-washing, that would otherwise influence the decision to volunteer again. So, (B) both eliminates a possible alternative explanation for the decision to volunteer again and provides support for the researchers’ explanation of the decision to volunteer again. Let’s keep (B).\n\nThe researchers’ conclusion focuses on the impact of describing an unethical action on choosing to volunteer again. Relatively little support is given for that conclusion, but even that support is not related to the choices of volunteers that washed or did not wash their hands. For that reason, (C) is irrelevant, and we can eliminate it.\n\nAgain, despite the large quantity of information given in the passage about volunteers washing their hands, that information has little to do with the researchers’ conclusion.

        "question": "Sasha: It must be healthy to follow a diet high in animal proteins and fats. Human beings undoubtedly evolved to thrive on such a diet, since our prehistoric ancestors ate large amounts of meat.\n\nJamal: But our ancestors also exerted themselves intensely in order to obtain this food, whereas most human beings today are much less physically active.\n\nJamal responds to Sasha by doing which of the following?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "- Sasha makes a claim (“must be healthy” clearly indicates a claim) that following a diet high in animal proteins and fats must be healthy.\n\n - This portion supports the claim made in the first statement (The way to read any passage is to connect every idea back to the previous ones. At every statement, you should ask yourself, “How is this connected with the context so far?”)\n\n - This portion supports the idea mentioned in the initial part of the sentence. Since our prehistoric ancestors ate a lot of meat, Sasha claims, human beings evolved to thrive on such a diet. (Since human beings evolved to thrive on a diet of meat, a diet high in animal proteins and fats must be healthy.)\n\n - Jamal starts his statement with a ‘but’ that indicates he is going to oppose some aspect of Sasha’s statement. Jamal points out a difference between human beings today and our ancestors – the level of physical exertion. (How does that impact Sasha’s point? Sasha’s argument was that what worked for our ancestors should work for us. By pointing out a difference between our ancestors and us, Jamal indicates that what worked for them may not work for us).\n\nThe one glaring gap in Sasha’s argument that can be exploited in multiple ways is that she assumed that what worked for our ancestors would work for us. What if there are differences between us and our ancestors such that what worked for them may not work for us? (Jamal indicates just this.)\n\nAnother gap in Sasha’s argument is that she assumes that just because our ancestors ate that diet, it was healthy for them. It is entirely possible that our ancestors ate a lot of meat probably because they didn’t have an option, not because it was healthy for them. If meat was not even healthy for our ancestors, Sasha’s argument would be junk.\n\nWe have to find an option that tells us the way in which Jamal responds to Sasha. We have already discussed that Jamal points out a difference between us and our ancestors and thereby suggests that Sasha’s line of reasoning is not entirely correct.\n\n\n\n So, if you say that “XYZ is the best country”, qualifying your statement would mean adding exceptions or restrictions to this statement. A few examples of qualifying this statement would be:  “XYZ is the best in terms of educational standards”, “XYZ is the best if we do not include Switzerland and Poland in our consideration”, or “XYZ is the best except in October and November”.\n\nNow coming back to the option, is Jamal bringing some information that suggests that Sasha should add reservations to or exceptions to her main conclusion that it must be healthy to follow a diet high in animal proteins and fats? The answer is yes. Sasha should add a reservation by stating something like: following a diet high in animal proteins and fats must be healthy, except probably for people who work much less than our ancestors.\n\n\n\n\nWe regularly come across people who have trouble with questions, like this one, that are based on conversation. The primary difference between these conversation based questions and regular argument questions is that a regular argument generally has a unidirectional flow (a conclusion supported by some premises). On the other hand, these conversation based questions typically involve one person making the argument and then another person challenging that argument. Thus, reasoning exists both in favor and against a certain point. The challenge therefore becomes two-fold: to understand how the conclusion is supported and to understand how the conclusion (and its reasoning) is challenged.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

Really, the conclusion is baseless then because I know I won't make profit if I set up my business in the city, for I will have to sell my fishes at a much lower price. Even though I will pay lower taxes, what's the use if I make less profit on sale.\n\nAns: No!! Wow, that's wonderful. I will surely set up my shop in the city because the conclusion was indeed true. Now, I can sell the fishes at the same price as sub-urban sellers do. Plus, I pay less taxes than them.

They use this premise to arrive at the conclusion that this is only done to protect against mosquites. But adding this additional information that millipedes are only available during the rainy season cast doubt on this logic. It could now be that the only reason they rub them into their skin during the rainy season is because this is the only season they're available.

An analog dial or gauge can be marked with red to alert the operator when a value is entering a danger zone; a digital gauge cannot.

We might think that, if the percentage of the daily energy intake represented by ultra-processed foods is currently much lower for US adults than for adults in other countries, then the US government doesn’t have a good reason to warn citizens about the harms of consuming such foods.\n\nHowever, it remains the case that consumption of ultra-processed foods has been linked to various diseases yet has steadily increased from 53 percent to 57 percent of the daily energy intake of US adults since 2001. So, regardless of whether what this choice says is true, the US government still had good reason to warn the citizens about the harms of consuming such foods.\n\n\n\nThe answer to this question has no effect on the argument. After all, regardless of whether the main function of the government is to warn citizens about the harms of lifestyle choices, it could still make sense for the government to warn people about the harms of consuming ultra-processed foods.\n\n\n\nThe answer to this question makes a big difference. After all, the point of warning people about the harms of consuming ultra-processed foods is to make them aware of those adverse effects.\n\nSo, if the answer to this question is no, and consumption of ultra-processed food is NOT lower among those aware of its adverse effects, then maybe there’s no point to the government warning people about the harms of such foods, and the case for the conclusion is weakened.\n\nOn the other hand, if the answer to this question is yes, then we have more reason to believe that the government should warn people, since doing so could cause people to reduce their consumption of ultra-processed food.\n\n\n\nThis choice is a trap because we might get the sense that an increase in the total daily energy intake of an average US adult somehow makes a difference in the implications of the fact stated by the passage that the consumption of ultra-processed foods has steadily increased from 53 percent to 57 percent of the daily energy intake of US adults.\n\nHowever, the truth is that, regardless of whether the total daily energy intake of an average US adult has increased, it still remains the case that the proportion of food that US adults consume that’s represented by ultra-processed foods has increased. So, it would still make sense for the government to warn the citizens about the harms of consuming such food.\n\n\n\nRegardless of whether the cause  of the increase in consumption of ultra-processed foods is that they are designed to look and taste appealing, it could still help to warn people about the harms of consuming such foods.

Radio ads? Posters in public transit? Billboards? Ads in magazines? Web ads, such as Google ads?  We don't know.  For a web ad, it would be unusual if there weren't some clickable link.  Links sometimes appear in print ads, and rarely in TV and radio ads, and that's not necessarily a problem.  If people are motivated to action by a TV or radio ad, a simple websearch will reveal the nearest dealership.  This is not necessarily relevant at all.  \n\n(C) Bingo!  If people buying the TJ-700 point to the ads as what motivated the sale, then those are very effective ads.  Conversely, if people don't even remember the ads and, when asked what motivated the sale, point to other factors, then probably the ads were not particularly effective.  This is the crucial issue, right here.  \n\n(D) An interesting twist.  Certain maintenance costs, and how reliable each model is, would play some role in sales, but once again, money spent on advertising does not automatically result in higher quality ads.  This is not correct.  \n\n(E) We care much less about what buyers of other cars have seen.  What matters for the gigantic sales difference of the TJ-700 and Beta Turbomax is what has motivated the folks buying specifically those two models.

        "question": "In the past the country of Malvernia has relied heavily on imported oil. Malvernia recently implemented a program to convert heating systems from oil to natural gas. Malvernia currently produces more natural gas each year than it uses, and oil production in Malvernian oil fields is increasing at a steady pace. If these trends in fuel production and usage continue, therefore, Malvernian reliance on foreign sources for fuel is likely to decline soon.\n\nWhich of the following would it be most useful to establish in evaluating the argument?\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "A \"most useful to evaluate\" question is typically best approached from a weaken mindset.  Look to establish the conclusion and premises, decipher the gap in logic, and then think about how you would attack the gap.  The correct answer will be focused on one of the gaps in logic.\n\nHere the argument states that while Malvernia relied heavily on imported oil in the past, the company has implemented a program to convert heating systems from oil to natural gas, and the country is steadily increasing its oil production each year.  From these premises the argument concludes that, if these trends continue, Malvernia is likely to experience a reduced dependency on foreign oil in the future.  The primary gap in logic here is that this argument is focused on the supply of oil increasing and then one demand of the oil potentially decreasing (heating systems).  However, there could be many other oil demands that increase drastically, potentially more than offsetting these factors.  Answer D correctly addresses this, because if the amount of oil used for generating electricity and transportation increases greatly, Malvernia may end up depending even more on foreign oil, not less, and thus the conclusion would not hold.\n\nAnswer choice A is a pretty irrelevant comparison.  Even though Malvernia currently produces more natural gas than it uses, it may just use essentially zero natural gas.  Answer choice B is completely out of scope - other countries don't matter.  Answer choice C is also out of scope - the argument is not discussing alternative energy sources.  And answer choice E is irrelevant.  Knowing whether any systems have currently been converted (may 1 has, maybe 1,000,000 have) or not doesn't affect this argument.\n\nI hope this helps!",

        "question": "Ecological studies have shown that the current landfill that serves Sturgeon County is responsible for the vast majority of the county's groundwater pollution problem.  Surprisingly, however, Sturgeon County's leading environmentalists support a ballot initiative that will invest in the expansion of the current landfill, as opposed to another initiative that will invest the same amount of money in creating a new landfill that would have zero impact on the county's groundwater.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, serves as the best justification for the environmentalists' position?\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "This is an 'explain the discrepancy' problem - the indicators are the word \"surprisingly\" in the argument, the word \"justification\" in the question, and the fact that the argument doesn't include any support for the environmentalists' position. To solve this, you'll need to do two things: understand the environmentalists' position, and then find an answer choice that gives a good reason for them to take that position.\n\nThe environmentalists prefer the old landfill to the new landfill. So, the right answer will have to explain why, from an environmentalist's perspective, keeping the old landfill is good or creating a new landfill is bad. \n\n(E) shows that the new landfill is bad, but not from the perspective of the environmentalists. There isn't any logical reason for the environmentalists to care about the cost of the land. \n\n(D) tells us why the county might  the support of environmentalists. That's interesting, but the right answer has to tell you why the environmentalists actually did choose to give their support. It's not enough to just show that their support would be good, you have to explain why they give their support. \n\n(A) looks like it says that the old landfill is good. However, (A) doesn't actually give you good information about the rate of pollution. It's lower than initially reported, but since we don't know what the initially reported rate was, that doesn't mean anything to us. It could be quite low, or it could still be very high (but just a bit less high than we thought.)\n\n(C) is similar to (A). Since we don't know anything about the level of pollution from coal plants, we can't get any good info by comparing the groundwater pollution to it. The level of groundwater pollution could still be quite high, even if it's not as high as the coal pollution. Plus, the argument only gives us certain options: old landfill, or new landfill? This answer choice seems to suggest that we shouldn't be worrying about the landfills at all, which doesn't help us decide whether the old one or the new one is better. \n\nThat leaves (B). (B) is correct because it suggests that the environmentalists voted for the old landfill in order to ensure that it keeps being maintained, which will prevent pollution.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t | Manhattan Prep | Online tutoring and curriculum |  | Suggestions for blog articles are always welcome!",

        "question": "Community activist: If Morganville wants to keep its central shopping district healthy, it should prevent the opening of a huge SaveAll discount department store on the outskirts of Morganville. Records from other small towns show that whenever SaveAll has opened a store outside the central shopping district of a small town, within five years the town has experienced the bankruptcies of more than a quarter of the stores in the shopping district.\n\nThe answer to which of the following would be most useful for evaluating the community activist’s reasoning?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The passage begins with the conclusion: \"If Morganville wants to keep its central shopping district healthy, it should prevent the opening of a huge SaveAll discount department store on the outskirts of Morganville.\"\n\nThe activist bases this conclusion on the following evidence: \"Records from other small towns show that whenever SaveAll has opened a store outside the central shopping district of a small town, within five years the town has experienced the bankruptcies of more than a quarter of the stores in the shopping district.\"\n\nSure, this doesn't PROVE that the same thing will happen in Morganville. However, the evidence seems to suggest that if Morganville opens a SaveAll on the outskirts of town, then we would expect more than a quarter of the stores in the central shopping district to experience bankruptcy within five years.\n\nAccording to the author, these bankruptcies would indicate that the central shopping district is no longer healthy (here \"healthy\" means \"flourishing\" or \"prospering\"). The author believes that this effect can be avoided if the town prevents the SaveAll from opening.\n\nThe answer to which of the following would be most useful for evaluating the community activist’s reasoning?\n\nPerhaps community activists have thwarted the opening of SaveAll stores in other towns. So what? Maybe if we knew that the bankruptcy rates were LOWER in those towns, then we would have information relevant to the argument.\n\nBut simply knowing the answer to (A) doesn't help us evaluate the author's logic. Regardless of the answer, the author would still be concerned about the evidence from the towns in which a SaveAll DID open. (A) is irrelevant and can be eliminated.\n\nWe don't care whether residents do all, most, some, or very little of their shopping at stores in Morganville. Whatever the percentage, we would simply want to know whether that percentage will CHANGE if a SaveAll is opened.\n\nKnowing whether the percentage will increase or decrease in Morganville's shopping district would certainly be useful, but simply knowing the current percentage would not help us evaluate the argument. Eliminate (B).\n\nLet's say we find out that roughly a quarter of stores in a HEALTHY central shopping district suffer bankruptcy during a typical five-year period. This would be evidence that losing a quarter of the stores to bankruptcy is NOT a sign that a shopping district is \"unhealthy\". In that case, the records from the other towns would simply show that, DESPITE having a SaveAll, the shopping districts maintained  bankruptcy rates.\n\nSo, the fact that a quarter of stores in Morganville's central shopping district will likely experience bankruptcy is no cause for alarm. This is what we would expect in ANY healthy central shopping district. So, based on the evidence, there is no reason to expect that opening a SaveAll will negatively affect the health of the central shopping district.\n\nAnswering this question would certainly be useful in evaluating the argument, so hang on to (C).\n\nWe don't care about the staff at the SaveAll. The argument is not related to employment/unemployment stats. Maybe most of the employees are from Morganville and maybe not. Either way, will opening a SaveAll cause an unhealthy level of bankruptcies? (D) does not help us evaluate the argument, so eliminate this one.\n\nMaybe they do and maybe they don't. In either case, the SaveAll stores could negatively affect business in the central shopping districts and cause bankruptcies within five years. (E) is irrelevant and can be eliminated.\n\n(C) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "Meat from chickens contaminated with salmonella bacteria can cause serious food poisoning. Capsaicin, the chemical that gives chili peppers their hot flavor, has antibacterial properties. Chickens do not have taste receptors for capsaicin and will readily eat feed laced with capsaicin. When chickens were fed such feed and then exposed to salmonella bacteria, relatively few of them became contaminated with salmonella.\n\nIn deciding whether the feed would be useful in raising salmonella-free chicken for retail sale, it would be most helpful to determine which of the following?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The passage itself doesn't have a conclusion, but we are trying to select an answer choice that would  whether the capsaicin-laced feed would be useful in raising salmonella-free chicken for retail sale. So we need to select an answer choice that represents information that would help us make that determination. Before we do that, make sure you read the passage carefully and pay close attention to the author's word choice:\n\n cause serious food poisoning.\" - The meat from contaminated chickens CAN cause serious food poisoning, but it doesn't ALWAYS cause serious food poisoning.We are trying to decide whether feeding capsaicin to chickens would help us raise salmonella-free chicken . What if meat from chickens that consume capsaicin tastes awful (or just very different than normal chicken meat)? Sure, the meat would be salmonella-free, but if it tastes weird, consumers might not purchase the chicken. In that case, feeding capsaicin to chickens would not be a useful solution for raising chickens for retail sale. But if the chicken meat tastes the same with or without the capsaicin, then this could be an effective solution. Determining whether feeding capsaicin to chickens affects the taste of their meat would be useful in making the decision, so keep (A).\n\nWe are trying to decide whether capsaicin-laced feed would be useful in raising salmonella-free chickens for retail sale. In making that decision, we don't care whether capsaicin can be consumed by  to reduce the risk of salmonella. Eliminate (B).\n\nWe are not trying to compare chicken meat to other kinds of meat. We are simply trying to determine whether capsaicin-laced feed would help raise salmonella-free chickens. Determining whether chicken is more prone to salmonella contamination than other kinds of meat would NOT help, so eliminate (C).\n\nEven if appropriate cooking could prevent food poisoning, that wouldn't help us determine whether capsaicin can help us SELL salmonella-free chickens. True, choice (D) might make this question irrelevant, but you have to stick to what's being asked. We need information that would help us decide whether the capsaicin-laced feed would be useful in RAISING salmonella-free chicken for retail sale, and (D) doesn't help.\n\nWe don't care where the capsaicin comes from. All that matters is whether capsaicin-laced feed is an effective solution for raising salmonella-free chickens for retail sale. Choice (E) is irrelevant and can be eliminated.\n\n(A) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

Each year since then, about thirty journalists have been imprisoned for printing articles that criticize the government. In 1994, under the old government, only six journalists were imprisoned for criticizing the government. So the old government was more tolerant of criticism by the press than the new one is.\n\nPolitician: But in 1994 only six journalists criticized the government, and now journalists routinely do.\n\nThe politician challenges the journalist’s argument by doing which of the following?\n",
        "answer": "Added the OA",
        "explanation": "Journalist's Conclusion: The old government was more tolerant of criticism by the press than the new one is.\n\nSupport for that Conclusion: Since new government, about thirty journalists per year have been imprisoned for criticizing the government. During the year 1994, under the old government, only six journalists were imprisoned for criticizing the government.\n\nAssumption: The reason for the increase in journalists imprisoned per year is a difference in tolerance.\n\nPolitician: But in 1994 only six journalists criticized the government, and now journalists routinely do.\n\nWhat the politician says indicates that the reason for the increase is not a difference in tolerance but rather an increase in the number of journalists who criticize the government.\n\n\n\nThis choice could be tempting, because the politician does mention a difference in numbers, but the difference that the politician mentions is the difference between the number of journalists who criticized the previous government the number who criticize the current government. The politician does not dispute the validity of the numbers that the journalist uses to support the conclusion and does not claim that they are not representative of what is occurring. The politician's point is that, even though those numbers are correct and even though those numbers accurately represent what has occurred, the journalist's conclusion is not valid.\n\n\n\nEven through what the politician says about journalists' routinely criticizing the current government could be taken as indicating that the 30 journalists imprisoned per year does not include all journalists who criticize the current government, the politician does not actually make the case that the journalist's argument is flawed because not all journalists who criticize the government are imprisoned, and the politician does not otherwise indicate that the journalist treats information about some journalists as if it applied to all journalists.\n\n\n\n(B) describes exactly how the politician challenges the argument. By indicating that criticism of the government by journalists has increased, the politician attacks the assumption that the reason for the increase in imprisonment of journalists is that the current government is less tolerant of criticism than the previous government was. The politician attacks that assumption by presenting an alternative cause, increase in criticism, for the observed effect, increase in number of journalist imprisoned.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "While proponents argue about the benefits of vaccination for children, there is hardly any concrete data to back up their claims. Not only is the efficacy of the vaccines questionable but  there are also possible chances that vaccines cause various illnesses such as autism. Children who have been vaccinated have a probability of 0.8% of getting the diseases that they have been vaccinated against while the national average of all the children who get the disease, including the children who have not been vaccinated, is 0.85%. So, there is hardly any improvement in the prevention rate because of vaccination.\n\nWhich of the following options would help the most to evaluate the given argument?\n",

Now the denominator includes both (Vaccinated + Non vaccinated children).

        "explanation": "Fame, \nSo, the hamsters have an inherited disease, and 24 hr/day of fluorescent light helps them more than 1/2 fluorescent light and 1/2 darkness.  Something about the light promotes healing more than the darkness.  Is fluorescent light better than sunlight?  We don't know, that's not addressed.  We are exploring some connection between light (either time of light or kind of light) and healing.  \n\n \nTotal distractor.  Nothing in the prompt is about comparing different kinds of light, or about perception instead of healing.  \n\n \nThe effect of light on healing --- this is a promising one.  \n\n \nAdmittedly, this is somewhat paradoxical, given this prompt.  This one, though, is not specifically about healing, about immune function.  Also, these fish have  to live in total darkness, so presumably their response to light would be quite different from that of an animal (such as a hamster or a human) that has evolved in ordinary circadian rhythms of light.  It's not clear whether the hamster study would \"shed any light\" on how these fish survive.  \n\n \nAnother great distractor.  This has nothing about light, which is clearly the central point of the prompt.  Other inherited disease that hamsters could get ---that sounds like a huge topic, and presumable some of them would have nothing to do with exposure to light.  It's not clear that the methods of research presented in this prompt would be helpful here.  \n\n \nThe prompt was looking at how light, and availability of light, promotes healing, that is to say, immune response.   This is about plants, not animals --- a huge different biologically.  This is about what might be helpful about darkness, not light.  This concerns, not the immune system in particular, but the ordinary life-cycle of a plant.  It's not well connected to the research about hamsters.  \nI will say, though, I think this is a flaw in the question.  Technically, the question says, \"\"  Well, apart from any context, any of the science concerning healing in hamsters, the bare-bones research method of 24hr light vs. (1/2 light, 1/2 dark) would probably be exactly what you would have to use to test the hypothesis about plants needing light to bloom.  I can see whoever wrote the question did not intend for this to be the answer, but whoever wrote the question did not do a particularly good job with diction, especially in that final prompt question.  Technically, \"method of research\" could be the specific design of this experiment, which would make  a credible answer.   \n\n is clearly the answer the question authored wanted, but because the prompt was not worded well,  is also a credible answer.  I have no idea what the source of this question is, but I would say --- this is a faulty CR question.  In a well-written question, you would not have a \"loophole\" answer such as this.  \n\nThat's my 2¢\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)",

Taken in larger-than-advised quantities, these diclofenac effluents could have serious health effects, but they are present in quantities far too low to cause any physiological response in people who drink the water or bathe in it. Nevertheless, medical experts contend that eliminating these trace amounts from the water will have public health benefits, since _________________.\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Not the best question in the world IMO - I think this is one where you have to go through by process of elimination.\n\nArgument: Eliminating trace amounts of diclofenac effluents from pharmaceutical laboratories will improve public health. Why?\n\nLet's look at the answers:\n\nA. Diclofenac effluents, even in large amounts, are harmless to humans. We can eliminate this, since it directly contradicts the argument. If even large amounts of whatever this thing is are harmless to humans, then eliminating them will not improve public health.\n\nB. Bacteria can become resistant to diclofenac effluents. Well, if these things are used in pharmaceuticals - meaning it's probably a material for medicine - then that's pretty bad. It means that disease-causing bacteria in the water will be resistant to medicine, and you can be exposed to these bacteria if you swim in the rivers and lakes. However, this may still be off topic and we may find a better answer. We don't eliminate it and keep going.\n\nC. The side effects of medicines have not been fully explored - we can eliminate this, since this doesn't mention anything about whether diclofenac effluent is good or bad. If it's not fully explored, we can't justify saying whether it is good or bad for us.\n\nD. Again, an answer that goes against our argument. If it breaks down into harmless substance, there's no logic for why we need to remove it.\n\nE. Some of the effluent can counteract possible harmful effects of other such medical pollutants found there. This is the trap answer - there's too much generality for it to be considered. The fact that it says \"possible\" harmful effects means we cannot determine for sure that removing the effluents will help public health, which is what the argument states. If this answer said \"diclofenac effluents counteract harmful effects from other medical pollutants\", I think I would've picked this answer.\n\nGoing through the answers, only B and E possibly make sense. B is the better answer - it is more specific, definitely states something harmful to human health that can be prevented (disease-causing bacteria vs. POSSIBLE harmful effects), and is my answer.",

The first sentence doesn't really help but the key to this question is the last sentence.  There's a distinction and comparison between siblings of classical migraine sufferers and spouse of classical migraine sufferers.  Author posits that siblings of classical migraine sufferers are four times more likely than general population to experience classical migraine.  On the other hand, spouse of classical migraine sufferers are no more likely than general population to experience classical migraine.  If you understand this then it should be clear why A is correct.  A is synonymous to the last sentence of the passage, the author just puts it in a different or perhaps more convoluted way to catch the test takers.\n\n\nWhy D is incorrect?  The prompt only talks about siblings (brother &amp; sister) and spouses (husband/wives) of the migraine sufferers.

        "question": "Cheever College offers several online courses via remote computer connection, in addition to traditional classroom-based courses. A study of student performance at Cheever found that, overall, the average student grade for online courses matched that for classroom-based courses. In this calculation of the average grade, course withdrawals were weighted as equivalent to a course failure, and the rate of withdrawal was much lower for students enrolled in classroom-based courses than for students enrolled in online courses.\n\nIf the statements above are true, which of the following must also be true of Cheever College?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Here we have another inference question, so we don't have a conclusion with a well-structured line of reasoning. As always, make sure that you clearly understand the given information and pay attention to the details:\n\n online courses (OCs) via remote computer connection. factoring in the students who did NOT withdraw, we are starting with a higher proportion of failure among the OC students. For example, if there were twice as many withdrawals from OCs as there were from CBCs, then we'd be starting with a failure rate that is twice as high among OC students as it is for CBC students (again, BEFORE factoring in the students who did not withdraw).\n\nNow let's factor in the students who did NOT withdraw. Let's say that the average grade among OC students who did not withdraw was the SAME as the average grade among CBC students who did not withdraw. As stated above, there were more OC withdrawals. So if the  averages are equal and there are  OC withdrawals, then the  average of OC students would have to be  than the  average of CBC students.\n\nBut we are told that this is  the case and that the overall averages are the same for both groups. Remember, when we are just looking at the withdrawals, we are starting with a higher failure proportion among OC students. In order for the average of the OC students to \"catch-up\" to the average of the CBC students, the average of the OC students who did NOT withdraw would have to be HIGHER than the average of the CBC students who did not withdraw. Otherwise, the CBC students would have a higher overall average.\n\nAs described in the preceding analysis, choice (A) has to be true. Keep this one.\n\nThe study is concerned with AVERAGE grades, so we cannot determine anything about the actual  of students per course. Eliminate (B).\n\nThe study compares average student grade for OCs to average student grade for CBCs. This study could be conducted even if some students took both types of courses. The study would simply include the student's OC grades in the OC average and include the student's CBC grades in the CBC average. So we might have students who took both types and we might not. (C) cannot be determined.\n\nAs with choice (B), the findings involve AVERAGE grades. It is certainly possible that a large portion of the students with the BEST grades took CBCs. As long as the AVERAGE of OC students who did not withdraw was higher than the AVERAGE of the CBC students who did not withdraw, it doesn't matter which group has the students with the BEST grades. For example, it is possible that the 10  students all took CBCs, the rest of the CBC students did poorly, and most of the OC students did fairly well.\n\nChoice (D)  be true, but we don't know for sure. And we certainly cannot determine that a  majority of the students with the best grades took OCs rather than CBCs. Eliminate (D).\n\nThe information in the passage does not offer any evidence to EXPLAIN the data. All we can determine is that the average of the OC students who did NOT withdraw has to be higher than the average of the CBC students who did not withdraw. A number of factors could explain this result (better teachers, better courses, etc). Choice (E) is a  explanation, but we cannot determine whether it is true based on the information in the passage. Eliminate (E).\n\nChoice (A) is the only statement that HAS to be true.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

Unbiased experts agree that this lack of representation is  to the fact that Women's Rights initiatives fail to receive necessary governmental financing.\n\nWhich of the following conclusions is best supported by the information above?\n\nThe words 'directly linked' are strong in that they suggest that further what may come would more likely elaborate the notion that lesser number of women in the committee is the reason for lesser funding for women rights initiative. \n\nA. The government in Country X attempts to limit the funding given to Women's Rights initiatives by restricting the number of their representatives in the budget committees. - INCORRECT. The option attempts to establish a Causal relationship which can't be proven. Is it because of government limits that they do by not allowing more women in the committee or the other way round or because of some other reason? Without further details in the passage it is difficult to make this option a right one.\n\nB. Women's Rights Organizations need to raise additional funding in order to secure more seats for their representatives in the committees. - INCORRECT. Again based on the similar grounds of causality this option fails to ring bells correctly.\n\nC. The current representatives of the Women's Rights Organizations are to blame for the failure to receive sufficient government funding. - INCORRECT. May be true but without more information supporting this claim in the passage it would be difficult to say that.\n\nD. Women's Rights initiatives would receive more governmental funding if the budget committees included more Women's Rights Representatives. - CORRECT. What if WRI doesn't receive more funding if more women are included? If true, then intermediate conclusion that 'this lack of representation is directly linked to the fact that Women's Rights initiatives fail to receive necessary governmental financing' falls apart. Hence this conclusion should complete the passage in the right direction.\n\nE.

The first sentence says that maintaining a functioning infrastructure is  to maintaining a high standard of living.

(So if you don’t raise your standard of living, you didn’t do major investment in your infrastructure.) The conclusion says if your standard of living is on the rise, then you have invested heavily in infrastructure. But heavy investment was only one way to raise your standard of living.

This is our answer, because the argument assumes that major investment is the  way to make your standard of living rise, which confused a sufficient with a necessary condition.\n\nE) Short-term crises are irrelevant.\n\nThe best answer is D.

So, the sum of 250 may include athletes that have been counted twice or three times. This is the possibility that has not been considered. Thus,  \n\nA is incorrect. The athletic director has specifically ruled this out as a possibility. C is not the correct answer choice. This possibility is reflected adequately in the different numbers of athletes active in each sport. No oversight seems likely here. D is incorrect.

        "question": "Industrialist: Environmentalists contend that emissions from our factory pose a health risk to those living downwind. The only testimony presented in support of this contention comes from residents of the communities surrounding the factory. But only a trained scientist can determine whether or not these emissions are dangerous, and none of the residents are scientists. Hence our factory’s emissions present no health risk.\n\nThe reasoning in the industrialist’s argument is flawed because the argument\n\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "OK, I’m actually starting to get sick of this flaw because I’ve seen it so many times. Defeating an argument does not prove the opposite of that argument’s conclusion! Imagine: “Nathan is an atheist who believes there is no God. But Nathan can provide no evidence that there is no God. Therefore Nathan’s argument cannot stand. And therefore, God certainly does exist.” No, jackass, that’s not a good argument. Just because I can’t prove there isn’t a God doesn’t somehow prove that God does exist.\n\nThat’s exactly what this argument does.\n\nHere’s another, similarly-flawed, argument: “The defendant claims that he was injured on the night of the murder, and therefore not strong enough to have raised the sledgehammer over the victim’s head while she was sleeping. But we have video footage of him at the county fair that night, winning a giant teddy bear on the ‘test your strength’ game. Therefore, even though we didn’t present any evidence that the defendant had motive, or was at the scene of the crime, or had fingerprints on the sledgehammer, or is actually connected in any way to the victim, we have conclusively proven (based solely on the fact that we have disproven one facet of his defense) that the defendant is the murderer.” Uh, no you haven’t. Stop it.\n\nA) No, the argument doesn’t do this. The argument doesn’t say, “We shouldn’t listen to the residents because they are biased.” Instead, the argument says, “Only scientists are qualified,” which is a substantive reason to eliminate the testimony of the residents, rather than naked discrimination.\n\nB) No, this is just irrelevant.\n\nC) Well, yeah. If scientists are the only ones that know whether or not the emissions are safe, you’ll need to provide testimony from those scientists in order to claim that the emissions are safe. It’s definitely not enough to go, “Only scientists know for sure, so we can’t listen to the residents, and even though the scientists didn’t testify at all, we have therefore proven that the emissions are safe.” That ain’t how it works. So this is a good answer.\n\nD) No, the net value of the factory isn’t at issue here. The only thing at issue is whether the emissions are safe or unsafe.\n\nE) This would be the answer if the argument had unfairly used the term “health risk” in two different ways. I don’t see that happening here. I thought our answer would more clearly say, “Disproof of an argument doesn’t prove the opposite of the argument’s conclusion.” But C, even though it doesn’t say exactly that, does point out that the industrialist hasn’t presented his own argument, and has instead tried to rely solely on defeating his opponent’s argument to prove his own conclusion.\n\nSo our answer is C.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

However, if the information in answer choice (C) is true, the services that some companies provide  be made available -- even if it is not possible for the company providing those services to be profitable. Under the proposed plan, unprofitable public-sector companies would be sold to the private sector and would be shut down if they cannot be made profitable.

Flavius cut funding for the arts, so it’s not a shocker that he was criticized in many plays, which are, after all, part of the arts. It would be foolish to assume, on these facts, that Flavius was “widely unpopular among his subjects,” unless of course his subjects were all artists, which is not in evidence here.\n\nWe’re asked to find a flaw in the logic. One way of stating it would be “makes a broader conclusion than is warranted by the facts.”\n\nA) Not what I’m looking for.\n\nB) Yes, exactly. Playwrights might have hated Flavius for cutting their paychecks, so the opinion of playwrights isn’t a “reliable indicator” of his popularity among his subjects more broadly. Great answer.\n\nC) No, the argument doesn’t do this. The argument provides evidence that Flavius “believed deeply in manual labor and temperance,” and more evidence that Flavius “removed financial support” for the arts. Those two things are pretty solid evidence that Flavius hated the arts.\n\nD) The argument doesn’t make any conclusions whatsoever about the impact Flavius had on the arts. Maybe he succeeded, maybe he didn’t—we just don’t know.\n\nE) This is simply irrelevant to the question of whether the plays are good evidence of Flavius’ popularity.\n\nOur answer is B, because it shows why the argument is bullshit.­­\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

After all, the fact that there haven't been any responses doesn't mean that there \"must\" not be any intelligence there. After all, there could be intelligence that has not bothered to respond.\n\nSo, since the fact that the argument makes that leap is a weakness in the argument, this choice captures a way in which the argument is questionable, or flawed.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nIt's true that the argument doesn't consider the possibility that there is extraterrestrial intelligence beyond our neighboring star systems.\n\nHowever, it's not the case that the argunent \"assigns too little importance\" to that possibility. After all, the argument is about our neighboring star systems only. So, in the context of the argument, that possibility is irrelevant. So, the argument works without assigning any importance to that possibility.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nIt's true that the argument does not mention that some governments have sent meticulously prepared messages and recordings on spacecraft.\n\nAt the same time, failure to mention that information is not a flaw in the argument, for two reasons.\n\nOne reason is that, regardless of whether governments have sent such messages and recordings, it remains the case that information has been sent out, and no response has been received. In other words, the fact that messages not mentioned in the argument have been sent doesn't materially change what we know.\n\nThe second is that messages sent by spacecraft would not yet have reached neighboring star systems. So, the fact that such messages have been sent is irrelevant in the context of this argument, which is about information that has reached neighboring star systems.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nEven if it is probable that most star systems are uninhabited, that information goes along with the conclusion that there is no intelligence in neighoring star systems.\n\nSo, the argument does not have to address that probability to work since it works regardless of whether that probability exists.\n\nEliminate.\n\n B",

        "explanation": "Source of Question: Manhattan Review (LSAT)\n\nOfficial Explanation\n\nArgument construction\n\nThe parliamentarian states that no crime that impacts only a few victims (for example, murdering only one or two people) deserves capital punishment. Therefore, on the basis of this statement, he concludes that the capital punishment can be awarded only for the rarest of rare crimes that threaten the survival or well-being of the society as a whole.\n\nSome people object to this conclusion and give as counterexamples such cases in which only one or two people may have been killed but which were so brutal or gruesome as to make the general population think that the murderer deserved to get capital punishment.\n\nTo this objection, the parliamentarian responds that if those cases really deserve capital punishment, then they must have hurt more than a few individual victims.\n\nFlaw in the argument\n\nLet's dissect the argument.\n\nThe parliament' principle:\n\nThe parliamentarian decides the applicability of capital punishment for a crime by looking at the number of victims impacted by the crime.\n\nIf a crime impacts only a few individual victims, then capital punishment should not be awarded.\n\nThe Parliamentarian's Conclusion/Assertion\n\nCapital punishment should be awarded if and only if a crime impacts the survival or well-being of the whole society.\n\nHow does he support this conclusion? Simply by citing his above principle.\n\nPeople's counterexample:\n\nGruesome crimes that impact only one or two individual victims but are generally considered to deserve capital punishment.\n\nThe parliamentarian's defense:\n\nThe counterexample doesn't ruffle the parliamentarian at all. Rather, he still uses his principle to respond to it.\n\nHe says that if the gruesome crimes that are offered as a counterexample deserve capital punishment, then they cannot have impacted only a few individuals. (Perhaps he would go down the road of showing how the families or neighborhoods of the victims were impacted too, or how those crimes destabilized the society as a whole and therefore merited capital punishment to preserve the well-being of the society etc.)\n\nWhat is the flaw in the parliamentarian's reasoning?\n\nHe makes a conclusion based on nothing but his self-proclaimed stance treated as the absolute and incontrovertible truth. When that conclusion is challenged by counterexamples, he again responds by citing his stance, and suggests that if those counterexamples are true, then they must adhere to his stance.\n\nLet's analyze each option one by one.\n\nAnswer choices explanation:\n\nA: This is incorrect. While the parliamentarian does blindly accept his stance to be true (\"unfounded acceptance\"), the argument does not suggest that this stance is popular and is the generally held opinion of most people.\nB: This is incorrect. There is nothing in the argument that suggests that the parliamentarian exercised his authority/power to enforce his opinion.\nC: This is incorrect. There is nothing in the argument that suggests that the parliamentarian appealed emotionally to sell his opinion.\nD: This is incorrect. The counter-argument advanced by the parliamentarian (in response to the counterexamples) is relevant to the argument.\nE: This is correct. It is in line with the analysis done above. The parliamentarian's conclusion is rather a rephrase of his opinion.",

        "question": "Sasha: It must be healthy to follow a diet high in animal proteins and fats. Human beings undoubtedly evolved to thrive on such a diet, since our prehistoric ancestors ate large amounts of meat.\n\nJamal: But our ancestors also exerted themselves intensely in order to obtain this food, whereas most human beings today are much less physically active.\n\nJamal responds to Sasha by doing which of the following?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "- Sasha makes a claim (“must be healthy” clearly indicates a claim) that following a diet high in animal proteins and fats must be healthy.\n\n - This portion supports the claim made in the first statement (The way to read any passage is to connect every idea back to the previous ones. At every statement, you should ask yourself, “How is this connected with the context so far?”)\n\n - This portion supports the idea mentioned in the initial part of the sentence. Since our prehistoric ancestors ate a lot of meat, Sasha claims, human beings evolved to thrive on such a diet. (Since human beings evolved to thrive on a diet of meat, a diet high in animal proteins and fats must be healthy.)\n\n - Jamal starts his statement with a ‘but’ that indicates he is going to oppose some aspect of Sasha’s statement. Jamal points out a difference between human beings today and our ancestors – the level of physical exertion. (How does that impact Sasha’s point? Sasha’s argument was that what worked for our ancestors should work for us. By pointing out a difference between our ancestors and us, Jamal indicates that what worked for them may not work for us).\n\nThe one glaring gap in Sasha’s argument that can be exploited in multiple ways is that she assumed that what worked for our ancestors would work for us. What if there are differences between us and our ancestors such that what worked for them may not work for us? (Jamal indicates just this.)\n\nAnother gap in Sasha’s argument is that she assumes that just because our ancestors ate that diet, it was healthy for them. It is entirely possible that our ancestors ate a lot of meat probably because they didn’t have an option, not because it was healthy for them. If meat was not even healthy for our ancestors, Sasha’s argument would be junk.\n\nWe have to find an option that tells us the way in which Jamal responds to Sasha. We have already discussed that Jamal points out a difference between us and our ancestors and thereby suggests that Sasha’s line of reasoning is not entirely correct.\n\n\n\n So, if you say that “XYZ is the best country”, qualifying your statement would mean adding exceptions or restrictions to this statement. A few examples of qualifying this statement would be:  “XYZ is the best in terms of educational standards”, “XYZ is the best if we do not include Switzerland and Poland in our consideration”, or “XYZ is the best except in October and November”.\n\nNow coming back to the option, is Jamal bringing some information that suggests that Sasha should add reservations to or exceptions to her main conclusion that it must be healthy to follow a diet high in animal proteins and fats? The answer is yes. Sasha should add a reservation by stating something like: following a diet high in animal proteins and fats must be healthy, except probably for people who work much less than our ancestors.\n\n\n\n\nWe regularly come across people who have trouble with questions, like this one, that are based on conversation. The primary difference between these conversation based questions and regular argument questions is that a regular argument generally has a unidirectional flow (a conclusion supported by some premises). On the other hand, these conversation based questions typically involve one person making the argument and then another person challenging that argument. Thus, reasoning exists both in favor and against a certain point. The challenge therefore becomes two-fold: to understand how the conclusion is supported and to understand how the conclusion (and its reasoning) is challenged.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

Hence they will not place undue trust in the advice given by this actor. Therefore, networks should relax their guidelines to permit our company to broadcast this advertisement.\n\n: If the audience can tell that the actor is not a physician, then your advertisement need not have a physician figure recommending your product.\n\nWhich of the following is an argumentative strategy used by the television executive in response to the drug manufacturer?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dear ,\n\nI'm happy to help with this.  \n\nThis gets at the very heart of the contradiction that the TV exec is pointing out.  Presumably, the drug manufacturer wants a \"doctor\" in the ad to give credibility to his recommendation.  But if, as the drug manufacturer suggests, most of the audience will realize it's not a doctor, then of course what that actor/doctor says loses most of its credibility.   That's the big contradiction that the TV exec points outs.  This is why (A) is correct.  \n\n  \n\nIt's true that the drug manufacturer makes a sweeping generalization about the audience, but the TV exec doesn't argue against that in the least.  The TV exec simply accepts that at face value, saying, \"If 's true, then ...\"  The TV exec doesn't call that sweeping generalization into question at all --- rather, he says \"Let's assume that sweeping generalization is true.  Then, wouldn't such-and-such be true?\"  Rather than calling the sweeping generalization into question, the TV exec turns it around and makes his part and parcel of his counter-argument.  This is why (E) is incorrect.  \n\nBTW, I don't know the source, but I don't really like this as a GMAT CR question.  Among other things, all the CR questions in the GMAT , in addition to having a firm logical basis, are also grounded in what actually takes place in the real world.  By contrast, the conversation of this CR question has to be taking place in some imaginary fantasy world.  In our real world, having actors play doctors and thereby bamboozle the general public is absolutely standard practice throughout drug advertising --- it's not even the least bit controversial.  The practice is essentially universal, and has never been challenged legally in any serious way.  The only reason a TV executive would possible object would be moral --- I would argue that the TV executive who turns down a lucrative advertising contract for purely moral reasons is an entity slightly more fictional than Tinkerbell and the Tooth Fairy.  \n\nDoes all this make sense?\n\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)",

It asks you to find the answer that describes how the argument “proceeds,” that is, how it comes to its conclusion.\n\n\nBased on the experience of “a number” of amateur photographers with a particular camera, the argument urges “any” ( = all) such photographers to\nchoose that camera. \n\n\nThe correct answer will describe how the argument applied the assertions of a small group (the amateur photographers with the Apheron camera) to make\na suggestion to a larger group (all amateur photographers). \n\n\nAnswer A talks about testing conditions, while the argument makes no mention of testing conditions, so it is off the mark. Answer B says that the argument uses a subset to make a recommendation for a larger group, and this meets your criteria. The amateur photographers are the subset and the “any” photographers are your larger group. With answer C the credibility of the amateur photographers is accepted as a given and is not part of the argument. For answer D, the motivations for buying the camera are never discussed in the argument. The experience of the smaller group of photographers is not given any wider context. It is only used to recommend the camera to a larger group, so answer E is incorrect.

Having those etchings will increase attendance to the exhibition and hence increase revenue from our general admission fee.\n\nMuseum Administrator: But Venus is our biggest attraction. Moreover the Hart’s show will run for twice as long as our exhibition. So on balance the number of patrons may decrease.\n\nThe point of the administrator’s response to the curator is to question\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Situation A curator and a museum administrator debate whether lending a particular artwork to the Hart Institute in exchange for a loan of some of the Hart Institute's artworks would increase or decrease attendance and revenue at the museum.\n\nReasoning Which of the curator's explicit or implicit claims is the museum administrator questioning? The administrator's statements that Venus is the museum's biggest attraction and that the Hart Institute's show will run twice as long as the museum's exhibition do not directly conflict with any statement or assumption made by the curator. However, the administrator's conclusion is that on balance the number of patrons at the museum may decrease if the curator's proposal is followed. This conclusion calls into question the curator's claim that the proposal will increase revenue from the general admission fee, since that claim presupposes that on balance the proposal will increase the number of visitors to the museum. (The context suggests that the administrator is using the term patrons to mean visitors rather than donors.)\n\n The curator implicitly infers that the former number will be larger than the latter, whereas the administrator questions this by asserting that the latter number may be larger than the former.\n\nWhy are other options wrong? :-\n\nA - The administrator does not dispute that the Rembrandt etchings would probably increase attendance at the print exhibition but rather suggests that this increase would be exceeded by the loss of visitors to the museum while the Hart Institute borrows Venus.\n\nB - Neither the curator nor the administrator comments on whether the patrons attracted to the Rembrandt etchings would be the same people attracted to Venus.\n\nD - The administrator does not question whether the revenue during the print exhibition will exceed the revenue during the Hart Institute's exhibition, but rather whether it will exceed the loss of revenue during the Hart Institute's exhibition.\n\nE - Neither the curator nor the administrator comments on whether the museum would gain more or less from the exchange than the Hart Institute would.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t | \n\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n\n |  |  |  |  |  |",

Therefore, on the basis of this statement, he concludes that the capital punishment can be awarded only for the rarest of rare crimes that threaten the survival or well-being of the society as a whole.\n\nSome people object to this conclusion and give as counterexamples such cases in which only one or two people may have been killed but which were so brutal or gruesome as to make the general population think that the murderer deserved to get capital punishment.\n\nTo this objection, the parliamentarian responds that if those cases really deserve capital punishment, then they must have hurt more than a few individual victims.\n\nFlaw in the argument\n\nLet's dissect the argument.\n\nThe parliament' principle:\n\nThe parliamentarian decides the applicability of capital punishment for a crime by looking at the number of victims impacted by the crime.\n\nIf a crime impacts only a few individual victims, then capital punishment should not be awarded.\n\nThe Parliamentarian's Conclusion/Assertion\n\nCapital punishment should be awarded if and only if a crime impacts the survival or well-being of the whole society.\n\nHow does he support this conclusion? Simply by citing his above principle.\n\nPeople's counterexample:\n\nGruesome crimes that impact only one or two individual victims but are generally considered to deserve capital punishment.\n\nThe parliamentarian's defense:\n\nThe counterexample doesn't ruffle the parliamentarian at all. Rather, he still uses his principle to respond to it.\n\nHe says that if the gruesome crimes that are offered as a counterexample deserve capital punishment, then they cannot have impacted only a few individuals. (Perhaps he would go down the road of showing how the families or neighborhoods of the victims were impacted too, or how those crimes destabilized the society as a whole and therefore merited capital punishment to preserve the well-being of the society etc.)\n\nWhat is the flaw in the parliamentarian's reasoning?\n\nHe makes a conclusion based on nothing but his self-proclaimed stance treated as the absolute and incontrovertible truth. When that conclusion is challenged by counterexamples, he again responds by citing his stance, and suggests that if those counterexamples are true, then they must adhere to his stance.\n\nLet's analyze each option one by one.\n\nAnswer choices explanation:\n\nA: This is incorrect. While the parliamentarian does blindly accept his stance to be true (\"unfounded acceptance\"), the argument does not suggest that this stance is popular and is the generally held opinion of most people.\nB: This is incorrect. There is nothing in the argument that suggests that the parliamentarian exercised his authority/power to enforce his opinion.\nC: This is incorrect. There is nothing in the argument that suggests that the parliamentarian appealed emotionally to sell his opinion.\nD: This is incorrect. The counter-argument advanced by the parliamentarian (in response to the counterexamples) is relevant to the argument.\nE: This is correct. It is in line with the analysis done above. The parliamentarian's conclusion is rather a rephrase of his opinion.",

        "question": "Angelica: The cultural development of the Roaring Twenties is a direct result of the social breakdown that occurred during World War I. The soldiers and other young people witnessed the dishonesty of authority figures regarding the war, its causes, and the nature of patriotism, and the Roaring Twenties became a backlash against authority, with the defiance of traditions and moral expectations. This became the tone of the Modern Age, so the Roaring Twenties may be called the start of modernism.\n\nLuca: While the 1920s generation embraced the mood of modernism more thoroughly than previous generations, it is more correct to note that the Modern Age had already begun in the mid-nineteenth century, as philosophers and political thinkers started questioning traditional religious authorities and raising questions about the nature of morality.\n\nLuca responds to Angelica’s comment by doing which of the following?\n\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Question presents a conversation between Angelica and Luca, in which they are discussing the history of the “Roaring Twenties” and its connection to the advent of modernism. Angelica claims that the Roaring Twenties occurred as “direct result of the social breakdown that occurred during World War I.” The war left such strongly negative impressions that young people rejected the authority of their elders and the traditions that they represented. This, claims Angelica, was the start of modernism. Luca counters by arguing that the Roaring Twenties definitely suggests a more universal willingness to embrace modernism but that the Modern Age itself “had already begun in the mid-nineteenth century” with the philosophers and political scientists who were questioning authority and traditions long before World War I began. The question asks the student to identify the way that Luca responds to Angelica’s argument. The student should recognize immediately that there is no polarization in Luca’s answer: he does not outright agree or disagree with Angelica. Instead he agrees, but with conditions, the primary condition being the way that Angelica describes the origin of modernism. The correct answer choice will reflect this.\n\n\n\nA Answer choice (A) accurately notes that Luca acknowledges Angelica’s point in part but suggests that she revise her starting point for modernism. Answer choice (A) is correct.\n\n\n\nB Luca does not necessarily criticize the substance of Angelica’s argument. He agrees, in fact, that the Roaring Twenties does represent a rejection of authority and traditions. He disagrees, however, that this was unique to the post-war experience and indicates that it had begun previously. Answer choice (B) cannot be correct.\n\nC At no point does Luca mention or criticize a logical fallacy that is embedded in Angelica’s argument, so answer choice (C) should be eliminated immediately.\n\nD Far from questioning the possibility of arriving at a conclusion, Luca merely disagrees with a part of Angelica’s argument and seems to indicate that they could agree. Answer choice (D) cannot be correct.\n\nE Luca does provide some alternate views, but his response is not necessarily a point-by-point disagreement. Instead, he offers a more general summary of why he disagrees.

As always, pay close attention to the author's word choice:\n\n prevent automobile collisions.\" - Such laws  prevent automobile collisions, but they might not. effective in preventing collisions in those countries.\"As described above, just because the continental US does not have such laws does NOT mean that headlights would not help. Perhaps drivers in the continental US who use their headlights are slightly LESS likely to become involved in a collision. The information in the passage does not strongly suggest whether (A) is true, so eliminate this one.\n\nWe are not given information to compare the effect of poor daylight visibility to other factors that lead to automobile collisions. Daylight visibility might be a relatively minor factor or it might be a major factor. We don't know either way, so eliminate (B).\n\nWe know that headlight laws CAN prevent collisions, but this does not allow us to compare collision rates in the US to collision rates in countries that have such laws. For example, perhaps Canada has headlight laws but still has a higher proportion of collisions than the US. Without headlight laws, Canada would probably have an even HIGHER proportion of collisions. In other words, headlight laws might reduce the rate of collision in Canada, but we don't know how that reduced rate compares to the rate in the US. Eliminate (C).\n\nAgain, headlight laws can REDUCE the risk of collisions, but we don't have enough information to compare the number of collisions in the continental US to the number of collisions in countries with daytime headlight laws. For reasons similar to those discussed for option (C), choice (D) should be eliminated.\n\nWe know that the laws are MORE effective the farther away you move from the equator. Since the only countries that currently have such laws are farther from the equator than the continental US, we can infer that the laws would be more effective in those countries than in the continental US.\n\nChoice (E) can be properly inferred and is the best conclusion based on the information in the passage.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

Moreover, even if a person gets the permission to use copyright material, it may still account for plagiarism if the person tries to falsely claim the authorship of the material.\n\nWhich of the following must be true on the basis of the information given in the above argument?\n\n",

        "explanation": "The correct answer is C. This means that even if material is not protected under copyright, it can still be considered plagiarism if it is used without giving proper credit to the original source. \n\nOption A is incorrect because copyright infringement and plagiarism are two distinct concepts, and just because one occurs does not necessarily mean that the other has also occurred. \n\nOption B is also incorrect because plagiarism is concerned with false claims of authorship, while copyright infringement is about unauthorized use of protected material. \n\nOption D is incorrect because authorized use of copyright material with proper attribution does not constitute plagiarism. \n\nOption E is not necessarily true, as the difficulty in proving a case of infringement or plagiarism depends on the specific circumstances of the case.",

In 1993 they produced more umbrella stands than in 1983, but the increase in the number of ashtrays they produced was even greater over the same ten year period.\n\nIf all the facts above are true, which of the following must also be true?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Umbrella .......... 60 ....................... 70 (+10 from before)\n\nAlready note that say 60 increases by 10 so that is an increase of 16%.\nNow 40 must increase by more than 10 so by more than 25%. This %age increase will be higher because 40 is less than 60. When you increase 40 by the same amount as you increase 60, the percentage increase to 40 will be more. When you increase 40 by a higher amount than 60, the percentage increase in 40 will be even more!\n\nWhich must be true? (Refer to the data taken above)\n\nA. In 1993, the percentage of Consolidated Metal's production devoted to ashtrays was greater than that in 1983.\n\nSay 40 and 60 are both increased by the same amount 10. In 1993, production of ashtrays of the total will be 50/120 = 42% (higher than before). So if ashtrays are actually increased by a greater amount (more than 10), they will account for an even higher percentage of the total. \nHence, this will be true in all cases. When a smaller number is increased by a greater amount, it will take a larger share. \n\nB. In 1993, Consolidated Metals produced fewer ashtrays than umbrella stands.\n\nWe don't know.

        "question": "Cheever College offers several online courses via remote computer connection, in addition to traditional classroom-based courses. A study of student performance at Cheever found that, overall, the average student grade for online courses matched that for classroom-based courses. In this calculation of the average grade, course withdrawals were weighted as equivalent to a course failure, and the rate of withdrawal was much lower for students enrolled in classroom-based courses than for students enrolled in online courses.\n\nIf the statements above are true, which of the following must also be true of Cheever College?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Here we have another inference question, so we don't have a conclusion with a well-structured line of reasoning. As always, make sure that you clearly understand the given information and pay attention to the details:\n\n online courses (OCs) via remote computer connection. factoring in the students who did NOT withdraw, we are starting with a higher proportion of failure among the OC students. For example, if there were twice as many withdrawals from OCs as there were from CBCs, then we'd be starting with a failure rate that is twice as high among OC students as it is for CBC students (again, BEFORE factoring in the students who did not withdraw).\n\nNow let's factor in the students who did NOT withdraw. Let's say that the average grade among OC students who did not withdraw was the SAME as the average grade among CBC students who did not withdraw. As stated above, there were more OC withdrawals. So if the  averages are equal and there are  OC withdrawals, then the  average of OC students would have to be  than the  average of CBC students.\n\nBut we are told that this is  the case and that the overall averages are the same for both groups. Remember, when we are just looking at the withdrawals, we are starting with a higher failure proportion among OC students. In order for the average of the OC students to \"catch-up\" to the average of the CBC students, the average of the OC students who did NOT withdraw would have to be HIGHER than the average of the CBC students who did not withdraw. Otherwise, the CBC students would have a higher overall average.\n\nAs described in the preceding analysis, choice (A) has to be true. Keep this one.\n\nThe study is concerned with AVERAGE grades, so we cannot determine anything about the actual  of students per course. Eliminate (B).\n\nThe study compares average student grade for OCs to average student grade for CBCs. This study could be conducted even if some students took both types of courses. The study would simply include the student's OC grades in the OC average and include the student's CBC grades in the CBC average. So we might have students who took both types and we might not. (C) cannot be determined.\n\nAs with choice (B), the findings involve AVERAGE grades. It is certainly possible that a large portion of the students with the BEST grades took CBCs. As long as the AVERAGE of OC students who did not withdraw was higher than the AVERAGE of the CBC students who did not withdraw, it doesn't matter which group has the students with the BEST grades. For example, it is possible that the 10  students all took CBCs, the rest of the CBC students did poorly, and most of the OC students did fairly well.\n\nChoice (D)  be true, but we don't know for sure. And we certainly cannot determine that a  majority of the students with the best grades took OCs rather than CBCs. Eliminate (D).\n\nThe information in the passage does not offer any evidence to EXPLAIN the data. All we can determine is that the average of the OC students who did NOT withdraw has to be higher than the average of the CBC students who did not withdraw. A number of factors could explain this result (better teachers, better courses, etc). Choice (E) is a  explanation, but we cannot determine whether it is true based on the information in the passage. Eliminate (E).\n\nChoice (A) is the only statement that HAS to be true.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "explanation": "I don't know that there's a \"key\" to solving percent problems.  Of course ....\n\npercent = (Part)/(Whole)* 100\n\n... so in any CR question that discusses them, the direction of change of the percent (increase or decrease) does not necessarily have to be the same as the direction of change of the \"Part\", so long as the \"Whole\" also changes.  It just a matter of keeping straight, for any particular assertion --- are they talking about the \"percent\", the \"Part\", or the \"Whole\"? --- because information given could be about any of those three.  \n\nLet's look at this particular argument.  \n\nThat's the \"whole\" from which real estate tax is assessed.  \npercent = (Part)/(Whole)* 100\n(percent of property tax) = (total $ amount of property taxes)/(total market value of real estate)*100\n\nA bit redundant --- this sentence just points out that this same \"whole\"  --- the \"total market value of real estate\"  ---- is, of course, the basis of real estate tax.  Property tax is based on property!  \n\nOK, now we know --- \"percent\" stayed the same.  So, sentence #1 told us \"Whole\" declined\", and here we also know that \"percent\" stays the same --- this ineluctably means: \"Part\" must have also decreased.  That's the only way the \"Whole\" could decrease while the \"percent\" stays the same.  That \"Part\" would be the actual monetary amount of the property tax --- that must decrease.

        "question": "Most antidepressant drugs cause weight gain. While dieting can help reduce the amount of weight gained while taking such antidepressants, some weight gain is unlikely to be preventable. \n\nThe information above most strongly supports which one of the following?\n\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The correct answer choice is (C). \n\nThe causal relationship in this problem appears in the premise, and the argument is structured as follows: Premise: Most antidepressant drugs cause weight gain. Premise: Dieting can help reduce the amount of weight gained while taking such antidepressants. Conclusion: Some weight gain is unlikely to be preventable. Note that the causal premise specifically states that “most” antidepressants cause weight gain, not necessarily all antidepressants. Also, the second premise specifically refers to antidepressants causing weight gain (the use of “such” indicates this). The second premise also indicates that the amount gained can be reduced, not that dieting can stop weight gain. Perhaps the antidepressants cause a twenty pound weight gain, but dieting can reduce that to a ten pound total gain. The question stem is a Must Be True, and thus you must accept the stimulus information and find an answer that is proven by that information. \n\nAnswer choice (A): This is an Exaggerated answer. The stimulus indicates that most antidepressants cause weight gain, leaving open the possibility that some do not. This answer choice references any antidepressant drug. Further, the stimulus does not address the role of a physician or the advisability of prescribing certain drugs under certain conditions. The benefits of prescribing an antidepressant that causes weight gain to an overweight patient may well outweigh the negatives (pun intended). \n\nAnswer choice (B): This is also an exaggerated answer. The stimulus allows for antidepressants that do not cause weight gain. \n\n Some individuals taking antidepressants that cause weight gain will gain weight even though dieting can reduce the amount of the gain. \n\nAnswer choice (D): This is an Opposite answer. The stimulus and correct answer both indicate that people taking the weight gain-causing antidepressants will gain weight regardless of whether they diet. Thus, the weight gain cannot be attributed to a lack of dieting. \n\nAnswer choice (E): This answer is too strong. Not all patients necessarily take antidepressants that cause weight gain, so those that do not might not need to diet to maintain their weight.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "explanation": "- Naturally occurring chemicals (NOC) cannot be newly patented after their structures have been published.\n- Before NOC can be used as a drug, it needs to be tested and its chemical structure and observed effects published.\n\nThis implies that if an NOC is to be used as a drug, it cannot be newly patented.

        "question": "Advertisement: Today's customers expect high quality. Every advance in the quality of manufactured products raises customer expectations. The company that is satisified with the current quality of its products will soon find that its customers are not. At MegaCorp, meeting or exceeding customer expectations is our goal!\n\nWhich of the following must be true on the basis of the statements in the advertisement above?\n\n",
        "answer": "Edited the question.",
        "explanation": "To answer this question, let's first break the passage down into separate statements:\n\n be true. So, if we can find any reason why an answer choice  not be true, that's justification to drop it from consideration.\n\nThe passage discusses \"meeting or exceeding customer expectations,\"  \"attracting customers.\" It is possible that companies CAN attract customers without meeting or exceeding customer expectations -- maybe their products are the only option on the market, or maybe the product quality sucks but the price is great. Because companies can attract customers without adopting MegaCorp's goal, we can't say that MegaCorp's goal is the ONLY path to success. \n\nWe can't say that (A)  be true, so we can rule (A) out.\n\nThe passage tells us that any company not advancing the quality of its products is certain to fail to meet its customers' expectations in the long run. (B) flips this around and reverses the chain of reasoning.\n\nThis reversed chain of reasoning isn't supported by the passage. Maybe a company doesn't anticipate the expectations of its customers, but continues to advance the quality of its products (for instance, did customers  the invention of the smartphone? Or did companies just come up with the improved product, and thus keep their customers happy with tech improvements  \"correctly anticipating customer expectations\"). The passage allows for this chain of events, which means that (B) doesn't have to be true.\n\nEliminate (B).\n\nThe passage tells us that MegaCorp's goal is to meet or exceed its customers' expectations. We're told that customer expectations about product quality will rise as the quality of the products improves. For MegaCorp to meet its goal, it must continue to improve the quality of its products.\n\nHowever, if it is not possible to improve the quality of its products, MegaCorp cannot meet its goal. Its customers' expectations will continue to rise and MegaCorp will not be able to continue to improve its products to meet or exceed those expectations.\n\nMegaCorp can  meet its goal if it can continue to advance the quality of its products. (C) is looking good, let's keep it for now while we look at the remaining answer choices.\n\nThere is nothing in the passage to suggest a company that is satisfied with its products' quality will see the quality of its products .\n\nThe passage tells us that any company that allows the quality of their product to plateau will fall behind their customers' expectations. This does not mean the quality of their products will .\n\nSince we can't say that (D)  be true, (D) can't be our answer.\n\nWe are not given any information about how MegaCorp's customers feel about the quality of its products. We don't know whether MegaCorp is currently meeting its goal or not.\n\nSince we can't know this from the information in the passage, we can't say that (E)  be true. So we can cross (E) out.\n\nThat leaves us with (C).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

Newest product costs very little to make\n2. It appears doubtful the company will be able to sell it without increasing the markup the company usually allows for profit (lets say the company marks up its goods by 20% to allow for profit - it will need to increase this %) because potential clients would simply not believe that something so inexpensive would really work. \n3. Mechanicorp’s reputation is built on fair prices incorporating only modest profit margins. \n\nSo the new product costs very little to produce but the company will be unable to sell if it takes a modest profit because customers will not believe that a cheap product can work. To promote sales, it will have to take a higher profit margin. If the company does take a bigger profit, its reputation (of fair prices and modest margins) will be at stake.\n\n\nThis is what we can infer from the premises. Hence it is the correct option.\n\n\n(B) Mechanicorp achieves large annual profits, despite small profits per unit sold, by means of a high volume of sales.\n\nWe do not know whether it achieves large annual profits. We only know that it makes modest profits per product. Overall whether its profits are modest or large, premises do not tell us.

        "question": "Some people think that in every barrel of politicians there are only a few rotten ones. But if deceit is a quality of rottenness, I believe all effective politicians are rotten. They must be deceitful in order to do the job properly. Someone who is scrupulously honest about obeying the rules of society will never be an effective politician.\n\nAssuming that the author’s statements are accurate, which one of the following statements CANNOT be true?\n\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Let us look at all the answer choices to understand why.\n\n\n\nRefer to the first line of the passage. Some (not necessarily all) people think that there are only a few rotten politicians. From this, we can infer that there could also be some people who think that all politicians are rotten. Hence, we cannot definitely say that option (A) cannot be true. \n\n\n\nRefer to the last line of the passage. The author only claims that someone who is scrupulously honest will not make an  politician. He/She could still be a politician, albeit an ineffective one. In other words, there may exist politicians who are scrupulously honest (even if they are not effective politicians!). Hence, we cannot definitely say that option (B) cannot be true. \n\n\n\nThis option choice is out of scope. Because we do not know if any, some or all people define a politician's job as obeying the rules of society. Maybe 0% of all people, maybe 10%, may even be 100%. Obeying the rules of society is simply mentioned as a factor that connects to one being an effective politician. Maybe there exist some people who define a politician''s job this way. We cannot be sure. Hence, we cannot definitely say that option (C) cannot be true. \n\n\n\nRefer to the third line of the passage. Now, we only know that to do the job properly (i.e. be an effective politician), one needs to be deceitful. In other words, being deceitful is mandatory to be an effective politician. However, this does not mean that every deceitful politician is also an effective one. There can be a politician who is not effective, despite being deceitful. Hence, we cannot definitely say that option (D) cannot be true. \n\n\n\nWe have already eliminated the other 4, so this option must be the correct answer <img src=\"https://cdn.gmatclub.com/cdn/files/forum/images/smilies/1f642.png\" class=\"forumSmileyItem\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\":)\">. \nBut let us understand why this is correct. Refer to the last line of the passage. In essence it says that:\n\nIf (you are scrupulously honest about obeying the laws of society); then, (you cannot be an effective politician). This means that any and every politician who is scrupulously honest, will have to be an ineffective politician. \n\nThus, this option that states that some scrupulously honest politicians are effective, will never be true. Hence, we can definitely say that option (E) cannot be true. \n\nCheers!",

        "question": "The percentage of households with an annual income of more than $40,000 is higher in Merton County than in any other county. However, the percentage of households with an annual income of $60,000 or more is higher in Sommer County.\n\nIf the statements above are true, which of the following must also be true?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "With questions like this, there isn't a whole lot of analysis to be done up front. As always, we have to make sure that we are paying attention to the details and that we understand the given facts. However, we don't have a conclusion or a line of reasoning that we can break down. So let's just make sure we are clear about the given information:\n\n of households with an annual income of more than $40,000 is higher in Merton County (MC) than in any other county.\" Note that we don't know about the NUMBER of households. Also notice that it says \" $40,000\", so this group does not contain households with an annual income  $40,000. of households with an annual income of $60,000 or more is higher in Sommer County (SC).\" Again, we are dealing with percentages and not absolute numbers. However, in this case, the group includes the boundary figure (\"$60,000 \").\nIf the statements above are true, which of the following must also be true?\n\nMC might have, for example, 2% earning $80k+ while SC only has 1% (or less!) earning $80k+. As long as SC has a higher percentage with an annual income between $60k and $80k, SC could still have a higher percentage earning $60k+. Choice (A) does not have to be true, so eliminate this one.\n\nThere could be a third county that has a higher percentage earning $60k than MC. As we'll see in the explanation for choice (C), this would not necessarily mean that the third county has a higher percentage earning above $40k than MC. Choice (B) might be true, but it does not have to be true. Eliminate (B).\n\nLet's think about this logically. MC has the highest percentage above $40k. SC has the highest percentage of $60k or more. So how could that be true? Let's start by ignoring the group earning between $40-60k. We know that the percentage earning $60k or more in MC is  than the percentage earning $60k or more in SC. So if we omit the group earning between $40-60k, it would look like SC has a greater percentage earning above $40k. But we know that the opposite is true: the percentage earning above $40k is  in MC than in SC.\n\nSo how can we make the $40k+ percentage higher in MC without changing the fact that the $60k+ percentage is higher in SC? The only option is to make the $40-60k percentage higher in MC. In other words, if the $40k percentage is higher in MC even though the $60k percentage is LOWER in MC, then the percentage BETWEEN $40k and $60k must be higher in MC. In that case, the statement in choice (C) would have to be true, so hang on to this one.\n\nThe given facts pertain to percentages, not absolute numbers. SC might have a much greater population than MC, in which case choice (D) might not be true. Eliminate (D).\n\nThis might be true, but it depends on information that we are not given. SC might have a small percentage earning above $60k while MC has NO households earning above $60k. But MC might have a much larger percentage earning $40-60k. Furthermore, SC could have a much larger percentage earning less than, say, $20k, and that would drag down the overall average. We do not have enough information to determine whether (E) is true, so eliminate this one.\n\n(C) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

That claim is false, however, since according to Megaplex’s own sales figures, Megaplex sold 5% more popcorn last year than in the previous year.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the theatergoer's argument ? \n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": ",\nI got your private message, and I am happy to help.   &amp; , and so I will assume that we can ignore the first three and agree that they are incorrect.  Here's the argument with the last two choices only:\n: In January of last year the Megaplex chain of movie theaters started popping its popcorn in canola oil, instead of the less healthful coconut oil that it had been using until then. Now Megaplex is planning to switch back, saying that the change has hurt popcorn sales. That claim is false, however, since according to Megaplex’s own sales figures, Megaplex sold 5% more popcorn last year than in the previous year.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the theatergoer's argument ? \nD. Total attendance at Megaplex’s movie theaters was more than 20 percent higher last year than the year before.\nE. The year before last, Megaplex experienced a 10 percent increase in popcorn sales over the previous year. of people who like a product or make some kind of purchase, and much of marketing is concerned with increasing the total traffic, increasing the raw number of people encountering the venue, because if the total number increases, the same percent will result in much higher sales.   All of web marketing is based on this principle --- increase SEO &amp; visitors to the site, and a larger number of visitors to the site will result in more sales, even though the percent of visitors who purchase remains more or less constant.   \n\nLet's think about choice .   Suppose in January, 2012, they started using the canola oil (yuck!) rather than the good saturated-fat-filled coconut oil.   We will think about ,  and let's make it a little more extreme to understand better.  Suppose in 2011, the theater had 1,000,000 visitors, and in 2012, they had 2,000,000 visitors.   Instead of a 20% increase, we'll just say that it was 100% increase, for simplicity.   If the popcorn remained absolutely unchanged 2011 until 2012, then every marketing model on Earth would predict that, in 2012, with twice the people, they would sell twice the popcorn.  Very simple.  \nNow, consider the fact that, between 2011 and 2012, in addition to twice the visitors , from 1M to 2M, the theater also made the oil change to the popcorn, as as a result, popcorn increased only 5% from 2011 to 2012.   Without changing the oil, popcorn sales would have increased 100%, just as the visitors did (at least according to any marketing model on Earth), and with the oil change, popcorn sales increased only 5% --- not good.   If sales of the item grow at any rate less than the rate of traffic increase, that necessarily means that a lower percent of total visitors want the popcorn, and the only change to which this could be attributed is the change in the oil.   \nThus, choice  indicates there's a significant problem with the use of canola oil, which gives good reason for the theater's decision to change back to coconut oil, and therefore obliterates the theater goer's argument that the theater has no good reason for changing back.  \n\nChoice  is irrelevant, because it is talking about size of popcorn sale, and we don't know anything about how the number of theater goers changed.  Continuing the dates I was using above, let's say that in 2010, the theater experienced 10% increase in popcorn sales over the sales in 2009.  Now suppose that from 2008 to 2011, the number of visitors at the theater each year remained constant.  If the same number of people are coming, and they buy 10% more in popcorn, then that means more people are buying popcorn --- that's good.  But then, in January 2012, they change the oil, and the number of visitors wildly increases, but the popcorn sales don't wildly increase --- then, that's not so good.   This is just one possible scenario, but depending on how the number of theater visitors changed from year to year is exactly what determines whether the percent change in sales is a good thing or not.   What matters the most is how the percent change in total popcorn sales compares the percentage change in total number of customers --- what we most expect is for those to change in lock-step with one another, because that would mean the percent of people buying popcorn would remain constant;  if the percent change in total popcorn sales is greater than or less than the percent change in total visitors, that indicates a change in the percent of people who buy popcorn, and that typically doesn't change too much unless there's a good reason.  We don't have enough information in  to determined whether the information given is relevant or not.   \n\nDoes all this make sense?\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)",

        "explanation": "I don't know that there's a \"key\" to solving percent problems.

It just a matter of keeping straight, for any particular assertion --- are they talking about the \"percent\", the \"Part\", or the \"Whole\"? --- because information given could be about any of those three.  \n\nLet's look at this particular argument.  \n\nThat's the \"whole\" from which real estate tax is assessed.  \npercent = (Part)/(Whole)* 100\n(percent of property tax) = (total $ amount of property taxes)/(total market value of real estate)*100\n\nA bit redundant --- this sentence just points out that this same \"whole\"  --- the \"total market value of real estate\"  ---- is, of course, the basis of real estate tax.  Property tax is based on property!  \n\nOK, now we know --- \"percent\" stayed the same.  So, sentence #1 told us \"Whole\" declined\", and here we also know that \"percent\" stays the same --- this ineluctably means: \"Part\" must have also decreased.  That's the only way the \"Whole\" could decrease while the \"percent\" stays the same.  That \"Part\" would be the actual monetary amount of the property tax --- that must decrease.

You are answering the wrong question. We do not need to explain the increase in consumption.\n\nWe need to explain this apparent paradox: increased consumption of oil should have decreased oil reserve levels. Oil reserve levels did not drop.\n\nHow can we consume more oil, but have the same amount of oil in reserve? That discrepancy needs to be explained.\n\nI am not sure what went wrong.  \n\n is the \"same volume of oil\" available for extraction? There should be LESS.\n\nOption D does not explain the disparity. Option D probably makes things worse. \n\n1) A price drop does not explain the seeming contradiction between escalated consumption and oil reserves whose levels stayed the same although no new oil fields were discovered.\n\nA lower price cannot explain how available reserve levels can be the same as 10 years ago. Price changes do not create more extractable oil.\n\n2) Option D makes things worse.\nIf anything -- you are correct about this part -- decreased price equals increased consumption . . .\n\nBut a  increase in consumption should FURTHER decrease reserve levels. \nA price drop makes the discrepancy  (harder to explain).  \n\nIncreased consumption ... no new oil fields ... but proven oil reserve levels have not dropped?

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "In this question we have to resolve the paradox, i.e. how is it that during times of drought farmers are given less governmental aid. \n\nThe argument tells us the stipulations by which farmers receive aid: the government pays them x dollars, where x represents the difference in a preset price and the price at which farmers actually sell their crops \n\nFor example, if the government sets a price of $10/barrel of corn, and farmers are only able to sell their corn at $8/barrel, the government will pay them the difference. \n\nAccording to the prompt, there is a drought in 1983, and while it may seem reasonable that the government will have to help the farmers, that is not the case. The question asks us to choose an answer that can account for this discrepancy. \n\n(A)\tINCORRECT This answer fails to account for the paradox because it states that the government set the preset price so high that farmers were likely not to be able sell their crops at such a price. Therefore, the government would have to provide aid (its incentive would be to help farmers struggling with debt).\n\n(B)\tINCORRECT We are not concerned with the amount of food exported but the price of food. Out of scope. \n\n\n\n(D)\tINCORRECT This focuses on 1984 and fails to account for why the government paid farmers less during the drought year of 1983.

        "question": "In 1990 major engine repairs were performed on 10 percent of the cars that had been built by the National Motor Company in the 1970s and that were still registered. However, the corresponding figure for the cars that the National Motor Company had manufactured in the 1960s was only five percent.\n\nWhich one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the discrepancy?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Here is the OE from Kaplan:\n\nWhen asked to explain a discrepancy in the stimulus, the first step is to locate the discrepancy. The unusual thing in the situation described is that a smaller percentage of the older cars had engine work done. One might think that a greater percentage of older cars would need repairs, but notice that the stimulus refers to which automobiles had repairs, not which needed them. If the cars from the 1960s are probably in more need of repair, why have a greater percentage of 1970s cars received repairs? Maybe you tried to pre-phrase an answer. We’re dealing with percentages again, not raw numbers, so fewer older cars on the road wouldn’t make for a good answer. Maybe you considered the economics associated with repairs: If a car is worth $500, and engine repairs cost $1000, it probably doesn’t make much financial sense to get the car repaired. This is the idea that gets the point: If older cars are not worth the expense, and are scrapped instead of repaired, then the statistics described in the stimulus are understandable. (C) nicely clears up the\ndiscrepancy.\n\n(A) Inspection for emission levels probably would turn up more problems in older cars, which suggests that the older cars would have a greater percentage of repairs, so (A) only deepens the mystery.\n\n(B) New cars are out of the scope based on the dates provided in the passage. Even if we considered the 1970s cars “new” (at least, newer than cars from the 1960s), this choice would, like choice (A), make the facts even less understandable.\n\n(D) Whether or not simplified car engines result in fewer repairs is pretty shaky, but even if they did, (D) would also suggest that the sixties models would need more repairs.\n\n(E) chastises those negligent 60’s car owners for not maintaining their cars, but it doesn’t mention 1970s cars, and thus does nothing to explain the discrepancy.",

        "question": "Beets and carrots are higher in sugar than many other vegetables. They are also high on the glycemic index, a scale that measures the rate at which a food increases blood sugar levels. But while nutritionists usually advise people to avoid high-sugar and high-glycemic-index foods, despite any nutritional benefits they may confer, they are not very concerned about the consumption of beets and carrots.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, would best explain the nutritionists' lack of concern?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "- Fairly straightforward.\n\n - In addition, they also increase blood sugar levels at a high rate – they are high on the g-index.\n\n - This is a fairly complex sentence. Let’s break it up.\n\nNutritionists usually suggest not to consume high-sugar and high g-index foods.\n\nAnd that too despite whatever nutritional benefits the foods may have. So, no matter how beneficial foods may be in other ways, if they have high-sugar and are high on the g-index,  nutritionists advise against consuming such foods.\n\nYet, nutritionists do not advise against consuming beets and carrots.\n\nThe nutritionists’ lack of concern is fairly puzzling. On the one hand they claim that foods high in sugar and on the g-index should not be consumed no matter what the health benefits. On the other hand, they are indifferent to beets and carrots consumption.\n\nFirst instinct: are the nutritionists ‘high’?\n\nWe’re looking for a reason for why it isn’t bad to consume beets and carrots despite the red flags. Not able to predict a specific answer. Let’s evaluate the answer choices\n\n\n\n Sunblock blocks the UV rays and still lets them enjoy the sun and also gain vitamin D.\n\n(This is a hypothetical example. Please do not use it to load up on vitamin D ?\n\nThis option also provides similar reasoning. Something is used alongside that counters the negative effects.\n\n\n\n\n nutritionists understood this relation doesn’t matter. Now that they understand the importance, how come they are still indifferent to beets and carrots consumption? That’s what we need to figure out. This option does not help us resolve the nutritionists’ seemingly puzzling behavior.\n\n\nNotice the comparisons in the question – in the first statement, and also in option A.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "Archaeologists using a remote-controlled submarine to excavate an ancient shipwreck deep in the Mediterranean have been able to recover several objects from the site of the wreck. By chemically dating the ship's timbers and examining other objects, such as coins, the archaeologists estimated that the ship was wrecked in the fifth century",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The question asks us to find the choice that best explains \"the apparent discrepancy in the dates cited.\"\n\nReviewing the passage, we see that the discrepancy is that evidence indicates that the ship was wrecked in the fifth century (between 401 and 500 AD), but olive oil jars found on the site of the shipwreck cannot be from before the eighth century (701 - 800 AD).\n\n\n\nNotice that the minimum difference between the estimated time of the shipwreck and the time the jars were from is 701 - 500 or about 200 years. So, even if the archeologists' estimated date of the shipwreck is 50 years off and the shipwreck occurred in 550 AD, there's still no way the shipwreck occurred during the time the jars are from.\n\nSo, this choice doesn't explain the discrepancy.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice doesn't explain the discrepancy. Instead it serves to rule out a possible explanation for the discrepancy, that the olive oil jars are from another wreck that occurred nearby.\n\nSo, this choice basically deepens the mystery of the discrepancy.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice basically just confirms the discrepancy that the correct answer must explain. In other words, the fact that the timbers were all about the same age means that all the timbers are from a time long before the time the olive oil jars are from.\n\n\n\nThis choice explains the discrepancy by indicating that the olive oil jars likely do not have anything to do with the shipwreck discovered by the archeologists and simply have a different origin.\n\nAfter all, given what this choice says, the olive oil jars could be cargo that was jettisoned (thrown overboard) by sailors on a ship that was sailing long after the shipwreck occurred who wanted to lighten that ship because of a storm.\n\nKeep. \n\n\n\nThe fact that this evidence, seals, indicates that the jars and the coins came from the same  does not change the fact that the coins and the jars appear to be from different .\n\nRegardless of where the coins and the jars came from, we are still faced with the discrepancy between the time of the shipwreck and the time the jars are from, and this choice does not explain that discrepancy since the fact that the coins and jars are from the same place does not explain how they could be from different times.\n\nEliminate.\n\nThe correct answer is (D).",

There is a paradox, right? NO2 emissions have reduced in the country. New Durham has high proportion of new cars (cars with CCs) but still NO2 emissions have not reduced. Why?\n\nThere could be many reasons:\n- Perhaps number of cars bought recently have increased tremendously so even with reduced NO2 emissions per car, overall NO2 emissions have stayed same in New Durham. \n- Perhaps the way CCs work (the temperature they need etc) they are not suitable in New Durham.\netc\n\nA.

If people with weak systems were the first to go, they should have gone due to some immune system related complication. But this is not so. They often died due to heart disease.\n\nLet's look for an option that w ill explain this:\n\n(A) There were twice as many infections among those in the study with the weakest immune systems as among those with the strongest immune systems.\nIf people with weak immune systems had many more infections (which makes sense), then it also makes sense that they will die due to those infections and not heart diseases. Hence, we do not get an explanation of the paradox.\n\n(B) The majority of those in the study with the strongest immune systems died from infection or cancer by 1987.\nHow those with strongest immune systems died is out of scope.\n\n(C) Some of the drugs that had been used to treat the symptoms of heart disease had a side effect of weakening the immune system.\nThis explains our paradox. If medicine for symptoms of heart disease causes weak immune system, it means that people with heart disease would have weak immune systems too. Perhaps those were the people that we identified with weak immune systems. They died due to heart disease is then understandable since they had heart disease (the medicine is symptomatic treatment only).\n\n(D) Most of those in the study who survived beyond the two-year period had recovered from a serious infection sometime prior to 1978.\nOut of scope.

        "question": "Collision Avoidance Technology (CAT) is the latest technology for improving the safety of drivers on the road. In a recent study conducted by the Highway Data Loss Institute (HDLI), the researchers found that individuals driving the Volvo XC60—a specific model equipped with CAT—reported 27 percent fewer auto insurance claims than did drivers of comparable vehicles. In spite of this, the research concluded that CAT is not expected to significantly bring down the rates of auto accidents in the long run.\n\nWhich of the following most helps to explain the above situation?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Pre-thinking\n\nConclusion Clarification\nThe research concluded that despite the relatively fewer auto insurance claims reported by individuals driving the vehicle having CAT, CAT is not expected to significantly bring down the rates of auto accidents in the long run.\nPre-Thinking Approach\nTo resolve the paradox, let’s see how we can select a scenario in which both situations can be true without contradicting each other. To do so, we will look at the logical structure, focusing on the seemingly contradictory situations.\n•\tPotential explanations\n•\tInstance 1: What if there is some other factor related to CAT that leads to increased accidents? In such a case, it’s possible that despite the safety provided by CAT, the overall accidents won’t come down significantly.\n For example: What if the improved safety of the cars makes drivers take the safety measures for granted? The very fact that they are safer because of CAT can make them negligent while driving, increasing the risk of accident. Thus, such a scenario may explain why CAT is not expected to bring down the rates of auto accidents in the long run. \nAnswer Choices\n\nChoice A\n•\tIncorrect - Doesn’t explain the situation\no\tWe know that individuals driving XC60 had made fewer claims. \no\tIf their tendency to make claims is high but they still made lower claims, then it could mean that CAT worked very well in avoiding accidents. \no\tThen, the conclusion that it won’t bring down accidents in the long term becomes even more puzzling.\nChoice B\n•\tIncorrect - Doesn’t explain the situation\no\tEven if some car makers don’t make such arrangements, there might be others who do so and thus CAT can still bring down auto accidents significantly if the proportion of those who make this arrangement is high. \no\tAlso, this statement talks about only the current situation whereas the conclusion of the research talks about the long run. A current impediment can’t be taken as a definite problem in the long term.\nChoice C\n•\tCorrect\no\tThis option is written along the lines of our pre-thinking per instance1. If many drivers drive carelessly because of the enhanced safety available in the form of CAT, it may give rise to more auto accidents.\no\tThere are other technologies currently in the market that also improve the safety of the drivers, but none of them has been successful.\nChoice D\n•\tIncorrect - Doesn’t explain the situation\no\tThe fact that none of the other technologies that improve the safety of the drivers have been successful doesn’t explain why CAT in particular will not have a certain effect, i.e. bring down the rates of auto accidents in the long run.\n\nChoice E\n•\tIncorrect- Doesn’t explain the situation\no\tThis option tells us that research was carried out for a shorter time than estimated.  However, we can’t derive whether it’s good or bad that the research was conducted for a shorter time than estimated. The duration of the research is not related to the impact of CAT on the rate of accident.",

Such managers have an enormous stake in succeeding, so they invariably overstate the potential of their new technologies. Surprisingly, however, market researchers typically do not survey a new technology's potential buyers, even though it is the buyers—not the producers—who will ultimately determine a technology's commercial success.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, best accounts for the typical survey practices among market researchers?\n",

        "explanation": "Responding to a pm:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following, if true, best accounts for the typical survey practices among market researchers?\n\nLet's find out what the survey practices are.\n\nMarket surveyors try to find the new technology that will be a commercial success in the near future (perhaps to invest or whatever). They survey the managers that are developing new technologies (who tend to overstate the potential of their new technologies). \nHowever, market researchers typically do not survey the potential buyers (even though it is the buyers who determine commercial success). \n\nHere is the problem. The researchers survey the managers (even though their opinion may be biased) but not the buyers (whose opinion drives commercial success). What will resolve this paradox? If they survey 'just the buyers' or at least 'the buyers too'. They want the opinion of the managers, they can take it but they MUST take the opinion of the buyers. The paradox here is that they don't take the opinion of the buyers. All you have to do is find what explains the reason they don't survey the buyers.\n\nWhat explains the paradox? Option (D) - they are unable to identify the buyers and hence they can't survey the buyers. \n\nOption (A) tells you that the commercial success accrues mainly to the producers, not the buyers. This gives the producers a reason to create unwarranted hype about their product. So this just tells you that why manager's opinion may not be very relevant.

Both of them use the same fact to support their perspective. Shirla makes an assumption that since they have succeeded on the amateur circuit in the past, the professionals would still likely be successful, and would thus have an unfair advantage. Ron makes an assumption that a significant amount of time has passed between the skaters’ amateur and professional competitions.

Hence, there are usually more doctors than orderlies working in the emergency room.\n\n\n\n(C) The bill paid by a patient at the emergency room is directly proportional to the number of medical professionals the patient sees during his or her visit. Since the number of patients going through the emergency room is increasing, it follows that the emergency room is collecting a greater amount in fees paid by patients than it used to.\n\n\n\n(D) The increase in patients at the emergency room is directly proportional to the amount of advertising the hospital has done the previous year. The hospital seeks to attract more patients to its emergency room by increasing the amount the hospital spends on advertising.\n\n \n\n(E) The amount of analgesics prescribed in an emergency room is directly proportional to the number of patients that go through the emergency room on a given day.

        "question": "Because migrant workers are typically not hired by any one employer for longer than a single season, migrant workers can legally be paid less than the minimum hourly wage that the government requires employers to pay all their permanent employees. Yet most migrant workers work long hours each day for eleven or twelve months a year and thus are as much full-time workers as are people hired on a year-round basis. Therefore, the law should require that migrant workers be paid the same minimum hourly wage that other full-time workers must be paid.\n\nThe pattern of reasoning displayed above most closely parallels that displayed in which one of the following arguments?\n\n",

However, nothing in this answer choice indicates that the different counties have the same reasons for regulating gun sales.\n\n(D) No. The point of the passage is that although migrant workers do not meet the exact criteria for being full-time employees they work as much as full-time employees and therefore should receive some of the same benefits. This answer-choice does not indicate that club and restaurant owners are treated differently from other parties with whom these owners share some essential characteristic.\n\n The point of the passage is that although migrant workers do not meet the exact criteria for being full-time employees they work as much as full-time employees and therefore should receive some of the same benefits.

        "question": "While black or green tea tends to be the leaf of choice among connoisseurs, recent studies have indicated there are significant benefits to drinking white tea. White tea is considerably more delicate and rarer than black or green tea and has fewer producers. Because it is unprocessed and unfermented, white tea has very high levels of catechins, which are known for having antibiotic qualities and delaying aging. Additionally, white tea has elevated levels of theobromine, a substance that can improve circulation. To produce white tea, basic tea leaves are picked when they are very young, so white tea contains considerably less fluoride than black or green tea and much higher levels of theanine, which is known for its relaxing qualities. Research indicates that white tea has an amount of caffeine comparable to that of either black or green tea.\n\nThe passage implies all of the following EXCEPT:\n\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Question presents the student with information about white tea, noting specifically its similarities and differences to black and green tea. The author of the passage mentions that white tea is usually more “delicate” and “rarer” than black or green tea and that it contains higher levels of certain chemicals—many of which have very positive health effects. The question then asks the student to identify the answer choice that is not implied in the passage. This is a fairly difficult question to answer correctly, because the student has to look closely to know for sure that the incorrect answers actually are implied. The correct answer, in this case, will be the answer choice that has absolutely no substance in the passage and cannot be inferred from any statements made.\n\n\n\nD The author of the passage mentions that white tea “contains considerably less fluoride than black or green tea.” The author makes no comment anywhere else in the paragraph to indicate whether or not fluoride is a typical ingredient in tea, so it is impossible to determine from this alone if the lack of fluoride is viewed as a positive or a negative quality. Because the author of the passage is silent, answer choice (D) cannot be clearly inferred, so it is correct.\n\n\n\nA The author of the passage claims that white tea is “more delicate and rarer than black or green tea and has fewer producers.” From this, the student may deduce that a delicate, rare product with few producers may be more costly than its counterparts—as the answer choice claims. Answer choice (A), therefore, may be inferred, so it is incorrect.\n\nB In the middle of the passage, the student will read the following: “To produce white tea, basic tea leaves are picked when they are very young.” This implies strongly that white tea is just a product of regular tea leaves being picked at a young age and is not necessarily a different variety than black or green tea. Answer choice (B) may be inferred, so it is incorrect.\n\nC The passage notes several times the differences between white tea and black or green tea, in each case identifying the chemicals contained in white tea that may improve health. From this, the student may deduce that there are possible health benefits to drinking white tea, benefits that are not obtained from drinking black or green tea. The passage implies answer choice (C), so it is incorrect.\n\nE Answer choice (E) might be the most difficult answer choice to eliminate, because it requires that the student read the passage very carefully and infer very closely. Toward the end of the passage, the author claims that white tea has “much higher levels of theanine, which is known for its relaxing qualities.” In the final sentence, the author concludes with the statement that white tea has “an amount of caffeine comparable to that of either black or green tea.” If white tea has the same amount of caffeine as black or green tea but higher levels of a chemical that is known to induce relaxation, it may be inferred that the theanine in white tea has the potential to counter the effects of caffeine. Answer choice (E), then, is implied, so it is incorrect\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "Dana intentionally watered the plant every other day. But since the plant was a succulent, and needed dry soil, the frequent watering killed the plant. Therefore Dana intentionally killed the plant.\n\nWhich one of the following arguments exhibits a flawed pattern of reasoning most similar to the flawed pattern of reasoning exhibited in the argument above?\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "This is a good example of how modifiers can create logical confusion _ in this case, the modifier \"intentionally.\" Dana intentionally watered the plant. Her actions led to the plant’s death. Therefore Dana intentionally killed the plant? This conclusion is unwarranted. (Just for fun, step outside of the LSAT for a moment and consider this argument. Can you imagine wanting to kill a plant, and then deciding to do so by over-watering it over the course of several days or weeks?)\n\nIt is plausible, if not likely, that Dana did not know that watering the plant frequently would lead to its death. The insertion of the word \"intentionally\" in the conclusion is the big error. While it is true that Dana caused the plant to die (killed it), there is insufficient evidence to conclude that she killed it intentionally. When we evaluate the choices, we should look for this false \"intention\" in the conclusion. (C) demonstrates the same flaw. Yes, the owner took the item off the menu, and yes that decision disappointed Jerry, but did the owner intend to disappoint Jerry?\n\n(A) is incorrect because it does not match the original argument whatsoever. It includes no incorrect assumption of intentionality.\n(B) is wrong because it does not match the original argument, and doesn’t even represent a flawed argument. This reasoning is actually quite sound. \n(D) does not represent flawed reasoning. A caused B, B caused C, therefore A caused C.\n(E) is like (D). A caused B, and whatever caused B caused C.

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "To answer this question, we need to identify the argument’s structure and the author’s tone. The argument has two parts. First, a statement is made. Then it is questioned by drawing an extreme analogy. By putting the conclusion in question form, the author hopes you will be more likely to come to the same conclusion she did. It’s important to note the sarcasm in the analogy. Obviously, watching someone else eat doesn’t fill your own stomach. The author implies it is equally unlikely that watching violent movies will dissipate aggressive energy, or satisfy one’s need for violence.\n\nIn the argument, the writer throws out a statement and then ridicules it by drawing an extreme analogy. Look at choice (D). It presents a statement: “Some people think that economists can control inflation.” Then ridicules it with an extreme analogy: “Can meteorologists make the sun shine?” \n\n(B) is somewhat tempting. It does have the same basic structure as the original argument—a statement is offered and then questioned. However, the tone in (B) is not sarcastic. Furthermore, the question “Hasn’t nationalism been the excuse for committing abominable crimes?” isn’t in analogy form.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "When the economy is in a recession, overall demand for goods and services is low. If overall demand for goods and services is low, bank interest rates are also low. Therefore, if bank interest rates are not low, the economy is not in a recession.\n\nThe reasoning in which one of the following most closely parallels the reasoning in the argument above?\n\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Parallel Reasoning-SN. The correct answer choice is (B)\n\nThis is a simple conditional linkage and contrapositive reasoning. The diagram of the stimulus is as follows:\n\nEconomy Recession ..... :arrow: ..... Demand Low\n\nDemand Low ..... :arrow: ..... Interest Rates Low\n\nTherefore, Interest Rates Low ..... :arrow: ..... Economy Recession\nWe can see that the conclusion is correct by linking the first and second premise, and drawing the contrapositive: Interest Rates Low ..... :arrow: ..... Demand Low ..... :arrow: ..... Economy Recession\n\nAnswer choice (A): Even though it is a correct reasoning in this choice, there is no conditional linkage and thus it does not parallel the stimulus.\n\nRestaurant Full ..... :arrow: ..... Parking Lot Full\n\nParking Lot Full ..... :arrow: ..... Restaurant Full\n\nTherefore, Parking Lot Full ..... :arrow: ..... Restaurant Full\n\nAs we can see, the conclusion is merely the contrapositive of the first premise, and there is no third term and conditional linkage. Thus this is not the correct answer.\n\nAnswer choice (B): This is the correct answer choice. The diagram of this answer choice is as follows:\n\nFish Ready ..... :arrow: ..... Cooked Through\n\nCooked Through ..... :arrow: ..... White\n\nTherefore, White ..... :arrow: ..... Fish Ready\n\nWe can see that the reasoning is valid by linking the first and second premise, and finding the contrapositive. Thus it perfectly parallels the stimulus' reasoning, and is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer choice (C): This answer choice is not correct since there is no conditional linkage and a second premise.\n\nFlew by Flapping Wings ..... :arrow: ..... Warm Blooded\n\nTherefore, Warm Blooded ..... :arrow: ..... Flew by Flapping Wings\nIt is not the correct answer since there is no second premise, no third term, and no conditional linkage. Thus it does not parallel the stimulus' reasoning.\n\nAnswer choice (D): In this case, even though there is conditional linkage, the conclusion is not a contrapositive of the inference, as it is for the stimulus:\n\nPleats ..... :arrow: ..... Double Material\n\nDouble Material ..... :arrow: ..... Not Enough for Top\n\nTherefore, Pleats ..... :arrow: ..... Not Enough for Top\n\nEven though there are two premises and conditional linkage, the conclusion is not a contrapositive of the inference, as it is for the stimulus. Thus this is not the correct answer.\n\nAnswer choice (E): This answer is incorrect since it is a mistaken reversal.\n\nForecasters Right ..... :arrow: ..... Inflation\n\nInflation ..... :arrow: ..... Government Lose Election\n\nTherefore, Government Lose Election ..... :arrow: ..... Forecasters Right\nAs we can see, the conclusion is a mistaken reversal of the inference between the first and second premise. Thus it is not a valid reasoning and not the correct answer.",

        "question": "Psychologists conducted an experiment in which half of the volunteers were asked to describe an unethical action they had performed, while the other half were asked to describe an ethical action they had performed. Some of the volunteers, chosen at random from each of the two groups, were encouraged to wash their hands afterward. Among those who described unethical actions, those who washed their hands were significantly less likely to volunteer for another, similar experiment than those who did not wash their hands. The researchers concluded that some of the subjects failed to volunteer again in part because of their having described an unethical action.\n\nWhich of the following would, if true, most help to support the researchers' conclusion?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Researchers found that some participants in the first experiment were more likely to volunteer for a second experiment.\n\nWhat led to that finding?\n.\n\nBut what does the evidence say?\n and choosing to volunteer again, but the researchers do NOT address that correlation.\n\nNow, the question becomes how we can support the conclusion that the primary issue is the ethical/unethical storytelling, NOT the hand-washing.\n\nSo, we’re looking for an answer choice that can both disentangle these two variables (hand-washing and ethical/unethical storytelling) and support the idea that describing an unethical action discouraged volunteers from volunteering again.\n\nWith that in mind, let’s take a look at the answer choices:\n\nIf (A) is true, then the likelihood volunteers choose to volunteer again appears to depend, in part, on whether they washed their hands. But even then, the researchers conclusion is about the impact of describing an unethical action, not washing hands. Eliminate (A).\n\n(B) is interesting. If the likelihood of volunteering again is higher among those who described ethical actions than those who described unethical actions, then it seems to be true that the type of action described by a volunteer has an impact on his/her choice to volunteer again. Moreover, (B) removes the second variable, hand-washing, that would otherwise influence the decision to volunteer again. So, (B) both eliminates a possible alternative explanation for the decision to volunteer again and provides support for the researchers’ explanation of the decision to volunteer again. Let’s keep (B).\n\nThe researchers’ conclusion focuses on the impact of describing an unethical action on choosing to volunteer again. Relatively little support is given for that conclusion, but even that support is not related to the choices of volunteers that washed or did not wash their hands. For that reason, (C) is irrelevant, and we can eliminate it.\n\nAgain, despite the large quantity of information given in the passage about volunteers washing their hands, that information has little to do with the researchers’ conclusion.

        "question": "In contemplating major purchases, businesses often consider only whether there is enough money left from monthly revenues after paying monthly expenses to cover the cost of the purchase. But many expenses do not occur monthly; taking into account only monthly expenses can cause a business to overexpand. So the use of a cash-flow statement is critical for all businesses.\n\nWhich one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Ideally, when you arrived at the end of this argument you said to yourself, “Cash flow statement? What the **** is a cash flow statement? Where did that come from?!” If you are able to recognize that the term “cash flow statement” appeared nowhere else in the argument besides the conclusion, you are definitely on the right track. That’s just not a legitimate argumentative strategy on the LSAT. The concepts  connect together. If you’re going to tell me I need to have a cash flow statement, you better well provide some Goddamn evidence about why cash flow statements are necessary.\n\nHere, the evidence was only about the importance of considering longer-term expenses instead of monthly expenses. Well, let’s take Fox LSAT as an easy example. I do take into account long-term expenses (I’m not an idiot) but there is no way in hell I am going to waste my time generating a cash-flow statement every month. There are other ways to plan. Personally, I just make sure to keep some money aside for irregular/unplanned expenses. There’s no “cash flow statement” involved in keeping a little cash in reserve.\n\nWe’re asked to strengthen the argument, so I’d love an answer that protects against my objection by connecting the facts to the conclusion. Something like, “The cash flow statement is the best/only/easiest way to plan for irregular/unplanned expenses” would be a very nice answer.\n\nA) Close, but the problem stipulated in the facts isn’t monthly expenses. The problem is  expenses. We’re not worried about monthly expenses, because it’s acknowledged in the argument that many companies just pay all their monthly expenses first, then spend whatever’s left. It’s the longer-term and irregular expenses that are the issue.\n\nB) No, the point was, “Use a cash flow statement so that you  overexpand.” This answer only addresses what’s happened when you’ve already overextended yourself.\n\nC) This does not have the magic words “cash flow statement.” There is no way in hell the correct answer doesn’t include those words.\n\nD) Aha! This matches our prediction. If this is true, then a cash flow statement is the only way (i.e., it’s necessary, i.e., it’s “critical”) for tracking non-monthly expenses. (And monthly expenses as well, although that’s irrelevant.) This answer does more than we need it to, but that’s just fine if we’re trying to strengthen the argument.\n\nE) Again, this lacks the magic words “cash flow statement.”\n\nOur answer is D, because it’s the only one that plugs up the giant hole in the logic.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "answer": "formatted",
        "explanation": "This is a strengthen critical reasoning question.  On these first develop a solid understanding of the argument, and then if possible predict what a correct answer choice would look like.\n\nThe argument here is:\n\nPremise: Redemption rate of e-mailed coupons is lower than paper coupons\nPremise: Those who might benefit the most from using coupons (homemakers, etc) often do not have the knowledge and equipment necessary to go online and receive coupons\nConclusion: The fact that those who might benefit most from using coupons don't have the resources to obtain them (the \"digital divide\") is one of the factors contributing to a lower rate of redemption for e-mailed coupons than paper coupons.\n\nAs for my prediction, I am keeping it vague and looking for some evidence that, if given easier access to these e-mailed coupons, these people would actually be more likely to redeem them.\n\nAnswer choice A - This would weaken the argument because it is belittling the idea of the digital divide by showing other resources that these people can use to obtain the coupons.  This is a trap answer, because we are trying to strengthen the argument.\n\nAnswer choice B - This strengthens the argument and is thus correct.  If some of the people discussed in the second premise, the people who would benefit most from using coupons, use an abnormally large amount of ordinary coupons then most likely they would use more e-mailed coupons if they were more readily available.\n\nAnswer choice C - The lack of resources has already been covered in the second premise, so this does not strengthen the argument.  Repeating a premise will never strengthen or weaken an argument.\n\nAnswer choice D - This is out of scope.  The difference in usage amongst different members of the group is not important.\n\nAnswer choice E - This is out of scope also.  The redemption rate of e-coupons now compared to in the past doesn't matter.\n\nI hope this helps!",

This choice serves to rule out that possibility.\n\nIn other words, if, as this choice says, the diesel car encountered greater wind resistance than the the gasline powered car, then we know for sure that the diesel car didn't use less fuel merely because it was helped by the wind. So, given what this choice says, we have more reason to believe that the diesel car is indeed more fuel-efficient than the gasoline powered car.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThis general fact about fuel economy \"for all cars\" does not indicate anything about which of the two cars tested is more fuel-efficient.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is the opposite of (C). (I don't think I've ever before seen in a Strengthen question two choices that are opposites or conflict.)\n\nSo, whereas choice (C) strengthens the argument, this choice weakens it.\n\nAfter all, if this choice is true, then there's a possible alternative explanation for the fact that the diesel powered car used less fuel.

        "question": "Mayor: In each of the past five years, the city has cut school funding and each time school officials complained that the cuts would force them to reduce expenditures for essential services. But each time, only expenditures for nonessential services were actually reduced. So school officials can implement further cuts without reducing any expenditures for essential services.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most strongly supports the mayor’s conclusion?\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic, edited the question and added the OA.",

Just because something happened previously doesn't mean that it will happen again in the future! What we really care about is what's going to happen next, and we need the following information to accept the mayor's conclusion:\n\n for essential services and nonessential services..\nSo let's look for the answer choice that most fills in these blanks, making us more likely to believe that the next cut can be implemented without any reduction in essential expenditures.\n\nThe schools' efficiency in providing essential services has nothing to do with whether they have enough money in the bank to avoid cutting expenditures on those services. Choice (A) doesn't provide any information that would fill our logical gap, so let's eliminate it.\n\nThis helps out quite a bit! If we know that the schools have money in the bank to provide nonessential services, the we know that some (potentially all) of the next cut can be taken out of these particular funds, instead of being taken out of the funds for essential services.\n\nIt would be great to know how big the cut will be, but the conclusion is that school officials can implement  cuts, not some specific size of cut. If there are $X in the bank for nonessential services, at least $X can be further cut from overall funding without any reduction in spending on essential services.\n\nChoice (B) doesn't prove the conclusion, but it definitely makes the conclusion easier to believe. Let's keep it around and see if any of the remaining choices are better.\n\nHm, so choice (C) tells us that the cost of nonessential services isn't much more than it was last year. But how much was it last year? How much is it today? And how does this cost relate to how much funding schools will have after the cut? We still don't have the information we need to assess how the next cut will impact the amount needed for essential services.\n\nAs a result, choice (C) doesn't support the mayor's conclusion nearly as much as choice (B), so let's eliminate it and keep going.\n\nThe stance of city administrators on these services has nothing to do with how much money the schools have and how much schools need in order to avoid reducing expenditures on those  services. Eliminate (D).\n\nThe conclusion itself doesn't question the accuracy or honesty of the school officials. The conclusion states that after the next cut, there will be no cuts to expenditures on essential services. Choice (E), like choice (D) and choice (A), doesn't do anything to fill in the gaps that we need to support this conclusion, so we'll eliminate it.\n\n(B) remains the best choice, because it does more than any other choice to make the mayor's conclusion believable.\n\nBut between you and me, even if (B) were true, I would never vote for a mayor who is this bad at critical reasoning. Please take these lessons to heart, find success with your MBA, and become a better mayor for your town.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

Fault =&gt; Seepage =&gt; Dangerous nuclear waste for up to 25,000 years/.\n Don't store nuclear waste under this mountain until it is investigated for geological faults.\n\n: Find evidence that supports the geologist's caution about the potential fault in the mountain or the importance of conducting the investigation.\n\n\nThis is irrelevant to the geologist's argument. The potential risk of nuclear waste seepage is based on the danger it poses regardless of whether human civilization exists. This does not address the geologist's concern about the faults. If anything, it might weaken the argument as the non-existence of a human civilization may indicate we don't need to worry so much about the future dangers of nuclear waste. \nThis choice directly supports the geologist's argument. If the investigation can conclusively determine the presence of faults, it justifies the geologist's recommendation to investigate before deciding on the storage location. It strengthens the argument by showing the investigation's necessity and potential to provide critical information.\n\nThis fact does not address the argument about the potential geological fault or the need for an investigation. Whether the facility was initially intended for nuclear waste storage is irrelevant to the argument's main concern about safety and the geological fault .\nThis weakens the argument rather than strengthens it. Mentioning the cost increase could be used as a counterargument against the investigation rather than a reason to support it. \nThis suggests a possible alternative but does not address the core issue of the geological fault's potential danger.

I understand that there is a ‘right size’ for pupation to happen. The statement says that only when a caterpillar reaches this stage.

So, before a caterpillar reaches this stage (grown to the right size for pupation to happen), this special enzyme doesn’t halt the production of juvenile hormone.

How will it kill them? By stopping them from feeding.

        "question": "Under United States law, a distinctive package design can be legally protected against copying. Lorex shampoo, a leading brand, is packaged in a triangular-shaped bottle with a gold label. A major pharmacy chain has introduced a similar, less expensive shampoo in similarly shaped bottles with plain black-and-white labels carrying the chain's name. Though the triangular shape is distinctive, the manufacturer of Lorex has not legally challenged its use for the chain's shampoo.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, provides the strongest reason for the manufacturer of Lorex not to challenge the chain's use of the triangular package design?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The passage provides only facts and not a conclusion.\n\nThen, the question asks us to find a reason for the manufacturer of Lorex NOT to challenge the chain's use of the triangular package design.\n\nSo, we can treat this question as a Strengthen the Argument question in which we must find a choice that supports the implied conclusion that the manufacturer should not challenge the chain's use of the design.\n\n\n\nThis choice may seem a bit off topic since it's not about packaging.\n\nNotice, however, that this choice does provide a reason for the manufacturer not to challenge the chain's use of the package design. After all, if the manufacturer of Lorex depends on the willingness of the chain to stock the manufacturer's products, then it may not be in the best interests of the manufacturer of Lorex to challenge the chain's use of the design. After all, the chain might retaliate by refusing to stock the manufacturer's products.\n\nSo, even though this choice does not discuss packaging, it does do what the correct answer must do, which is provide support for the conclusion that the manufacturer should not challenge the chain's use of the design.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nIf anything, this choice provides a reason for the manufacturer TO challenge the chain's use of the design.\n\nAfter all, this choice indicates that the chain is using the design and at the same time using a label that causes Lorex to be compared unfavorably in terms of cost with the chain's product.\n\nSo, this choice  does the opposite of what  we need.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice may explain why the chain's shampoo is less expensive than Lorex: it costs less to produce.\n\nAt the same time, we don't need an explanation. We need a reason for the manufacturer not to challenge the chain's use of the design, and the fact that the cost of manufacturing the chain's shampoo is substantially lower than the cost of manufacturing Lorex is not a reason not to challenge the chain's use of the design.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice indicates that, if the manufacturer challenges the chain's use of the design, the manufacturer's challenge will likely be successful.\n\nIf anything that information is a reason TO challenge the design. After all, it makes more sense to do something that will likely be successful than to do something that is not likely to be  successful.\n\nSo, this choice does the opposite of what we need.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice has no clear effect on the case for the manufacturer's not challenging the chain's use of the design. After all, regardless of the fact that the manufacturer manufactures other shampoos, it still may or may not make sense for the manufacturer to challenge the chain's use of the design of the the Lorex bottle.\n\nPeople sometimes choose this choice because it's the last one in the question or because they make up an extended, \"suppose this ... suppose that\" story about this choice. So, to avoid choosing a choice like this one, we have to be careful not to make up unsupported stories.\n\nEliminate.\n\nThe correct answer is (A).",

While the argument claims that the reduced speed limit saved lives, this answer-choice indicates an alternative possibility and therefore weakens the argument.\n\n(B) No. This does not explain why traffic fatalities decreased during the first eleven years following the speed limit reduction.\n\n(C) No. This would weaken the argument because the safety equipment, not the reduced speed limit, might be responsible for the decreased rate of fatalities.\n\n This strongly indicates that the decrease in speed reduced the chance of fatal injuries during automobile accidents. A lower speed limit (presuming some people obey it) should therefore reduce the rate of highway fatalities.\n\n(E) No. This suggests that accidents can be avoided by matching speeds with surrounding traffic—regardless of what the speed is. In this case, a lower speed limit should not affect the number of accidents. Note, although this implies the probability of an accident shouldn’t be affected by the speed, conceivably the chance of fatalities if an accident does occur might be affected by the speed.

Its first 80 pages are by a single copyist, but the remaining 20 pages are by three different copyists, which indicates some significant disruption. Since a letter in handwriting identified as that of the fourth copyist mentions a plague that killed many people in Florence in 1148, Codex Berinensis was probably produced in that year. \n\nWhich of the following, if true, most strongly supports the hypothesis that Codex Berinensis was produced in 1148?\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "The author concludes that \"Codex Berinensis [CB] was probably produced in [1148]\". How does the author arrive at that hypothesis?\n\nFirst, some background information:\n\n explanation. A plague killing many people could have certainly disrupted the production of CB (as the copyists and/or their loved ones became sick).\nTo review the author's argument...\n\nIf we DID have other samples of the copyists' handwriting, then that might help us date the document. But the lack of such evidence does not strengthen or weaken the hypothesis. Eliminate (A).\n\nWe already know that the plague \"killed many people.\" So, regardless of its length, the plague could certainly have disrupted production. Also, (B) doesn't help us determine whether production could have been disrupted in other years. (B) doesn't help us, so eliminate this one.\n\n(C) tells us that it probably took the last three copyists about 20 days to complete CB. So what? Why were there three copyists? Was the disruption caused by the plague of 1148? Choice (C) certainly supports the idea that CB could have been completed in less than a year, but it does not help us determine the year in which the work actually was done. Eliminate (C).\n\nIf there were multiple outbreaks of plague in Florence in the 1100s (i.e. 1105, 1148, and 1179), then the disruption could have occurred during ANY of those outbreaks. This would obviously weaken the hypothesis. Choice (D) eliminates this possiblity, thus strengthening the hypothesis. Hang on to this one.\n\nAs with choice (C), (E) gives us information about the copyists' output. Each new copyist was less productive than the last. This is interesting, but it doesn't tell us anything about WHEN the document was produced. It doesn't even help us determine how long it took to produce the document. Choice (E) is irrelevant and can be eliminated.\n\n(D) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

If anything, I would say that this information increases the probability that the plan will achieve its desired purpose i.e. the productivity of the people will increase. The employees who work 10 hrs 4 days do not do it on their own accord and according to what works best for them; instead, they do it because their supervisors told them to. Hence, their productivity is higher not because their body works best in this manner and hence they chose to work this way but because somehow, this 10 hrs 4 days schedule increased their productivity. This means that if others are also told by their supervisors to work 10 hrs 4 days, their productivity might increase too. \n\nC says that 10 hrs has allowed people to work alone for 2 hrs. This alone time increased their productivity. If everybody is made to work for 10 hrs, there will be no alone time for anyone. Hence, we would expect the productivity of current 10 hrs 4 day slot people to decrease and the productivity of the rest of the employees to stay the same.

        "question": "Urban planner: When a city loses population due to migration, property taxes in that city tend to rise. This is because there are then fewer residents paying to maintain an infrastructure that was designed to support more people. Rising property taxes, in turn, drive more residents away, compounding the problem. Since the city of Stonebridge is starting to lose population, the city government should therefore refrain from raising property taxes.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, would most weaken the urban planner's argument?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To weaken an argument, you have to be clear regarding what the conclusion of that argument is. The conclusion of this argument is that the city government of Stonebridge should refrain from raising property taxes.\n\nThus, to weaken the argument, we need a choice that shows that even though tax increases can result in a compounding of a city’s issues related to outmigration, the conclusion that Stonebridge should refrain from raising tax rates does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n(A) If Stonebridge does not raise taxes on its residents to maintain its infrastructure, the city will become much less attractive to live in as that infrastructure decays.\n\nWhile this choice does not counter the idea that raising tax rates could drive people to move away from Stonebridge, it does indicate that refraining from raising rates would lead to a situation in which the attractiveness of living in Stonebridge would be decreased. A decrease in attractiveness of living in Stonebridge could influence people to move away as much as or even more than an increase in taxes would.\n\nTherefore, as it provides a reason to question the idea that refraining from raising tax rates is the way to minimize outmigration from Stonebridge, while this choice does not destroy the argument, it does provide a reason to call the conclusion of the argument into question, and thus this choice is our weakener.\n\n(B) Stonebridge at present benefits from grants provided by the national government to help maintain certain parts of its infrastructure.\n\nThis choice provides some indication that Stonebridge can maintain certain parts of its infrastructure without raising tax rates. However, the conclusion of the argument is not that Stonebridge needs to raise tax rates. The conclusion is that raising taxes will have a particular effect. Therefore, this choice does not affect the argument.\n\n(C) If there is a small increase in property taxes in Stonebridge and a slightly larger proportion of total revenue than at present is allocated to infrastructure maintenance, the funding will be adequate for that purpose.\n\nA small tax increase is still a tax increase. Thus, it could still result in people moving away from Stonebridge. Therefore, this choice does not affect the dynamic that the argument uses as evidence supporting the conclusion.\n\n(D) Demographers project that the population of a region that includes Stonebridge will start to increase substantially within the next several years.\n\nThe fact that population of the region in which Stonebridge is located will “start to increase… within the next several years” does not clearly counter the idea that by raising tax rates Stonebridge will influence people to move away because:\n\n- the projected population increase may not occur until some years have passed.\n- it is not clear that a regional population increase will counteract the effects on Stonebridge’s population of a property tax rate increase.\n\nTherefore, this choice does not clearly weaken the argument.\n\n(E) The property taxes in Stonebridge are significantly lower than those in many larger cities.\n\n\nThis choice seems to present a fact that weakens the conclusion. The fact that property taxes in Stonebridge are significantly lower than those in many larger cities could be perceived as giving Stonebridge room to raise property tax rates without triggering further outmigration, because even if the government of Stonebridge were to increase the tax rates, the rates could still be lower than or equal to the rates of other cities.\n\nHowever, there are two aspects of this choice that make it such that it does not effectively weaken the argument.\n\nThe first aspect is the use of the expression “many … cities.” That Stonebridge’s tax rates are lower than those of many cities does not mean that they are lower than those of all cities or even that they are lower than those of the majority of cities. The “many cities” with higher rates could be a small percentage of the set of all cities.\n\nThe second aspect is that regardless of whether Stonebridge’s tax rates are lower than those of other cities, increasing Stonebridge’s rates would make living in Stonebridge less attractive than it is when rates are lower.\n\nTherefore, this choice does not undermine the idea that by increasing tax rates, Stonebridge would influence people to move away.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

The goal of the producer's plan is to make electric vehicles more attractive to commuters. (B) gives us a solid reason that the plan would not accomplish this goal -- maybe commuters would enjoy the ability to rent conventional cars, but that factor now has to be weighed against the increased cost of purchasing an electric vehicle.\n\nBecause the information in this answer choice would make purchasing an electric vehicle less attractive to commuters, (B) threatens the success of the producer's plan.\n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "explanation": ",\nI got your private message, and I am happy to help.   &amp; , and so I will assume that we can ignore the first three and agree that they are incorrect.  Here's the argument with the last two choices only:\n: In January of last year the Megaplex chain of movie theaters started popping its popcorn in canola oil, instead of the less healthful coconut oil that it had been using until then. Now Megaplex is planning to switch back, saying that the change has hurt popcorn sales. That claim is false, however, since according to Megaplex’s own sales figures, Megaplex sold 5% more popcorn last year than in the previous year.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the theatergoer's argument ? \nD. Total attendance at Megaplex’s movie theaters was more than 20 percent higher last year than the year before.\nE. The year before last, Megaplex experienced a 10 percent increase in popcorn sales over the previous year. of people who like a product or make some kind of purchase, and much of marketing is concerned with increasing the total traffic, increasing the raw number of people encountering the venue, because if the total number increases, the same percent will result in much higher sales.   All of web marketing is based on this principle --- increase SEO &amp; visitors to the site, and a larger number of visitors to the site will result in more sales, even though the percent of visitors who purchase remains more or less constant.   \n\nLet's think about choice .   Suppose in January, 2012, they started using the canola oil (yuck!) rather than the good saturated-fat-filled coconut oil.   We will think about ,  and let's make it a little more extreme to understand better.  Suppose in 2011, the theater had 1,000,000 visitors, and in 2012, they had 2,000,000 visitors.   Instead of a 20% increase, we'll just say that it was 100% increase, for simplicity.   If the popcorn remained absolutely unchanged 2011 until 2012, then every marketing model on Earth would predict that, in 2012, with twice the people, they would sell twice the popcorn.  Very simple.  \nNow, consider the fact that, between 2011 and 2012, in addition to twice the visitors , from 1M to 2M, the theater also made the oil change to the popcorn, as as a result, popcorn increased only 5% from 2011 to 2012.   Without changing the oil, popcorn sales would have increased 100%, just as the visitors did (at least according to any marketing model on Earth), and with the oil change, popcorn sales increased only 5% --- not good.   If sales of the item grow at any rate less than the rate of traffic increase, that necessarily means that a lower percent of total visitors want the popcorn, and the only change to which this could be attributed is the change in the oil.   \nThus, choice  indicates there's a significant problem with the use of canola oil, which gives good reason for the theater's decision to change back to coconut oil, and therefore obliterates the theater goer's argument that the theater has no good reason for changing back.  \n\nChoice  is irrelevant, because it is talking about size of popcorn sale, and we don't know anything about how the number of theater goers changed.  Continuing the dates I was using above, let's say that in 2010, the theater experienced 10% increase in popcorn sales over the sales in 2009.  Now suppose that from 2008 to 2011, the number of visitors at the theater each year remained constant.  If the same number of people are coming, and they buy 10% more in popcorn, then that means more people are buying popcorn --- that's good.  But then, in January 2012, they change the oil, and the number of visitors wildly increases, but the popcorn sales don't wildly increase --- then, that's not so good.   This is just one possible scenario, but depending on how the number of theater visitors changed from year to year is exactly what determines whether the percent change in sales is a good thing or not.   What matters the most is how the percent change in total popcorn sales compares the percentage change in total number of customers --- what we most expect is for those to change in lock-step with one another, because that would mean the percent of people buying popcorn would remain constant;  if the percent change in total popcorn sales is greater than or less than the percent change in total visitors, that indicates a change in the percent of people who buy popcorn, and that typically doesn't change too much unless there's a good reason.  We don't have enough information in  to determined whether the information given is relevant or not.   \n\nDoes all this make sense?\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)",

        "question": "Ythex has developed a small diesel engine that produces 30 percent less particulate pollution than the engine made by its main rival, Onez, now widely used in Marania; Ythex's engine is well-suited for use in the thriving warehousing businesses in Marania, although it costs more than the Onez engine. The Maranian government plans to ban within the next two years the use of diesel engines with more than 80 percent of current diesel engine particulate emissions in Marania, and Onez will probably not be able to retool its engine to reduce emissions to reach this target. So if the ban is passed, the Ythex engine ought to sell well in Marania after that time.\n\nWhich of the following is an assumption on which the argument above depends?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "E is correct IMHO, \n Ythex engine is expensive but there is nothing pushing the businesses to switch to this engine. The ban, if enforced, will ultimately mean they have to switch from their current engines. If there is another company that makes inexpensive, more popular and cleaner engines, surely the businesses will switch to that engine.\nD is close, but there is no reason to believe that difficulty in enforcing a ban doesn't mean that the ban  be enforced at some point.\n\n\nConsider the logic of the passage: Ythex's main rival is Onez. Onez's product is currently widely used and cheaper than Ythex's new product. However, if the ban is passed, the use of Onez's product will be banned.\n\nThe specific logic here is that Ythex's product ought to sell well BECAUSE the ban will eliminate Ythex's main competition. But if other manufacturer's have produced a new product that is JUST AS popular and clean-running as Ythex's product, then Ythex WILL in fact have new competition. If there would be new competition, then we cannot reason that Ythex's product ought to sell well BECAUSE the ban will elimination competition!\n\nIn other words, the argument is that Ythex's product ought to sell well when Onez's product goes away. But if other products (regardless of how many) will enter the market when Onez's product goes away, then we have no idea whether competition will increase, decrease, or stay the same. Without (E), we cannot conclude that Ythex's new product ought to sell well.\n\n\n\nHow the number of diesel engines compares to the number of other types of engines does not matter. Maybe diesel engines only represent 10% of the total engines. Regardless, \"Ythex's engine is well-suited for use in the thriving warehousing businesses in Marania.\" We don't care how sales of the new diesel engine compare to sales of other engines.\n\nIf the currently used diesel engines are banned and warehousing businesses replace the banned engines with Ythrex's new product, then Ythrex's new product ought to sell well.\n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "Proponents of the recently introduced tax on sales of new luxury boats had argued that a tax of this sort would be an equitable way to increase government revenue because the admittedly heavy tax burden would fall only on wealthy people and neither they nor anyone else would suffer any economic hardship. In fact, however, 20 percent of the workers employed by manufacturers of luxury boats have lost their jobs as a direct result of this tax.\n\nThe information given, if true, most strongly supports which of the following?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "According to the passage,\n\nBased solely on the information in the passage, we cannot assume that the government would lose any tax revenue as a result of the jobs lost by employees of luxury boat manufacturers. However, choice (B) does not necessarily say that there WILL be a tax-revenue decrease resulting from the workers' loss of jobs. Instead, choice (B) says that IF there is a tax-revenue decrease resulting from the workers' loss of jobs, the new boat tax will only produce a net gain for the government IF the revenue gained from the tax exceeds the  revenue decrease resulting from the workers' loss of jobs.\n\nIn other words, the government should see an increase in tax revenue because of the new boat tax. But what if, for whatever reason, the new boat tax causes a DECREASE in tax revenue (i.e. resulting from workers' loss of jobs)? If that decrease exceeds the increase from the boat tax, the government would actually see a net LOSS in tax revenue. Thus, statement (B) is strongly supported by the information in the passage.\n\nThe information in the passage does not necessarily support choice (D). Again, all we know is that the government should expect to receive new tax revenue from the boat tax and that 20 percent of the workers employed by manufacturers of luxury boats have lost their jobs as a result of the new boat tax.\n\nWhy did they lose their jobs? Perhaps some people who could have afforded a luxury boat without the tax could not afford a luxury boat with the tax, causing sales and, thus, production of luxury boats to decline. Regardless of whether this theory is true, we cannot assume that the people who decided not to buy luxury boats because of the tax were not wealthy. Even if we could, we would not be able to assume that luxury boats were LARGELY bought by people who were not wealthy before the tax was instituted. There is nothing in the passage to support choice (D), so it must be eliminated.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "Psychologists conducted an experiment in which half of the volunteers were asked to describe an unethical action they had performed, while the other half were asked to describe an ethical action they had performed. Some of the volunteers, chosen at random from each of the two groups, were encouraged to wash their hands afterward. Among those who described unethical actions, those who washed their hands were significantly less likely to volunteer for another, similar experiment than those who did not wash their hands. The researchers concluded that some of the subjects failed to volunteer again in part because of their having described an unethical action.\n\nWhich of the following would, if true, most help to support the researchers' conclusion?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Researchers found that some participants in the first experiment were more likely to volunteer for a second experiment.\n\nWhat led to that finding?\n.\n\nBut what does the evidence say?\n and choosing to volunteer again, but the researchers do NOT address that correlation.\n\nNow, the question becomes how we can support the conclusion that the primary issue is the ethical/unethical storytelling, NOT the hand-washing.\n\nSo, we’re looking for an answer choice that can both disentangle these two variables (hand-washing and ethical/unethical storytelling) and support the idea that describing an unethical action discouraged volunteers from volunteering again.\n\nWith that in mind, let’s take a look at the answer choices:\n\nIf (A) is true, then the likelihood volunteers choose to volunteer again appears to depend, in part, on whether they washed their hands. But even then, the researchers conclusion is about the impact of describing an unethical action, not washing hands. Eliminate (A).\n\n(B) is interesting. If the likelihood of volunteering again is higher among those who described ethical actions than those who described unethical actions, then it seems to be true that the type of action described by a volunteer has an impact on his/her choice to volunteer again. Moreover, (B) removes the second variable, hand-washing, that would otherwise influence the decision to volunteer again. So, (B) both eliminates a possible alternative explanation for the decision to volunteer again and provides support for the researchers’ explanation of the decision to volunteer again. Let’s keep (B).\n\nThe researchers’ conclusion focuses on the impact of describing an unethical action on choosing to volunteer again. Relatively little support is given for that conclusion, but even that support is not related to the choices of volunteers that washed or did not wash their hands. For that reason, (C) is irrelevant, and we can eliminate it.\n\nAgain, despite the large quantity of information given in the passage about volunteers washing their hands, that information has little to do with the researchers’ conclusion. Eliminate (D).\n\nWhile equal numbers of volunteers may have been encouraged to wash their  hands, this does nothing to support the researchers’ conclusion that describing an unethical action had an impact on volunteers’ decision to volunteer again. Eliminate (E).\n\nIn this instance, many of the answer choices described possibilities that had no direct connection to the researchers’ conclusion. For that reason, we could eliminate those choices, and (B) is correct.\n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "Sasha: It must be healthy to follow a diet high in animal proteins and fats. Human beings undoubtedly evolved to thrive on such a diet, since our prehistoric ancestors ate large amounts of meat.\n\nJamal: But our ancestors also exerted themselves intensely in order to obtain this food, whereas most human beings today are much less physically active.\n\nJamal responds to Sasha by doing which of the following?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "- Sasha makes a claim (“must be healthy” clearly indicates a claim) that following a diet high in animal proteins and fats must be healthy.\n\n - This portion supports the claim made in the first statement (The way to read any passage is to connect every idea back to the previous ones. At every statement, you should ask yourself, “How is this connected with the context so far?”)\n\n - This portion supports the idea mentioned in the initial part of the sentence. Since our prehistoric ancestors ate a lot of meat, Sasha claims, human beings evolved to thrive on such a diet. (Since human beings evolved to thrive on a diet of meat, a diet high in animal proteins and fats must be healthy.)\n\n - Jamal starts his statement with a ‘but’ that indicates he is going to oppose some aspect of Sasha’s statement. Jamal points out a difference between human beings today and our ancestors – the level of physical exertion. (How does that impact Sasha’s point? Sasha’s argument was that what worked for our ancestors should work for us. By pointing out a difference between our ancestors and us, Jamal indicates that what worked for them may not work for us).\n\nThe one glaring gap in Sasha’s argument that can be exploited in multiple ways is that she assumed that what worked for our ancestors would work for us. What if there are differences between us and our ancestors such that what worked for them may not work for us? (Jamal indicates just this.)\n\nAnother gap in Sasha’s argument is that she assumes that just because our ancestors ate that diet, it was healthy for them. It is entirely possible that our ancestors ate a lot of meat probably because they didn’t have an option, not because it was healthy for them. If meat was not even healthy for our ancestors, Sasha’s argument would be junk.\n\nWe have to find an option that tells us the way in which Jamal responds to Sasha. We have already discussed that Jamal points out a difference between us and our ancestors and thereby suggests that Sasha’s line of reasoning is not entirely correct.\n\n\n\n So, if you say that “XYZ is the best country”, qualifying your statement would mean adding exceptions or restrictions to this statement. A few examples of qualifying this statement would be:  “XYZ is the best in terms of educational standards”, “XYZ is the best if we do not include Switzerland and Poland in our consideration”, or “XYZ is the best except in October and November”.\n\nNow coming back to the option, is Jamal bringing some information that suggests that Sasha should add reservations to or exceptions to her main conclusion that it must be healthy to follow a diet high in animal proteins and fats? The answer is yes. Sasha should add a reservation by stating something like: following a diet high in animal proteins and fats must be healthy, except probably for people who work much less than our ancestors.\n\n\n\n\nWe regularly come across people who have trouble with questions, like this one, that are based on conversation. The primary difference between these conversation based questions and regular argument questions is that a regular argument generally has a unidirectional flow (a conclusion supported by some premises). On the other hand, these conversation based questions typically involve one person making the argument and then another person challenging that argument. Thus, reasoning exists both in favor and against a certain point. The challenge therefore becomes two-fold: to understand how the conclusion is supported and to understand how the conclusion (and its reasoning) is challenged.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "Fame, \nSo, the hamsters have an inherited disease, and 24 hr/day of fluorescent light helps them more than 1/2 fluorescent light and 1/2 darkness.  Something about the light promotes healing more than the darkness.  Is fluorescent light better than sunlight?  We don't know, that's not addressed.  We are exploring some connection between light (either time of light or kind of light) and healing.  \n\n \nTotal distractor.  Nothing in the prompt is about comparing different kinds of light, or about perception instead of healing.  \n\n \nThe effect of light on healing --- this is a promising one.  \n\n \nAdmittedly, this is somewhat paradoxical, given this prompt.  This one, though, is not specifically about healing, about immune function.  Also, these fish have  to live in total darkness, so presumably their response to light would be quite different from that of an animal (such as a hamster or a human) that has evolved in ordinary circadian rhythms of light.  It's not clear whether the hamster study would \"shed any light\" on how these fish survive.  \n\n \nAnother great distractor.  This has nothing about light, which is clearly the central point of the prompt.  Other inherited disease that hamsters could get ---that sounds like a huge topic, and presumable some of them would have nothing to do with exposure to light.  It's not clear that the methods of research presented in this prompt would be helpful here.  \n\n \nThe prompt was looking at how light, and availability of light, promotes healing, that is to say, immune response.   This is about plants, not animals --- a huge different biologically.  This is about what might be helpful about darkness, not light.  This concerns, not the immune system in particular, but the ordinary life-cycle of a plant.  It's not well connected to the research about hamsters.  \nI will say, though, I think this is a flaw in the question.  Technically, the question says, \"\"  Well, apart from any context, any of the science concerning healing in hamsters, the bare-bones research method of 24hr light vs. (1/2 light, 1/2 dark) would probably be exactly what you would have to use to test the hypothesis about plants needing light to bloom.  I can see whoever wrote the question did not intend for this to be the answer, but whoever wrote the question did not do a particularly good job with diction, especially in that final prompt question.  Technically, \"method of research\" could be the specific design of this experiment, which would make  a credible answer.   \n\n is clearly the answer the question authored wanted, but because the prompt was not worded well,  is also a credible answer.  I have no idea what the source of this question is, but I would say --- this is a faulty CR question.  In a well-written question, you would not have a \"loophole\" answer such as this.  \n\nThat's my 2¢\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)",

Roberto never uses pine to build his tables because he likes the heavier feel of oak and believes it is more durable. When he built Marion a dining room table he bought the wood from Joe’s Lumber, so the table must be made of oak.\n\nThe argument above is most similar in its logical structure to which one of the following?\n\n",

        "explanation": "Answer: B\n\n\nThis is a Parallel question. It asks you to look for a set of statements that follow a similar logical pattern to the one given in the passage.\n\n\nIn this case, the argument states that a lumberyard sells only two types of lumber, pine and oak, and Joe never uses pine to build tables. Thus, when he builds a table for Marion, it must be made of oak. The key word never restricts Joe’s choice.\n\n\nYou must look for a similar pattern in the answers.\n\n\nIn answer A there is no definitive “only” statement that restricts Rocky’s choice and determines the conclusion. He just makes a judgment call as to which car works for him. In answer B you see the right pattern. The Roddick Corporation offers Pedzisai only two choices, Sweden and South Africa. Pedzisai would never choose South Africa if given a choice between the two. Thus, when choosing an assignment, he will choose Sweden. The word never is used in almost exactly the same way, as a restricting factor and one that determines the concluding statement. Answer C actually sets up conditions under which Georgia will choose neither of the options at her disposal. Answer D has a conclusion that has nothing to do with the choice between the break and a longer lunch. Rather, it has to do with a third element, whether to get a haircut or not. The pattern is not the same. In answer E, the owner has equally bad choices and the conclusion gives no indication of what choice is made. Rather, it just describes the conditions regardless of what choice the owner makes, unless of course a third alternative presents itself.

        "question": "In contemplating major purchases, businesses often consider only whether there is enough money left from monthly revenues after paying monthly expenses to cover the cost of the purchase. But many expenses do not occur monthly; taking into account only monthly expenses can cause a business to overexpand. So the use of a cash-flow statement is critical for all businesses.\n\nWhich one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Ideally, when you arrived at the end of this argument you said to yourself, “Cash flow statement? What the **** is a cash flow statement? Where did that come from?!” If you are able to recognize that the term “cash flow statement” appeared nowhere else in the argument besides the conclusion, you are definitely on the right track. That’s just not a legitimate argumentative strategy on the LSAT. The concepts  connect together. If you’re going to tell me I need to have a cash flow statement, you better well provide some Goddamn evidence about why cash flow statements are necessary.\n\nHere, the evidence was only about the importance of considering longer-term expenses instead of monthly expenses. Well, let’s take Fox LSAT as an easy example. I do take into account long-term expenses (I’m not an idiot) but there is no way in hell I am going to waste my time generating a cash-flow statement every month. There are other ways to plan. Personally, I just make sure to keep some money aside for irregular/unplanned expenses. There’s no “cash flow statement” involved in keeping a little cash in reserve.\n\nWe’re asked to strengthen the argument, so I’d love an answer that protects against my objection by connecting the facts to the conclusion. Something like, “The cash flow statement is the best/only/easiest way to plan for irregular/unplanned expenses” would be a very nice answer.\n\nA) Close, but the problem stipulated in the facts isn’t monthly expenses. The problem is  expenses. We’re not worried about monthly expenses, because it’s acknowledged in the argument that many companies just pay all their monthly expenses first, then spend whatever’s left. It’s the longer-term and irregular expenses that are the issue.\n\nB) No, the point was, “Use a cash flow statement so that you  overexpand.” This answer only addresses what’s happened when you’ve already overextended yourself.\n\nC) This does not have the magic words “cash flow statement.” There is no way in hell the correct answer doesn’t include those words.\n\nD) Aha! This matches our prediction. If this is true, then a cash flow statement is the only way (i.e., it’s necessary, i.e., it’s “critical”) for tracking non-monthly expenses. (And monthly expenses as well, although that’s irrelevant.) This answer does more than we need it to, but that’s just fine if we’re trying to strengthen the argument.\n\nE) Again, this lacks the magic words “cash flow statement.”\n\nOur answer is D, because it’s the only one that plugs up the giant hole in the logic.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

What's generally wrong with those answers is that they don't hit the argument's specific plan working with the argument's specific group.  Here in this argument we don't know whether transportation workers have specific skills or qualifications that makes them more worthy of a higher raise (clearly doctors vs. minimum wage workers would expect higher increases; what about transportation workers?), so A isn't able to make a direct case that a $2/hour range is even an option for the workers in question, or that the workers in question had even been trying to negotiate for a raise (we know housing advocates were, but we don't know whether the grounds crew union was actively pushing for a raise).  In general, be wary of the maybe analogous, maybe not group or plan...do they really impact this one?\n\nAnother thing we like to say at Veritas Prep is \"the existence of a better plan doesn't weaken this plan\" in \"Weaken the Plan\" questions.  Yeah $2/hour would be a better increase than $1/hour, but why here - again, we don't know that they even asked for a raise - would you reject a raise of any kind?  B gives that reason: hey, actually that raise comes at a big cost for these people - there's a chance that they end up worse off than they were before.  When you're asked to weaken a plan, you want to show that the plan has a chance to 1) not work at all or 2) be counterproductive.  And here B shows that it would be counterproductive.  \n\nSo basically:\n\nA suggests that there might be a better plan \n\nB shows that THIS plan could be entirely counterproductive.  \n\nIn weaken-the-plan questions, the answer that shows a direct reason why THIS plan won't work in THIS situation is the right answer.",

Most young adults prefer a livelier writing style and, therefore, rarely read the Sentinel. Accordingly, we plan to adopt a livelier writing style in hopes of increasing our readership by attracting more young adult readers.\n\nThe publisher's plan assumes which of the following?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "This question is a Plan question. In many Plan questions, the conclusion is implied rather than stated. In this case, the implied conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for the conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nThe correct answer will state an assumption that the plan assumes. In other words, it will state an assumption that's necessary for the conclusion to follow logically from the evidence.\n\n\n\nThis choice is a trap. It has the vibe of being correct in that we can get the impression that it's necessary for the plan to work. After all, we might reason that, if this choice isn't true, by implementing the plan, the sentinel may lose more readers than it gets.\n\nNotice, however, that the plan could work fine even if this choice is not true. After all, for the plan to work, it doesn't have to the case that the current readers  the new writing style. As long as they like the new writing style enough to keep reading the sentinel, the plan could work. For instance, if they like the new writing style only about as much as they like the traditional writing style, the plan will work.\n\nSo, the plan doesn't assume what this choice says.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice could explain why the Sentinel has used the traditional writing style: its writers prefer to write in that style.\n\nHowever, we don't need such an explanation. We need an assumption necessary for the plan to work, and it's not necessary for the plan of using a livelier style to work for the writers to prefer to write in a traditional style.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nIf we're not clear about the exact stated outcome of the plan, we can easily fall for this incorrect choice because, in the real world, if a newspaper did something to increase readership, the purpose of doing so would likely be to increase advertising revenues.\n\nSo, we need to notice that, in this case, what we know about the plan is that its purpose is \"increasing our readership by attracting more young adult readers.\" It doesn't have to be the case that advertising revenues will increase for the plan to lead to the outcome of increasing readership.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice provides additional support for the conclusion that the Sentinel will attract more young adult readers. However, we're not looking for support for that conclusion. We're looking for an assumption necessary for the plan of changing the writing style to work.\n\nFor that plan to work, it's not necessary for the Sentinel to also take other measures. In other words, it's not necessary for the Sentinel to have other plans.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis is the assumption that we need. For the plan to work, it must be the case that, by changing the writing style, the Sentinel will attract more readers than it will lose.\n\nAfter all, if this choice isn't true and the number of current readers who will object so strongly to the new writing style that they will stop reading the Sentinel will be GREATER than the number of new readers who will be attracted, then the Sentinel will experience a decrease, rather than an increase, in readership as a result of the plan.\n\nSo, for the plan to work, this choice must be true.\n\nThe correct answer is (E).",

Noting this phenomenon, SaleCo's president plans to increase overall productivity by keeping the offices closed on Fridays and having all employees work the same schedule-ten hours a day, four days a week. \n\nWhich of the following, if true, provides the most reason to doubt that the president's plan, if implemented, will achieve its stated purpose? \n",

If anything, I would say that this information increases the probability that the plan will achieve its desired purpose i.e. the productivity of the people will increase. The employees who work 10 hrs 4 days do not do it on their own accord and according to what works best for them; instead, they do it because their supervisors told them to. Hence, their productivity is higher not because their body works best in this manner and hence they chose to work this way but because somehow, this 10 hrs 4 days schedule increased their productivity. This means that if others are also told by their supervisors to work 10 hrs 4 days, their productivity might increase too. \n\nC says that 10 hrs has allowed people to work alone for 2 hrs. This alone time increased their productivity. If everybody is made to work for 10 hrs, there will be no alone time for anyone. Hence, we would expect the productivity of current 10 hrs 4 day slot people to decrease and the productivity of the rest of the employees to stay the same.

One factor is the \"digital divide\"—those who might benefit the most from using coupons, such as homemakers, the elderly, and those in low-income households, often do not have the knowledge or equipment necessary to go online and receive coupons.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, does the most to support the claim that the digital divide is responsible for lower electronic coupon redemption rates?\n",
        "answer": "formatted",
        "explanation": "This is a strengthen critical reasoning question.  On these first develop a solid understanding of the argument, and then if possible predict what a correct answer choice would look like.\n\nThe argument here is:\n\nPremise: Redemption rate of e-mailed coupons is lower than paper coupons\nPremise: Those who might benefit the most from using coupons (homemakers, etc) often do not have the knowledge and equipment necessary to go online and receive coupons\nConclusion: The fact that those who might benefit most from using coupons don't have the resources to obtain them (the \"digital divide\") is one of the factors contributing to a lower rate of redemption for e-mailed coupons than paper coupons.\n\nAs for my prediction, I am keeping it vague and looking for some evidence that, if given easier access to these e-mailed coupons, these people would actually be more likely to redeem them.\n\nAnswer choice A - This would weaken the argument because it is belittling the idea of the digital divide by showing other resources that these people can use to obtain the coupons.  This is a trap answer, because we are trying to strengthen the argument.\n\nAnswer choice B - This strengthens the argument and is thus correct.  If some of the people discussed in the second premise, the people who would benefit most from using coupons, use an abnormally large amount of ordinary coupons then most likely they would use more e-mailed coupons if they were more readily available.\n\nAnswer choice C - The lack of resources has already been covered in the second premise, so this does not strengthen the argument.  Repeating a premise will never strengthen or weaken an argument.\n\nAnswer choice D - This is out of scope.  The difference in usage amongst different members of the group is not important.\n\nAnswer choice E - This is out of scope also.

Alas, no: the original argument doesn't specify exactly what baseline it's using when it talks about a  in the number of baby-dolphin deaths   be an increase in dolphin deaths due to cold weather in January and February relative to the couple of months immediately prior to January and February. Tough one, but get rid of it forever: we still haven't figured out the cause of these poor, fragile dolphins' deaths. has any bearing at all on what's happening in the Gulf. The argument never states that the Gulf is also a traditionally warm area, and as such, even if (D) is true, it may not explain what happened in the Gulf.

        "question": "Stockholders have been critical of the Flyna Company, a major furniture retailer, because most of Flyna's furniture is manufactured in Country X from local wood, and illegal logging is widespread there. However, Flyna has set up a certification scheme for lumber mills. It has hired a staff of auditors and forestry professionals who review documentation of the wood supply of Country X's lumber mills to ensure its legal origin, make surprise visits to mills to verify documents, and certify mills as approved sources of legally obtained lumber. Flyna uses only lumber from certified mills. Thus, Flyna's claim that its Country X wood supply is obtained legally is justified.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, would most undermine the justification provided for Flyna's claim?\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "please can you help decode this question?.\nI eliminated D based on the fact that \"Flyna uses only lumber from certified mills\". So no matter how many or how few the number of mills inspected, the ones certified are legit ones. So this statement does not seem to weaken the justification in my opinion.\n\nExperts, can you please advise? Flyna's certification scheme works:\n\nBecause this proportion is quite low (10%), this choice undermines Flyna's scheme for certification, and that scheme is the basis for Flyna's justification.\n\nIf true, Choice (D) doesn't demolish the claim. But no other answer choice does a better job of undermining the logic laid out in the passage.\n\nThat's why (D) is the best choice. I hope this helps!,\n\nI understand that the passage doesn't say that Flyna pays surprise visits to ALL mills that have submitted documents for verification. Also the passage doesn't say that Flyna ONLY certifies mills that it has surprised with a visit.\nThe above COULD mean that Flyna's staff might have given certifications to mills that haven't been surprised by visits.\nHowever, don't we have to make the above additional assumptions for D to be a valid weakener? Since all D tells us is that Flyna's staff inspects about 10 percent of ALL mills in Country X. It doesn't tell us anything about any mills that exist that are certified but haven't been paid surprise visits. That bit has to be assumed from our side for D to be valid.\nWould love to know your thoughts.\n\nRegards,\nUdit, would  provided for Flyna's claim.\n\nOne more time, here is the  of Flyna's justification:\n\n undermines the logic of Flyna's justification:\n\n. Likewise, we don't need any information about Flyna's certification rate to know, again, that 9 out of 10 lumber mills in Country X have not been inspected.\n\nFlyna's certification scheme depends inspection. The low rate of inspection, revealed by choice (D), undermines confidence in Flyna's certification scheme and consequently undermines Flyna's justification. It's the low rate of inspection itself that undermines Flyna's entire chain of logic.\n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

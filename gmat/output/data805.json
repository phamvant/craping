        "question": "In 1986, the city of Los Diablos had 20 days on which air pollution reached unhealthful amounts and a smog alert was put into effect. In early 1987, new air pollution control measures were enacted, but the city had smog alerts on 31 days that year and on 39 days the following year. In 1989, however, the number of smog alerts in Los Diablos dropped to sixteen. The main air pollutants in Los Diablos are ozone and carbon monoxide, and since 1986 the levels of both have been monitored by gas spectrography. \n\nWhich of the following statements, assuming that each is true, would be LEAST helpful in explaining the air pollution levels in Los Diablos between 1986 and 1989? \n\n",

The author extrapolates from that study to draw a conclusion about a different phenomenon: Artists generally struggle to make depictions of hands that look realistic to people because (according to the author) . The author thinks our familiarity with hands makes it hard for artists to depict hands realistically.\n\n\n \nThe author makes two assumptions: First, that the reason equestrians rated the horse art as less realistic was specifically because they were so familiar with horses. And second, the author assumes that this same phenomenon would also apply to human hands, though the study did not address hands. The right answer choice would evaluate one of these assumptions. For example, perhaps there is a reason to think hands would not be subject to the same issue, and there is another reason artists find them difficult to realistically depict—possibly they are just really hard to draw. \n\n\n\n(A) Whether expert artists were or were not included, the results of the study are the same: Familiarity with horses tends to result in rating depictions of them as less realistic. This choice does not address  this is the case or whether hands would be any different. \n\n(B) The opinion of expert artists regarding the difficulty of depicting horses compared with the difficulty of depicting human hands is irrelevant because it does not explain why the trend revealed by the study is true, nor does it address whether it is appropriate to assume something similar would occur with hands. Whether expert artists consider horses less, equally, or more difficult to depict than they do human hands, it is still the case that those who are more familiar with horses tend to rate depictions of horses as less realistic. \n\n(C) Whether the shapes and proportions of human hands are  or more varied than are the shapes and proportions of horses, the outcome is the same: It’s not clear whether hands would be subject to the same phenomenon horses are, when depicted in art. The author explicitly mentions that humans are . The question is whether such familiarity results in depictions of hands seeming less realistic to the audience. \n\n(D) It would be helpful to know if people especially familiar with human hands found depictions of them less realistic than did the general population. This would show that hands are subject to the same phenomenon horses are. But this choice does not indicate how such “hand experts” might rate artistic depictions of human hands—it’s possible that they would give the same ratings as non-hand-experts.\n\n This answer suggests a possible qualification to the general pattern established in the study. If people familiar with horses tended to rate their depictions as more accurate , the study would suggest that it is not audience familiarity on its own that tends to result in a depiction looking less realistic, but a significant gap in familiarity between artist and audience. This would weaken the critic’s claim; since all people, artists and audience alike, are said to have , such a gap in familiarity (between artist and audience) would be greatly diminished or even eliminated. There would need to be another reason that people find depictions of hands unrealistic besides people’s familiarity with their shape and proportion—perhaps hands are just very hard to draw. \n\nOn the other hand, if people familiar with horses rate their depictions as inaccurate even when the artist is also especially familiar with horses, the critic’s argument would be strengthened, as this would eliminate a possible explanation for why hands might not be subject to the phenomenon found in the study.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

The correct answer is a question which could support or weaken the conclusion depending on its answer.\n\nThe factor suggested in this answer choice is not enough to evaluate the analyst's claim, as it only represents one side of the coin - the lost customers. We do not know whether the number of gained customers is also proportionate to the number of visitors (and in what proportion), so we cannot determine whether the abundant traffic is damaging to the company or not.\n\n\nE.

        "explanation": "Original Explanation - \n\nIdentify the Question Type:\n\nThe phrase “explanation for the apparent contradiction” indicates that this is an Explain question. Expect the answer to explain how both parts of the apparent contradiction can be true at the same time.\n\nUntangle the Stimulus:\n\nThe discrepancy is that the Student Body President and the University President each cite a different survey, with seemingly contradictory results. The University President’s survey suggests overwhelming support for a store that’s not run by students, while the Student Body President’s survey indicates that students consider student-run businesses to be extremely valuable.\n\nPredict the Answer:\n\nIt’s difficult to predict an exact answer for most Explain questions, but it should be enough to realize that the correct answer will explain why students would support student-run businesses in one survey but not in the other.\n\nEvaluate the Choices:\n\n(B) is correct, providing an excellent explanation. If the Student Body President’s survey polled only prospective students, then the populations of the two surveys are completely different: prospective students in one survey and actual students in the other. And if the populations are different, then it’s no surprise that the surveys produce different results.\n\n(A) doesn't explain either opinion, let alone how both could be true. If a student-run business might make as much money as a food chain, then why would seventy-two percent of the students vote for the Hamburger Hut, in hopes of increasing the school’s revenue? And the Student Body President said the reason students want to run most stores is to get a feeling of an entrepreneurial community, not generate revenue.\n\n(C) deals with what was not asked on one of the surveys. But the fact that something was not asked doesn't, by itself, explain the apparent contradictory results of what was asked on the two surveys.\n\nIf, as (D) says, most students believe the feeling of entrepreneurial community is more important than other student services, then why would they vote to replace a student-run business with Hamburger Hut, all in order to prove more money for “other student services?”\n\n(E) casts doubt on the University President's claim that the increased school revenue from Hamburger Hut will provide more money for other students services, but does nothing to explain the apparent contradiction between the surveys. \n\nTAKEAWAY:  The answer to an Explain question must show how both parts of the apparent contradiction can be true at the same time. Watch out for choices that deal with only one part of the contradiction, or neither part.",

Establishing whether there have been partnerships or sponsorships would provide clear evidence of such targeted marketing efforts, either supporting or weakening the hypothesis.\n\nThe other options, while relevant, do not directly address the hypothesis about targeted marketing:\n\nA.

Whether there has been a historical precedent of programming languages becoming popular in specific industries due to targeted marketing efforts.\n   - Possible answer but not as good as D.

        "question": "People's supply of willpower is not infinite; psychologists have found that successfully accomplishing one task requiring self-control leads to less persistence on a second, seemingly unrelated task. But that finite supply can become larger, because, like a muscle, willpower grows with use: a recent study showed that people who followed a physical exercise program for two months reported studying more, watching less television, and doing more housework after those two months.\n\nThe reasoning above makes which of the following assumptions?\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of the argument is not clearly indicated by a keyword or by the structure of the argument. However, by considering which statement in the passage is supported by another statement, we can determine that the conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for that conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nThe correct answer to the question must state an assumption that the argument makes in using that evidence to support the conclusion.\n\n\n\nNotice that, regardless of whether studying, watching television, and doing housework should be considered unrelated tasks, it is still the case that, after following a physical exercise program for two months, the study participants reported doing more studying and housework and less television watching. In other words, after following an exercise program, the participants demonstrated increased willpower.\n\nSo, the evidence provided appears to support the conclusion regardless of whether this choice is assumed.\n\n\n\nNotice that, regardless of whether the people in the study watched less television than the average person before the study took place., it is still the case that, after following a physical exercise program for two months, the study participants reported watching less television than they watched before. In other words, the participants demonstrated increased willpower.\n\nSo, the evidence provided appears to support the conclusion  regardless of whether this choice is assumed.\n\n\n\nThe argument is simply that \"willpower grows with use.\"\n\nThat conclusion could be true and could follow from the evidence even if people's supply of willpower CAN be increased by means other than repeatedly exercising that willpower, in other words, in a different way. After all, it's possible for a goal to be accomplishable in two different ways.\n\nSo, the argument doesn't assume what this choice says.\n\n\n\nThe evidence used to support the conclusion that people's finite supply of willpower can become larger, because, like a muscle, willpower grows with use is the fact that \"people who followed a physical exercise program for two months reported studying more, watching less television, and doing more housework after those two months.\"\n\nHonestly, the argument is not that tightly constructed. It's not 100 percent clear what the relationship between exercise and using willpower is.\n\nAlso, how this choice figures into the argument is not 100 percent clear. Does a person really have to use  willpower to exercise use of willpower?\n\nAt the same time, it seems clear that the fact that people followed a physical exercise program for two months does not mean that they exercised use of willpower. After all, it could be the case that those people didn't need to use willpower to exercise. Maybe they just liked exercising, or maybe they were  accustomed to exercising and thus didn't need much willpower to exercise.\n\nSo, this choice seems to be a good candidate because it provides some confirmation that, in exercising, people did exercise use of will power and thus could have developed more willpower that supported their studying more, watching less television, and doing more housework.\n\n\n\nThis choice is hard to eliminate. After all, it seems to confirm that people did indeed develop more willpower by exercising for two months and that it is for that reason that they \"reported studying more, watching less television, and doing more housework.\"\n\nHowever, I think we can eliminate this choice because the evidence that they reported studying more, watching less television, and doing more housework is sufficient on its own to indicate that they developed more willpower. We don't need the additional evidence that, prior to the study, they had  to demonstrate more self-control over their studying, television watching, or housework. After all, they did study more, watch less television, and do more housework. So, it's clear that something did change.\n\nSo, while this question was a close call for me, I think we can safely chose",

        "question": "Psychologist: In an experiment, volunteers were asked to solve abstract arithmetic problems while their brains were being scanned. The brain scans revealed considerable activity in the linguistic-processing centers of the brain. However, it is likely that this activity reflected passing thoughts that are not an indispensable part of arithmetical reasoning processes.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, provides the strongest justification for the psychologist's judgment?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "The passage presents the following conclusion:\n\n\n\nNo evidence for the conclusion is provided.\n\n\n\nThe question asks which choice \"provides the strongest justification for the psychologist's judgment.\" Since \"the psychologist's judgment\" is another way of saying \"the conclusion,\" the correct answer will be evidence that supports the conclusion.\n\n\n\nThis choice weakens, rather than strengthens, the case for the conclusion.\n\nAfter all, if this choice is true, then the activity in the linguistic-processing (language-processing) centers of the brain may not have \"reflected passing thoughts that are not an indispensable part of arithmetical reasoning processes,\" but rather reflected thoughts that were an important part of the arithmetical reasoning processes of these volunteers.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice could be taken as slightly strengthening the argument. After all, by confirming that there was activity in other parts of the brain, this choice shows that it's possible that the activity in the linguistic-processing centers was not reflective of an indispensable part of the arithmetical reasoning process.\n\nAfter all, if there were not activity in other parts of the brain, then the activity in the linguistic-processing centers would have been the only activity occurring when the volunteers were solving the problems, meaning that it was almost certainly indispensable to the arithmetical reasoning process.\n\nAt the same time, this choice may not be correct because the idea that there would be a situation in which there was activity in only one area of the brains of volunteers solving problems isn't really realistic since there would have to be some activity in different parts of people's brains if their brains were functioning normally. So, my guess is that  the question-writer didn't consider that situation realistic and thus didn't figure the idea of that situation into the reasoning about this choice.\n\nIn addition, it's a good bet that the question-writer was looking for something that more clearly shows that the activity in the linguistic-processing centers was not indispensable to the mathematical reasoning process than this choice does.\n\nSo, I think GMAC made a mistake including this choice since it does strengthen the argument in a way, but I'm not expecting it to be the correct answer.\n\nKeep for now, but expect to find a better choice.\n\n\n\nWe could get the impression that this choice strengthens the argument by showing that activity in the linguistic-processing centers of the brain is involved in \"mental tasks other than arithmetic\" and that therefore any activity in those centers is not related to doing arithmetic.\n\nHowever, the truth is that the fact that some activity that occurs in the linguistic-processing centers is not related to doing arithmetic does not mean that all activity that occurs in those centers is not related to doing arithmetic.\n\nAfter all, it's possible that the linguistic-processing centers handle a variety of types of tasks. So, while some activity in the linguistic processing centers may not be arithmetic related, other activity in those centers could be essential to doing arithmetic.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice provides no clear information about linguistic-processing centers since it doesn't say anything about how the injuries affected or did not affect the people's brains.\n\nIf it said that people were capable of solving arithmetic problems after injuries to their linguistic-processing centers, then it might strengthen the argument, but it doesn't say anything that specific about the head injuries.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice provides some clear support for the conclusion that it is likely that the activity in the linguistic-processing centers reflected passing thoughts that are not an indispensable part of arithmetical reasoning processes. After all, if professional mathematicians can solve the problems without such activity occurring, then we can see that that activity is not reflective of an \"indispensable,\" meaning \"necessary,\" part of arithmetical reasoning processes.\n\nThe correct answer is (E).",

        "question": "Economist: On average, returns are higher on stocks than on bonds, as one would expect: higher average returns are a necessary incentive for investors to accept the greater risks of loss that come with stock investments. However, the average difference in returns between stocks and bonds is even greater than one would expect based on risk alone. Financial planners may be responsible. Their pay depends mainly on avoiding losses for their clients, which encourages them to recommend safe investments with low returns. This increased demand for bonds increases their price and hence decreases their potential return. \n\nWhich of the following is an assumption the economist’s argument requires?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The economist concludes the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for that conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe correct answer must be something the economist has assumed in going from the evidence about financial planners recommending safe investments to the conclusion about financial planners possibly being responsible for the larger than expected difference between the returns on stocks and bonds.\n\n\n\nThe support for the conclusion does not depend on any financial planners recommending that their clients invest  in bonds. As long as they gravitate toward recommending bonds and recommend them more than they would if they were not emphasizing avoiding losses, the argument works.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe passage states as fact that the \"average\" difference between stock and bond returns is greater than would be expected.\n\nThis information about what is justified with regard to investing in \"a specific stock\" is not necessary for the argument to work since it is not necessary to support a fact with an assumption.\n\nAlso, the author's general statement about the overall \"average\" difference would not be supported by this statement about a specific stock in any case.\n\nEliminate. \n\n\n\nHonestly, I don't consider this choice an assumption. The author states as fact that \"This increased demand for bonds increases their price and hence decreases their potential return.\"\n\nIf financial planners are gravitating toward recommending bonds because they are risk averse and thus are causing the difference between stock and bond returns to be greater than expected, then we can infer that, as this choice says, \"On average, financial planners recommend less investment in stocks than the returns on such investments would justify for their clients.\" After all, if they are unduly bidding up bonds, then they are also unduly staying away from stocks.\n\nSo, I think this choice is more of an inference based on what the passage says than an assumption.\n\nAlso, we don't need to assume this choice for the argument to work. After all, if financial planners are indeed playing it safe and recommending bonds to their clients and thus causing extra demand for bonds, then it follows that they are responsible for the greater than expected difference between the returns on bonds and the returns on stocks, regardless of whether anything is assumed about stocks.\n\nIn other words, we need only the statements about bonds for the argument to work. We don't need to assume anything about stocks. After all, the fact that there is extra demand for bonds could alone explain the greater than expected difference between bond returns and stock returns.\n\nAt the same time, none of the other choices work, and it's true that, for the statements in the passage to be true, this choice must be true as well. In other words, while this choice is not a necessary assumption, it does fit the scenario in such a way that if it's not true, then the conclusion cannot be correct. After all, if something that can be inferred from the statements in the passage is not true, then those statements cannot be true either.\n\nSo, we have to roll with this choice as the correct answer even though the argument works even if this choice is not assumed.\n\nKeep\n\n\n\nThis choice is contrary to what the passage says.\n\nAfter all, the conclusion of the argument and the support for the conclusion are basically an explanation for why bond returns are even  relative to stock returns than would be expected, not  than is justified.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe point of the argument is basically that financial planners make the difference between bond returns and stock returns greater than expected by avoiding losing money for clients by .\n\nWe can see that, to argue that point, it is certainly not necessary to assume that financial planners .\n\nEliminate.\n\n C",

        "explanation": "Medical research findings are customarily not made public prior to their publication in a medical journal that has had them reviewed by a panel of experts in a process called peer review. It is claimed that this practice delays public access to potentially beneficial information that, in extreme instances, could save lives. Yet prepublication peer review is the only way to prevent erroneous and therefore potentially harmful information from reaching a public that is ill equipped to evaluate medical claims on its own. Therefore, waiting until a medical journal has published the research findings that have passed peer review is the price that must be paid to protect the public from making decisions based on possibly substandard research.\n\nThis is an assumption question, so we need to look at the conclusion and premises once again.\n\nConclusion: Medical journal peer review is only way people can avoid bad research.\nPremises: Research subject to peer review before publication in journals, to be sure false research doesn't get out\n\n\n\n(B) anyone who does not serve on medical review panel does not have the necessary knowledge and expertise to evaluate medical research finding\nPROBLEM: This is tempting because the passage says something close to it.

Let's try the not test: \"All medical research findings are NOT subjected to prepublication peer review.\" But couldn't that be because they aren't published at all? We don't need ALL medical research findings to get the review, just the stuff that might get out to the public.\n\n(E) peer review panels are sometimes subject to political and professional pressures that can make their judgments less than impartial\nPROBLEM: This hurts our argument, because we want people on the peer review panels to be protecting the public.",

To install the machines this week, we must pay workers overtime—for which there is no money.\n\n We can contract for sweatshirts instead of dress shirts. The contract will be as profitable but can be started two weeks later—that way we can avoid any overtime work.\n\nSince the correct answer must state something that must be true for the plan to succeed, this question is a type of Assumption question. So, we can handle it as an Assumption question and look for a choice such that, if it's not true, the plan won't succeed.\n\n\n\nThis choice does not have to be true for the plan to succeed since they didn't say that they would rely on the workers who sew to install the machines.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice does not have to be true for the plan to succeed.\n\nThe accountant mentions installing new sewing machines \"this week.\"\n\nThen, as discussed above, the executive says that, by contracting for sweatshirts instead of dress shirts, they can start to make shirts \"two weeks later.\"\n\n\"Two weeks later\" than \"this week\" is not \"next week.\" Rather, two weeks later than this week is the week after next week.\n\nSo, the executive's plan does not involve installing the new machines \"by the end of next week.\" It involves installing them by the week after next week.\n\nThus, the plan can work even if it's NOT true that the new machines can be installed by the end of next week without overtime work. \n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is tricky because we could get the impression that, since they don't mention overtime in discussing the contracts, they're not concerned with overtime involved in completing the contracts.\n\nAt the same time, none of the other choices work. So, this is the only possible answer.\n\nSo, we can go back to the passage to confirm that they don't say anything about the jacket contract that indicates that this choice doesn't have to be true for the plan to succeed.\n\nDoing so, we that the accountant says the following about the jacket contract:\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the executive says nothing about the jacket contract.\n\nThus, when the executive says, \"that way we can avoid any overtime work,\" the executive must be assuming that the contracts, including the jacket contract, can be completed without any overtime work. After all, if this choice is not true, then even if the machines are installed without overtime work, they'll still end up with overtime work.\n\nSo, we can see that, for the plan to succeed, it must be true that the jacket contract can be completed on time without any overtime work.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThis choice doesn't have to be true for the plan to succeed since the way the plan succeeds is by pushing back when they need to start working on shirts, not by having the workers sew faster.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe executive states as fact that the sweatshirt contract can be started two weeks later. In doing so, the executive must be taking into account how long it takes to make a sweatshirt. So, there's no reason to believe that it must be true that a sweatshirt does not take longer to sew because, even if it does, the sweatshirt contract can be started later, apparently.\n\nEliminate.\n\n C­",

Hence, Alaska has vaccinated more people than has any other state. Note, the vaccine is a single-shot vaccine, and a state is only allowed to vaccinate its residents.\nWhich of the following is required for the assertion above to be true?",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A lot of moving parts to this question. Let's try to understand the facts presented -\n\n\nAnswer choice elimination -\n\nLet's start with Option B\n\n\n\nThis option is out of scope and relies on common knowledge. The passage doesn't share the reason for vaccination. Was the reason to get vaccinated sheer willingness or the residents were incentivized or something else, we have no idea. We can eliminate this option. \n\n\n\n% of people vaccinated = # of residents vaccinated / total number of residents. \n\nFrom the premise, we know that the value of the numerator is highest for Alaska. This statement presents us with the rate of people vaccinated between the two states. \n\nMultiple possibilities exist for this observation -\n\n1) Population of Alaska is lower than the population of California \n2) Number of people vaccinated is lower in California and the population is the same as that of Alaska.\n3) Number of people vaccinated is lower in California and the population is more than that of Alaska.\n\nHence, we can eliminate this possibility. \n\n  ranks behind Alaska in the proportion of people vaccinated, does not have a higher population.\n\n \n\nThis may be true. However, we cannot this must not be true for the statements to hold true. It's well possible that all states share the same population and the number of people vaccinated in Alaksa was greater than that of the other states. \n\nHence, we can eliminate this possibility. \n\n\n\nNot relevant. Hence, we can eliminate this option.\n\n\n\nWe know while Alaska used a greater number of vaccines than other states did, however, it ranked quite lower than most other states in vaccine administration. Let's revisit the formula again\n\n% of vaccines used = number of vaccines used (equals to the number of residents vaccinated)  / total number of vaccines that the state has received. \n\nThe numerator is highest for Alaska and the % of vaccines used is lower than most other states (as Alaska ranks 46th). This observation is possible when the value of the denominator is higher. Hence, the state must have received more supplies of vaccines than most other states. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

In light of this research, a federal law has been proposed to mandate a 32-inch minimum distance between seats.

Say, they identified 20 wasteful projects. 12 from the President's districts and 8 from the opposition's. What if the President chose all the projects to be canceled from the 8 wasteful projects of the opposition's districts? Everything said in the argument stays true but the conclusion becomes invalid.

The argument simply doesn’t make sense unless companies think people who are interested in improving their intellects are not concerned with financial gain. Otherwise, why the hell would companies discriminate against people with doctorates in the liberal arts?\n\nA) In order to strengthen the argument, I’m looking for something that connects the concepts of “interested in improving intellect” and “not interested in money.” This doesn’t do that. In fact, if this were true, I think this would hurt the argument rather than help it. It’s out.\n\nB) This isn’t quite strong enough. If “some people” interested in liberal arts don’t care about money, businesses could still hire the liberal arts students who do.\n\nC) This answer says that if Joe is not interested in making money, then we know Joe has to be interested in improving his intellect (because the “only” people not interested in making money in the business world are those who are interested in improving their intellect). But this leaves open the possibility that there are other people out there who are interested in improving their intellect who are  interested in making money. And if that’s true, then the companies should still consider hiring them. This links the correct elements together, but in the wrong order. Still looking.\n\nD) This doesn’t explain anything about why companies are doing what they’re doing. No way.\n\nE) This answer says if Joe is interested in improving his intellect, then we know he is  concerned with making money. This answer has the correct elements (like C) in the correct order (unlike C).\n\nE is our answer.\n\nNote: For most students (those not yet scoring above 170, which means almost all of you), what you really want to do here is be able to narrow down the correct answer to either C or E, then guess. It’s very difficult to understand, or even explain, the difference between C and E, and some students simply won’t read well enough to ever reach this understanding.

He does not say that it is sufficient to increase fees.\n\n(D) there is no additional explanation for the university’s shrinking applicant pool\nAgain, this is not implied. He talks about one possible explanation. Also, he talks about the NEED to increase fees. He does not imply that no other factor is playing any role.\n\n(E) the amount charged by the university for tuition has not increased in recent years\nNote that the comparison is between this school fees and other schools' fees. The fees could be rising but the fees of all schools could be rising. So comparatively, this school could be charging less than other schools all across the many years.\nSay this schools charged $20k while other schools charged $50k 5 years ago. Even if all schools are raising their fees by 10% every year, this school will continue to charge less than all other schools. \n\nAnswer (A)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

So, we're looking for an answer that is required to be true, in order for the conclusion to have a chance of being true.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is that one can tell how quickly a new idea is taking hold by by monitoring how how fast the word is passing into common usage. The problem with this is that the idea may no longer be represented in the word by the time it becomes common. The meaning of the word could have shifted and so the idea is not taking hold in society, even though the word is. This is best expressed in answer choice (D). Negating answer choice (D) would say, \"As the word passes into common usage, it's meaning does undergo severe distortions in the process.\" The meaning of the word would no longer be the same, so tracking the word, would not be tracking the idea.\n\n(A) is not necessary. They could be interested in words that are rarely used, but that doesn't mean that the editors would in their professional opinions claim that the words had passed into common usage.\n(B) is not necessary. How the editors determine whether the word has passed into common usage is not important.\n(C) is backwards. it's not that the editors must include the word in their dictionaries for the word to take hold, but that once it takes hold, it gets included in the dictionary.\n(D) is necessary to for using the common usage of a word to determine whether a new idea is taking hold in society.\n(E) would tend to weaken the argument, so is not necessary to it.

        "question": "The arousal of anger is sometimes a legitimate artistic aim, and every legitimate artwork that has this aim calls intentionally for concrete intervention in the world. Even granting that most art is concerned with beauty in some way, it follows that those critics who maintain that a concern for beauty is a characteristic of all legitimate art are mistaken. \n\nThe conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? \n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "I'll give it a shot:\n\nThe prompt says that All legitimate work of art that has arousal of anger in it calls for intervention.\n\nThe key to answering the question is to understand what this statement means. Its a classic if-then clause.. If its legitimate work of art that has anger, the art calls for intervention. This is sufficient condition. Also, we can conclude that if the art does not call for an intervention, it is not a legitimate work of art involving anger. Note that the author has mentioned that anger is sometimes a legitimate work of art.\n\nFrom here the author goes on to saying that critics who consider beauty a characteristic for  legitimate work of art are mistaken.  Essentially, the critics are saying that it is necessary for a legitimate art to contain beauty. --&gt; anything that does not contain beauty is not a legitimate work of art. \n\nHence, there is a logical gap in the reasoning. The two statements seem to contradict. Hence, we need to reconcile legitimate work of art with beauty and anger. Note that author does agree that most artwork has element of beauty in it.\n\nGoing to answer choices:\n\n(A) So what? How does this address conclusion that critics are mistaken? This is twisting the necessary condition. The author nowhere states that beauty is sufficient to consider it a legitimate work of art. This does not address the conclusion.\n\n(B) This infact strengthens critics' reasoning and weakens the conclusion, rendering author's premise useless. Additionally, use of work \"exclusively\" is too far and becomes out of scope of the passage. Whichever way you see it, this statement is wrong.\n\n(C) This is again mixing key words and presenting with a trap answer choice. This is actually irrelevant. Everything that calls for an intervention may not be a legitimate work of art. Looking from a different perspective, if it is a legitimate work of art, it still has some element of beauty. Note that its just mentioned that beauty is considered a characteristic. Not matter how irrelevant, critics can still argue that they are right. This is just so wrong at so many level. Would like to see how others are looking at this choice and eliminating it.\n\n(D) Right! Author has to assume that these works of art are not concerned with beauty. Hence the critics can be mistaken. On the other side, if there was some element of beauty, critics would be right and hence our conclusion would not hold true.\n\n(E) Wrong. This is reversal of causal relationship.\n\nNegation technique has caused me more harm in tough questions that contain multiple clauses.

        "question": "­Politician: Requiring city residents to pay taxes to subsidize the city's public transportation system is not at all unfair, even if they do not all personally use public transportation. Because public transportation allows many people to avoid driving, fewer cars are on the road. This means cleaner air and less traffic congestion, which benefit all city residents.\n\nWhich of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the politician's argument to be properly drawn?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The politician has concluded the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for the conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nWe see that the politician's reasoning is that, because public transportation results in benefits to all city residents, requiring city residents who don't use public transportation to pay taxes to subsidize the city's public transportation system is fair.\n\n\n\nThis is an Assumption question, and the correct answer will be a statement that must be true for the premises of the argument to effectively support the conclusion.\n\n\n\nThis choice is exactly what we need.\n\nThe support for the conclusion is basically that public transportation benefits all city residents.\n\nThe conclusion is \"Requiring city residents to pay taxes to subsidize the city's public transportation system is not at all unfair, even if they do not all personally use public transportation.\"\n\nWe see that the argument jumps from saying that public transportation benefits everyone to concluding that it's therefore fair to tax everyone to support it. For the evidence to support the conclusion, benefits everyone must be connected to fair to tax everyone.\n\nFor that connection to work, it must be true that it is fair to require everyone who benefits from public transportation to pay taxes to subsidize it.\n\nAfter all, if it were NOT fair to require everyone who benefits from public transportation to pay taxes to subsidize it, then the argument wouldnt work. After all, in that case, the fact that everyone benefits from public transportation would not mean that it's fair to require everyone to pay taxes to subsidize it.\n\nThus, this choice is necessary for the conclusion to be properly drawn from the premises.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThis choice is a little hard to eliminate because, if it's true, then the case for the conclusion is a little more convincing. After all, if people who use public transportation do not derive significant benefits from others' use of private transportation but, as the passage suggests, people who use private transportation do derive significant benefits from others' use of public transportation, then taxing private transportation users to subsidize public transportation seems fair because it appears to balance things out in a way.\n\nAt the same time, we can eliminate this choice because we aren't looking for something that makes the argument more convincing. We need a choice that's necessary for the argument to work, and this choice isn't necessary.\n\nAfter all, even if people who use public transportation  derive significant benefits from others' use of private transportation, it could still be fair to tax those who don't use public transportation if they benefit from it.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is not necessary for the argument to work.\n\nAfter all, even if nobody living outside the city limits uses the city's public transportation system, it could be fair to tax residents of the city who don't use it but benefit from it.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is a little tricky to eliminate because that fact that, for most city residents, the main benefit of public transportation is cleaner air and less traffic congestion could be seen as indicating that much of the reason why public tranportation exists is to enable city residents to experience cleaner air and less traffic congestion. Of course, in that case, it could be fair to tax everyone to subsidize public transportation because it could be that it exists to enable everyone to live in better condtions.\n\nHere's the thing though.\n\nWhile this choice may seem to make the case for the conclusion more convincing, this choice is not the correct answer because it's not necessary for the argument to work.\n\nAfter all, even if cleaner air and less traffic congestion is not  benefit of public transportation, it is still  benefit of public transportation. So, since people who don't use public transportation experience that benefit, even if it's not the main benefit, it could still be fair to tax them to subsidize public transportation.\n\nThus, the argument works even if this choice is not true.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is tempting because it makes sense.\n\nWe don't need a choice that just makes sense though. We need a choice that is necessary for the argument to work, and this choice isn't necessary.\n\nAfter all, even if there are no factors other than fairness that a city should consider before imposing a proposed tax, it could still be fair to nonusers of public transportation to subsidize it.\n\nEliminate.\n\n A­",

Schools that offer drug use awareness classes have experienced significant reductions in drug use by students. If by incorporating drug use awareness classes into the curriculum at Longview Prep we can reduce drug use, we can increase the averages of Longview Prep students' state-issued test scores to the levels at which they were five years ago.\n\nWhich of the following is an assumption on which the board member's conclusion depends?\n",

The other is noticing that one answer challenges an assumption that the board member made, that the average of the students' scores on state-issued tests has decreased because of increased drug use.\n\nHere's the conclusion. If by incorporating drug use awareness classes into the curriculum at Longview Prep we can reduce drug use, we can increase the averages of Longview Prep students' state-issued test scores to the levels at which they were five years ago.\n\n(A) Students who use drugs the most will not leave Longview Prep and enroll in other schools because they prefer not to attend drug use awareness classes.\n\nWhile students leaving the school to avoid the classes may somehow seem to hinder the success of the plan, the truth is that if drug use is truly connected to lower test scores, then if the students who use drugs the most were to choose to leave Longview Prep, the averages of Longview Prep students' test scores should increase.\n\n(B) Longview Prep has not over the past five years changed its curriculum by shifting its primary focus from imparting knowledge to the development of critical thinking and research skills.\n\nThe board member has assumed that the reason for the lower scores is increased drug use. In other words, the board member has assumed that scores have not declined for some other reason, such as that the school has changed its curriculum in such a way that the curriculum does not match what the state-issued tests test to the degree that the curriculum had in the past. If the students are learning via the use of a new curriculum primarily focused on the development of critical thinking skills, then likely what they are learning is not as applicable to answering questions that appear in state-issued tests of general knowledge than what the students were learning before was.\n\n(C) Longview Prep students who use drugs are not able to hide their use of drugs from teachers and administrators at Longview Prep.\n\nThis answer could trap the test taker if the test taker somehow makes an unfounded assumption about a need for signs of drug use to be evident in order for the plan to work.\n\n(D) Test focused review sessions would not be effective in increasing Longview Prep students' state-issued test scores.\n\nThe board member's argument does not depend on the assumption that there are not other ways to increase the scores. One way a test taker might choose this answer is by going beyond what can logically be inferred from what is discussed in the prompt.\n\n(E) Most students who use drugs will not eventually reduce their drug use on their own, without having taken drug use awareness classes.\n\nIf the test taker is not clear about what's going on in the argument, this answer might be tempting, but the fact that students might eventually reduce drug use on their own does not somehow make drug use awareness classes less effective.\n\nThe correct answer is B.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "explanation": "Hey All,\n\nEven though the right answer was eventually arrived at here, there was enough confusion I thought it might be worth outlining. Let's do it.\n\nEvery year many people become ill because of airborne mold spores in their homes. After someone becomes ill, specialists are often hired to eradicate the mold. These specialists look in damp areas of the house, since mold is almost always found in places where there is substantial moisture. If one wishes to avoid mold poisoning, then, one should make sure to keep all internal plumbing in good condition to prevent leakage that could serve as a breeding ground for mold.\n\nConclusion: To avoid mold poisoning, keep plumbing in good condition.\nPremises: Specialists check in damp areas of the house/mold is almost always in moist places\nAssumption: Plumbing is the only thing that causes moisture.\n\nNow I swear on a stack of bibles I wrote this assumption before looking at the answer choices. Think about it. The argument is airtight, other than this little issue. The conclusion involves plumbing, but that seems pretty specific, doesn't it? What about fixing the roof, so rain water can't get in? Truth is, there are plenty of ways moisture could get into the house.\n\nAs for a pattern, this is an eliminate alternate cause question. These are very common on the GMAT CR section, and there's a great thing to know about them: very often, when the question posits that A causes B, the assumption is that B doesn't cause A. It's called a causation/correlation mistake (we see two things happening, for example moisture and mold, and assume that moisture causes mold). Though sometimes the answer will just be any other old cause (like the leaky roof I suggested), very often it's just a reversal (mold might cause moisture). Be on the lookout!\n\n1]Mold itself does not create moisture.\nANSWER: Uh-oh. Think about it. If mold DID create moisture,  then it wouldn't be enough to check the plumbing, because the mold could be anywhere. This would explain why it's always found in moist places.\n\n2]Most homeowners know enough about plumbing to determine whether theirs is in good condition.\nPROBLEM: This is a tricky one. If the conclusion were, \"Homeowners should thus have no problem finding mold on their own,\" this would be the assumption. But the conclusion is that plumbing needs to be kept in good condition. If you don't know, you'd just have to learn.\n\n3]Mold cannot grow in dry areas.\nPROBLEM: We don't need to assume this, because the conclusion is not that all mold will be eradicated if plumbing is checked. It's only that if one wishes to avoid mold, one should keep plumbing in check. Even if mold can grow in dry places, the facts point towards moisture being the most common place to find it, and thus the conclusion would still hold.\n\n4]No varieties of mold are harmless.\nPROBLEM: Not the issue. Even if some are harmless, some aren't.\n\n5]Mold spores cannot be filtered from the air.\nPROBLEM: This might suggest another way that mold poisoning can be avoided (some type of filtration system), but as the conclusion relates to actually getting rid of the mold where it comes from, this answer choice is out of scope.\n\nHope that helps!\n\n-t",

What is that weakener? The weakener is that people acquainted with staff of the agency were allocated disproportionate number of babies.\n\nIn other words, the argument is saying that the decisions are guided solely by the best interest of children (and not whether the person is a personal acquaintance of staff member). So, for example, if it is shown that 100 personal acquaintances and 50 other people for the adoption process and more than 2/3rd of the children were placed with personal acquaintances, it would show a disproportionate allocation and weaken the argument that the process did not favor personal acquaintances. \n\nWe know from the passage that 8 of the last 10 babies  have been placed with personal acquaintances, therefore in order to defend our argument of impartiality, we need to assume that around 80% of the people who applied for adoption were personal acquaintances.

The plan is to  interest rates, not to lower them. And we already know from the passage that \"higher interest rates tend to reduce businesses' investment spending.\" So (A) isn't really giving us anything new -- it's just telling us that lower rates encourage investing, which we could already infer from the passage.\n\n(A) doesn't give us anything to explain why the trade surplus will widen, so eliminate (A).\n\nWe know from the argument that businesses will reduce investment spending. (B) tells us that this will DECREASE exports. That would actually make the trade surplus more narrow, rather than wider.\n\n(B) implies the opposite of the thing we're trying to explain, so (B) is out.\n\nThe goal of the plan is to  inflation. (C) tells us what would happen if there IS inflation, or in other words, what could happen if Country X DOESN'T implement the plan. Consumers would buy less stuff -- stuff that could potentially be imported. This could widen the trade surplus.\n\nWe're trying to explain why implementing the plan could cause a wider trade surplus. (C) gives us a reason why NOT implementing the plan could cause a wider trade surplus. This is basically the opposite of what we need in an answer choice.\n\n(C) is out.\n\nWe know from the argument that businesses will reduce their investment spending when the plan is implemented.

The point is not to compare colored paper of various textures with paint of various textures. Rather, the point made by the passage is that paint is not as good as colored paper because it is difficult to achieve the same texture in multiple uses of paint. So, the different textures point is about an issue with paint, and is not meant to be taken as indicating that different textures of colored paper would be employed.\n\nNotice that the first premise says that colored paper \"readily permits a repeated use of exactly the same color in different compositions, which ALLOWS FOR A PRECISE COMPARISON OF THAT COLOR'S IMPACT in varying contexts. Given that information, we don't need further information indicating that pieces colored paper of different textures would have the same effect.\n\n\n\nWhat choice (D) expresses is an assumption necessary for connecting the evidence to the conclusion because, in order for there to be an advantage to using colored paper to teach students about the use of color, the precise comparison of that color’s impact in varying contexts has to actually help students learn about use of color. If it did not help, then the preciseness allowed through the use of colored paper would be of no value, and so the evidence would provide no support for the conclusion.\n\nThe correct answer is (D).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

When the moisture is released, it results in heavy rains following drought periods.

(this is a quick answer in your own words). The actual assumption is: high temperatures caused the weather patterns in both Pliocene Epoch and current time periods. Because correlation does not prove causation. The assumption that the same conditions/causes apply now as in the past is critical for validating the climatologists' claim that similar weather patterns (effect) indicate similar causes—namely, climate change driven by global temperature rises.\n_______________________________\n\n\n\nThis is the opposite of what we are looking for. B) tells us that global temperatures did not influence the weather patterns in Pliocene Epoch. Eliminate\n\n\n\nFirst of all, this answer choice is an evaluation of an argument rather than an assumption. Second, there is no evidence provided or requested in the augment. The argument does not doubt or require proof of temperatures thus this cannot be the assumption. Is it possible to turn this answer choice into a valid assumption? Yes, a weak one but valid nevertheless. An example of a secondary and valid assumption would have been something such as “The increased global temperatures have been measured correctly and there is undeniable proof of rising temperatures”. This could be a weak assumption if we modify this answer choice. Other similarly weak assumptions could be that no mistakes were made in recording weather patterns, and that data was collected accurately, etc, but all of them are not at the center of the argument and not what usually be the answer on the GMAT. Eliminate.\n\nD. If global temperatures continue to rise, the frequency and severity of these weather patterns will certainly increase.\n\nThis is a predictive statement (inference) about future conditions and does not necessarily underpin the argument that current patterns are due to climate change; it’s stating implications of ongoing changes. Eliminate.\n\nE. The mechanisms that caused climate change in the past are fundamentally different from those causing current climate change.\n\nThis answer choice contradicts our argument and information given in the premise.

It assumes that remaining an effective advertising vehicle is MORE important that favourable mention of products in articles. It is putting forth the argument that since effectiveness as advertising vehicle will be lost, there will be an  overall loss to advertisers. So it is assuming that the gain by the favourable mention of products will be less than the loss by not remaining an effective advertising vehicle. \nThis is option (C)\n\nComing to option (B): The magazine cannot give any favorable mention in its articles to its regular advertisers without compromising its reputation for editorial integrity.\nAs given, option (B) is far too generic. \"Any favourable mention to advertisers\" and \"favorable mention to their products in our articles\" are different things.

        "explanation": ", but it finds itself more and more in the position of selecting from a critically depleted pool of candidates. The program is thus beginning to work against Hachnut's interest. Therefore, \n\nIn the argument given, the two boldfaced portions play which of the following roles?\n\nMany people choose this choice, and there are multiple reasons why.\n\nOne is that the second portion of this choice is correct since the second boldface portion does state the main conclusion of the argument.\n\nAnother is that the first boldface portion does describe a practice.\n\nHowever, what we need to notice to eliminate this choice is that it is not the case that the argument \"seeks to justify\" the practice of using performance during the program as a criterion in deciding among candidates. The argument simply mentions that practice as a reason to continue the management education program without seeking to justify that practice.\n\nSo, \"seeks to justify\" in this choice is a failure point.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nAs discussed in the explanation for choice (A), the first part of this choice is incorrect since the passage does not seek to justify the practice described by the first boldface portion.\n\nAlso, the second part of this choice is incorrect because the second boldface portion does not identify a standard that a justification of the first would have to meet since there's no discussion of such a justification in the first place.\n\nAt the same time, we can see that  the question-writer did make the second portion of this choice a little tricky since \"if the attrition problem cannot be successfully addressed,\" could be considered a presentation of a standard.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is tricky because the second boldfaced portion does state the main conclusion of the argument and the first boldfaced portion precedes the second. So, if we're not careful, we could perceive this choice to be correct.\n\nHowever, the truth is that the first boldfaced portion does not present an intermediate conclusion. Rather it presents a consideration in favor of continuing the management education program.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe question-writer made this choice a little tricky by including a couple correct parts:\n\nThe first is that the first boldfaced portion does present a policy: using performance during the program as a criterion in deciding among candidates.\n\nThe second is that \"if the attrition problem cannot be successfully addressed,\" could be considered a criterion for evaluating a policy.\n\nHowever, the rest of this choice is incorrect. After all, the argument merely mentions the policy of using performance during the program as a criterion in deciding among candidates and does not seek to evaluate it, and the criterion stated in the second boldfaced portion is not used for evaluating the policy presented by the first boldfaced portion.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nMany people choose (A) over this one, for a few reasons:\n\nOne is that, as we have seen, much of (A) is correct.\n\nAnother is that the first portion of this choice is convoluted. As we saw in our review of the passage, the first boldfaced portion presents a reason for Hachnut to continue using the management education program: \"Hachnut does use performance during the program as a criterion.\" However, the first portion of this choice doesn't say that in a simple way. Rather it says the same thing in a convoluted way:\n\n</table>\nA final reason why people don't select this choice is that the second portion says \"the argument's main conclusion\" in an unexpected and unfamiliar way, \"the evaluation at which the argument arrives.\" So, even though we can readily tell that the second boldfaced portion presents the argument's main conclusion, we can easily miss that the second portion of this choice is correct.\n\nNevertheless, as we can see, the first and second portions of this choice correctly describe the first and second boldfaced portions of the passage.\n\nThe correct answer is (E).",

Sabotaging the answer with the word \"\" is a sneaky trick that is particularly un-GMAT-like.  \n\nThe language in  &amp;  is odd: the GMAT CR BF Structure questions typically do not use the word \".\"  I suspect this sentence was written by someone who knew a lot about formal logic but not a lot about the GMAT.

The language \"\"---what does that mean?  Some Deity has proclaimed that it must be true?  That language is too extreme.  Also, the second BF sentence is simply the conclusion, not an inference in the GMAT-sense of the word.

It appears that originally, this was an LSAT question that some company semi-plagiarized and re-cast as a GMAT CR.  The very best thing you could do for your GMAT preparation is to blot this question out of your mind.  \n\nMy friend, there are many companies in the GMAT prep market, and not all are of the same quality.  Don't naively believe that a CR or SC or RC questions adheres to the high standards of the GMAT just because some company out there has the audacity to call it a GMAT practice question.  .

Of course, I think  also has very good questions, but because I work for them, you may well question whether I am biased.  I would say: read the reviews.  Ask around.  Notice what folks say in their testimonials.  Trust the sources about which people rave consistently.  Don't be naive about accepting anything as a worthwhile question.   Low quality material will not prepare you for the GMAT.  \n\nDoes all this make sense?\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)",

(D) describes that reasonably well.  \n\nWhat's wrong with (B)?\n\nWell, I agree with the second half --- the second bold is the second point of view.  The first part though --- think about it this way:\nSentence #1 = they have views: libraries are outdated\nSentence #2 = they have fiscal recommendation: don't fund libraries.  \nWhich way does cause-and-effect point?  Does it point from Sentence #1 to Sentence #2, or vice versa?  \nDo they want to cut funding to libraries because they think they're outdated?\nOr do they think libraries are outdated because they want to cut funding to them?\nI would say the former is a much more likely order of logic.  People decide such-and-such an institution is no good, then they start to gripe about tax money going to it.  \nThe thing that is the supporting reason is the evidence --- so sentence #1 is evidence for sentence #2, which is the view itself, not the other way around.  \nSentence #2 is NOT \"evidence that supports one of two contradictory points of view\" ---- rather, it IS that contradictory view, and sentence #1 is the evidence.  \nDoes that make sense?\n\nWhat's wrong with (E)?\n\nFirst of all, the author made no concessions --- in the first two sentences, the author was just objective descriptive and dispassionate.  Conceding means the author says something like, \"I hate to admit it, but my opponents are right when they say ...\"  Concession has to involve some kind of approval given to the opposing view.  This author merely states that view, and says nothing in support of it.  \nSecond, that sentence is not a \"consideration\" --- it's not a thoughtful reflective introspective insight into something meaningful about the issue.  No, it's just those loud mouths saying, \"We don't want tax money going to the outdated library!\"  That's a statement of fact, and not a particularly delicate one at that.  \nA consideration would be along the lines of \"It occurs to me, if one were to think through the long-term consequences of such a policy, etc.\"  It connotes thoughtfulness, a product of reflection, something that involves insight that would not be readily apparent to everyone.  Sentence #2 is nothing of the sort.  \nSentence #2 is simply a direct statement of the view that the author opposes, no more.  \n\nDoes that make sense?\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)",

In support of that belief, the letter writer offers the second boldface portion of the argument: an assertion that crimes are committed by drug users because they need money to buy expensive illegal drugs, and that if drugs were legal and therefore cheaper, the crimes would become unnecessary. The first boldface portion of the argument mentions an observed relationship between drug use and other crimes: when drug use declines, other crimes decline as well. This observation is counter to the letter writer’s ultimate claim. \n\n(A) The letter writer forecasts that violent crime will decline even if drug use is decriminalized. The first boldface portion does not offer support for that forecast, but rather evidence that violent crime decreases when anti-drug laws are enforced. The second boldface portion is not the letter writer’s forecast, but rather the support given for it. \n\n(B) The first boldface portion is an observation that violent crime decreases when anti-drug laws are enforced; that observation weighs against the letter writer’s main position, but falls short of refuting his claim that violent crime will decrease as a result of decriminalizing drug use. The second boldface portion is support for the letter writer’s main position, not the position itself. \n\n(C) The first boldface portion shows a direct relationship between a decline in drug activity and a decline in violent crime, but the letter writer does not argue that future events are predicted by this relationship. In fact, the letter writer ultimately claims the opposite: that violent crime will decrease when criminal penalties for drug use are eliminated, even if drug use increases as a result. \n\n The first boldface portion shows a direct relationship between a decline in drug activity and a decline in violent crime, but the letter writer claims that violent crime will decrease when criminal penalties for drug use are eliminated, even if drug use increases as a result. If true, the information in the second boldface section explains why the letter writer makes that claim: that the high cost of illegal drugs is the reason drug users commit violent crimes, so cheaper, legalized drugs will cause crime to decline. \n\n(E) The first boldface portion is presented by the letter writer as true. However, the second boldface is not an inference drawn from the first boldface portion; rather, it contradicts the first boldface portion.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "explanation": "But large profits on the new product will give competitors a strong incentive to quickly match the new product's capabilities.\n\nIn the argument above, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?\n\n\n(A) The first is a consideration that has been raised to argue that a certain strategy is counterproductive; the second presents that strategy.\n\n(B) The first is a consideration raised to support the strategy that the argument recommends; the second presents that strategy.\n\n(C) The first is a consideration raised to explain the appeal of a certain strategy; the second presents that strategy.\n\n(D) The first is an assumption, rejected by the argument, that has been used to justify a course of action ; the second presents that course of action.\n\n(E) The first is a consideration that has been used to justify pursuing a goal that the argument rejects; the second presents a course of action that has been adopted in pursuit of that goal. and  rests on the latter two points. In this argument, the first boldface portion presents the situation for why the author posits that \"the strategy to maximize overall profit from a new product is to charge less than the greatest possible price\" - the author and argument's overall conclusion. The second, is that strategy/conclusion. So, both points align with one-another, and align with the author. Thus,  makes a lot of sense! \n\nWe'll want to keep in mind that we're looking for why the author has chosen to include the information first and foremost. So, function of the detail should be what we look for in the boldface portions. In this case, \"Because technological advances tend to be quickly surpassed and companies want to make large profits while they still can, many companies charge the maximum possible price for such a product\" has been included to explain why \"the strategy to maximize overall profit from a new product is to charge less than the greatest possible price.\" \n\nIn answer choice  - the statements align with one-another, but run counter to the author's conclusion. In this case, the final boldface portion is the author's conclusion! So, the first certainly cannot be a \"consideration that has been used to justify pursuing a goal that the argument rejects,\" nor the second \"a course of action that has been adopted in pursuit of that goal.\" The goal mentioned in the argument (maximizing overall profit) is not rejected by the author's argument/conclusion. Instead, the author presents a strategy for how to do so in the second boldface portion, and uses the first to present why this strategy is appealing/sensible. \n\nThis is actually a very common trap set up in CR boldface arguments - since the argument introduces a point countered by the author. Because of this, test-takers will gravitate toward answer choices with conflicting or contrasting language. But keep in mind, the boldface portions are making the same point, and it's the point the author is making - so  fits perfectly!\n\n( poses a similar structure - in case you'd like to reinforce the point with another example!)\n\nSo, as much as possible, if you can try to whittle away the content and focus on the structure/function of the argument, you'll be able to differentiate between correct and convincing wrong answers, and move through questions like this one more efficiently and effectively!\n\nI hope this clarifies!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

It helps show how global temperature changes affect larger sea animals directly.\nD. It is offered as one reason that global warming must be curtailed.\nE. It is offered in support of the idea that global warming poses a threat to all organisms.\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:  A rise of just two degrees prevents the vertical mixing of seawater from different strata.  This restricts the availability of upwelling nutrients to phytoplankton.  Zooplankton, which feed upon phytoplankton, feed the rest of the food chain.  Seemingly inconsequential changes in sea temperature due to global warming eventually result in declines in fish and seabird populations. The conclusion in the first line is echoed again in the final sentence. The argument part referenced in the question stem is a premise (note the use of the premise indicator “since” in the last line), and your answer must indicate that the role played by the argument part is that of a premise. \n\nAnswer choice (A): The portion referenced in the question stem is not a hypothesis, but rather a statement of fact. \n\nAnswer choice (B): The statement referenced in the question stem is not an example of the way the mixing of seawater affects feeding habits, but rather another premise that is then combined with the vertical mixing premise to help support the conclusion. \n\n The phrase “it helps show” describes a premise, and in this case the premise is used to support a statement about the effect of temperature changes on fish and seabirds. \n\nAnswer choice (D): The argument does not take a position that global warming should be curtailed. Instead, the argument shows how small changes in sea temperature lead to population declines, and no opinion of those effects is stated. \n\nAnswer choice (E): This is an Exaggerated Answer.

We can rule out A, D and E as they are unrelated. B states that ‘the first contains the argument the author critiques’.

The word however initiating the boldface part hints that it introduces a counter premise, which is in fact positive for our main conclusion. Answers A, B and C distort the role of the sentence. \n\nAs there are no hidden conclusions in the bold sentence A is eliminated. \n\nB says that there is an objection that goes against the argument, but we know that it goes against the premises rather than the conclusion. \n\nC states that the sentence approves the evidences, while there is no evidence presented.\n\nD says that the highlighted sentence supports the argument. The argument is talking about lead pollution risks. The highlighted sentence states that the lead tests often miss high lead concentrations, meaning that the lead garbage is exposed as a regular one, leading to higher contamination.\n\nE says that the boldface is an explanation that clarifies the argument. This statement to be true we should have a paradox in the stimulus. The first sentence tells us that landfills are under jeopardy of lead contamination. The second and the third sentences talk about measurements that the garbage is supposed to undergo to be classified to avoid its exposure in wrong areas. Finally, the last sentence provides a fact telling us that the lead is often measured incorrectly using the most common tests. The information that the most common test are inaccurate cannot cancel the fact that the garbage is supposed to be checked for possible contaminants, as there are uncommon tests, which may reveal the result accurately.\n\nThe right answer is D.

When eaten, grain thus affected can cause ergotism, a disease associated with hallucinations and other disturbing psychological side effects. In the end we can conclude that the violence was the result of freakish weather conditions.\n\nWhich of the following is the most effective rebuttal to the contention made above?\n\n",

The wheat crop  have been infected - however, it is possible that such infection did not happen. Similarly, eating such infected wheat  cause hallucinations - then again, it is possible that the infected wheat crop did not produce any such effects.\n\nThe premises do not specify how probable the two \"could\"s are.

My problem is with the second part of this option - \"rather than contemporary evidence\".\n\nIn this context, I take \"contemporary\" to mean \"occurring at the same time\" or \"contemporaneous\", rather than belonging to the present time. I do this because this makes the option harder to rule out, since it is not necessary to use evidence from the present to arrive at this conclusion - we could also use evidence from the past. However, a reading of the passage makes it clear that contemporary evidence  used. For instance, data about historical rainfall appears to have been used - clearly evidence from the period in question.\n\nTherefore, not using contemporary evidence is not a criticism that can be leveled at this argument. However, at this point, we can hold on to this option.\n\n(C)Explanations of historical events cannot be convincing when too great a role is assigned to chance or the irrational.  historical events can be explained in a way that allows for chance to play a role?

        "question": "Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) is a condition characterized by an inability to focus on any topic for a prolonged period of time, and is especially common among children five to ten years old. A recent study has shown that 85 percent of seven-year-old children with ADD watch, on average, more than five hours of television a day. It is therefore very likely that Ed, age seven, has ADD, since he watches roughly six hours of television a day.\n\nThe argument above is flawed because it\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "The author's conclusion pops up at the end, where she states that Ed is likely to have ADD because he watches television a lot and is seven. The key piece of evidence is the recent study cited by the author that states that 85% of seven-year-olds with ADD watch more than five hours of television per day. The study thus discusses only the television-watching habits of seven-year-olds who have ADD. The author's conclusion is flawed because it makes a conclusion about a seven-year-old television watcher based on a study about sevenyear-old television watchers with ADD. In other words, there's a scope shift between the evidence and the conclusion. The author errs in accepting the survey as relevant to Ed. (B) expresses this flaw most clearly: In order to make conclusions about Ed and whether he might have ADD, the author must come up with evidence that pertains to Ed, since the original evidence does not. She needs a statistic that states the likelihood that a seven-year-old who watches more than five hours of TV a day would have ADD. The evidence provided sounds like that, but isn't, and (B) captures the gist of the author's mistake. (B) wins.\n\n(A) is confusing, but the argument isn't really about degrees of causation. The author doesn't suggest that age and television-watching cause a child to contract ADD, but that those factors generally appear with the disorder. (A) distorts the author's conclusion by suggesting that it says that Ed's television-watching has caused him to contract ADD, but the author never suggests this.\n\n(C) Yes, the description of ADD symptoms is limited in the manner cited in (C), but that's not a problem. Perhaps some doctors might disagree with the author's definition, but its validity is not the issue at the heart of this argument. Rather, the argument's concerned with Ed's chances of having ADD based on a particular study.\n\n(D) directly contradicts the stimulus, where we learn that Ed does actually watch more than five hours of television per day You may have also noticed that the 15% figure is bogus—it's derived from the 85% figure in the stimulus, but that figure refers to the percentage of children with ADD who watch more than five hours of TV a day. Inferably, we can therefore say that 15% of children with ADD do not watch more than five hours of TV a day, but we can't turn this into 15% of children in general who don't watch more than five hours, as (D) attempts to do.\n\n(E) again distorts the argument, which never suggests that television watching causes ADD. Since no causality is mentioned, we can only assume that the data represents a correlation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "The life cycle of stars is on the order of billions of years, much longer than a human life span or even the existence of astrophysics as a discipline. How do we understand the whole stellar life cycle? The Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram sorts stars into different categories depending on their properties. Stellar clusters are collections of stars all the same age. The location of all the stars in a single stellar cluster on an HR diagram demonstrates the categories for stars at that particular age, and a comparison of plots on the HR diagram for multiple stellar clusters indicates how the different kinds of stars change over the course of their life cycles. The achievement is analogous to that of an imagined intelligent mayfly that, despite being alive for only a single day, is able to figure out the entire human life cycle by observing __________________.\n\nWhich of the following most logically completes the passage?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "I happened upon this question because it was listed among the \"hardest CR questions\" of the year in gmatclub's year-end review. And as is the case most years, the hardest questions are the prep company questions that don't have a correct OA, so of course most people answering correctly get the question \"wrong\". Here we're asked how a mayfly might understand the \"entire human life cycle\". Human life doesn't start at age 27, or whatever age the college reunions in answer C might start at. So a mayfly can't understand the \"entire human life cycle\" by observing people 27 and older, and if we're filling in the blank logically, we can't just ignore those words. The best answer to my thinking is E, because then we find groups of people (rather than one individual person, as in D) of all ages (not just some ages, as in B). This intelligent mayfly can then cluster the people by age itself, just as the intelligent astronomers have done with stars to make their HR plots -- I don't see a reason here that we need an answer that indicates that people have already been organized into age groups (because the sentence begins with the nebulous word \"the achievement\", and it's not clear what \"the achievement\" refers to, precisely -- clustering the stars, then understanding them, or simply understanding them once the clusters have been made?).\n\nIt could be a good question if it were refined, but as it's written, I don't think the OA is justifiable.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

There is definitely nothing in the passage to make us think that this group would have comprised \"most participants\" in the Crusades, so this choice is unsupported.\n\nAnother manifestation of \"no trick questions\" on the official GMAT is that the correct answers will never contravene basic real-world common sense.\nThis principle is a good reason to get rid of choice B, because the aristocracy has always been a tiny minority out of every population that has ever had aristocrats——so there's just no feasible way that the group mentioned here, comprising only a fraction of the sons of the already-tiny aristocratic classes, could possibly have made up a majority of Crusaders (Christian soldiers).\n\n.\nContradicts the passage. Firstborn sons were the ones whose financial security was assured by birthright to their parents' wealth——i.e., the ones who  have to join expeditionary armies in order to eke out a livelihood.\n\n.\nUnsupported. The passage talks about how SOME young men became Crusaders because they DIDN'T have any way to make a living at home, but says nothing about whether men with the luxury of free choice did or didn't join for other reasons, even though they didn't HAVE to.\n\n.\nUnsupported.

        "question": "Which of the following best completes the passage? \n\nA company that makes electric razors recently introduced a new model that offered various features that ensured a degree of precision not possible with older models. After a year on the market, the new model proved to sell poorly compared to its older counterparts, leading the company to conclude that precision was not an important concern for consumers. However, this view was seriously challenged by a later finding that __________.\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "This question is really asking us to identify the finding that would most seriously weaken (or \"challenge\") the conclusion of the company, which was that \"precision was not an important concern for consumers.\" \n\nHow did the company reach that conclusion? We can infer that the company had already been selling multiple older razor models when it introduced a newer model, offering various features that ensured a degree of precision not possible with older models. This newer model did not sell as well as the older models after a year on the market. The company concluded that precision must not be an important concern for consumers, since those consumers were seemingly not attracted by the improved precision of the newer model.\n\nSo, did the newer model fail to sell as well as the older models because consumers are not very concerned with precision? Or could one of the findings in the answer choices have contributed to the poor sales numbers?\n\nThis finding tells us that faulty precision features can cause shoddy (\"poor quality\") haircuts and shaves, but it does not tell us whether precision is an important CONCERN for consumers (or what percentage of consumers actually saw this report). If consumers did read the report but do not care about precision, then the report would not motivate the consumers to buy the new model. In that case, the finding would actually  the company's conclusion, not challenge it. \n\nIf we somehow knew that a large proportion of consumers read the report, are concerned about precision, but still did not buy the new model for some other reason(s), then the finding would challenge the company's conclusion. But without further information, we cannot determine whether this finding supports the conclusion or challenges it, so (A) can be eliminated.\n\nThe finding in choice (B) provides another reason that explains why sales of the new model were relatively low. If consumers are concerned about precision but feel that they will get better  results from an older razor, then the consumers will not be inclined to buy the new model, despite being attracted to the enhanced precision that it offers. This alternative explanation does not  that consumers are indifferent to precision, so choice (B) does challenge the conclusion of the company. We'll keep this one.\n\nThis finding neither weakens nor strengthens the company's conclusion because it does not tell us whether the relatively low sales of the new model can be contributed to consumers' lack of concern for precision or to other factors. For example, given this finding, it is possible that, say, 40% (a \"significant\" part) of sales comes from hair salons and barber shops while 60% comes from individual consumers. If those consumers (the 60%) are not very concerned with precision, they might not have been enticed to buy the new model and sales would have been relatively low, supporting the company's conclusion. Or perhaps those consumers DO care about precision but chose not to buy the new model for other reasons. The finding in choice (C) may or may not challenge the company's conclusion and can be eliminated.\n\nif the razor DID significantly increase in price, then this finding would challenge the conclusion of the company because it would provide another reason why consumers may not have been inclined to buy the razor, despite being attracted to its enhanced precision. However, since the price did NOT increase, concern for precision may or may not have been a factor. Perhaps, as suggested by the company, consumers were not impressed with the enhanced precision and chose to stay with their current models. Or perhaps consumers WERE impressed by the enhanced precision but chose not to buy the newer model for other reasons (i.e., the new model may have been too complicated and difficult to use). Choice (D) can be eliminated.\n\nWe have no idea why those other models sold well. Perhaps the other companies had better marketing or offered much lower prices. Perhaps consumers were not interested in the precision features of those successful razors but instead were interested in various  features of those razors. We don't know if choice (E) challenges the conclusion of the company in the passage, so it can be eliminated. This leaves us with choice (B).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "explanation": "This question is really asking you to weaken the argument and the best way to weaken is to attack an assumption.  The conclusion is that legalizing dullnic doesn't harm illegal traffickers.  That conclusion is based on the premise that very little dullnic is sold in Fruitland.  For legalized (and cheaper/better) dullnic to not impact illegal traffickers we have to assume that the legal dullnic will only be sold in Fruitland.\n\nA-This attacks the assumption by saying that dullnic legally grown in Fruitland will be sold in other states, thereby reducing the revenues of illegal traffickers - CORRECT.\nB-Out of scope; we are talking about dullnic sales, not the sales of other illegal drugs\nC-Irrelevant - this does not give evidence about why the GRANT research logic is flawed\nD-This point is already addressed in the passage; very few sales happen in Fruitland so the impact on traffickers is minimal\nE-The answer needs to point out a flaw, but this point supports the logic in the argument that illegal traffickers would not be harmed by legalization\n\nKW\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n |  |",

This answer choice is tempting because we know that the economists feared another recession. But the policymakers and economists wanted to DISCONTINUE many of the New Deal agencies, not just prevent further expansion of federal authority. Choice (A) does not explain why the economists want to REDUCE the level of federal authority, so we can eliminate (A).\n\n(B) We are told that the policymakers and economists wanted to discontinue many of the New Deal agencies AFTER the economic depression, not during the depression. If the agencies administering financial relief are useful in  an economic depression, we wouldn't expect the economists to want to discontinue those agencies. However, choice (B) tells us that those agencies were designed only to provide financial relief (i.e. DURING an economic depression), not to maintain economic stability (i.e. AFTER an economic depression). This statement explains the economists' point of view, so let's hang on to choice (B).\n\n(C) This statement tells us how \"most americans\" felt but does not explain the point of view of the economists, so choice (C) can be eliminated.\n\n(D) The power and authority of the government agencies exceeded the limits defined when those agencies were created, but is that necessarily a bad thing? This information only tells us that the power of those agencies expanded but does not explain WHY economists grew uncomfortable with that expansion of power. Furthermore, choice (D) does not explain why the economists would want to get rid of agencies that are seemingly designed to combat economic depressions.

Since the average income in Nurland is $55,000 a year and these changes are only necessary , some critics argue that the changes are not necessary. However, the author concludes that these critics might be incorrect and that these changes might indeed be needed. \n\n\n\nThe question asks you to strengthen the author’s conclusion that the proposed changes might be . Since the argument states that the changes are necessary , the right answer must increase the chances that this is true for Nurland. The critics assume that because the average annual income is $55,000, the required threshold is not reached. However, knowing an average tells you nothing about the actual distribution of the data points in that set.  \n\n\n\n(A) The author states that the proposed changes are  a substantial portion of the population makes less than $20,000 a year. This answer does not make that more likely. Perhaps there is good reason to make changes to the social assistance program such that people earning between $10,000 and $20,000 a year receive social assistance—but it would not make it more likely to be necessary to implement the  changes proposed in this argument. \n\n(B) Many people in Nurland might rely on the  assistance program to survive, but that does not imply that the  are needed. The current program might be adequate for their needs.\n\n(C) Other countries might have used similar assistance programs to the one proposed and seen positive results, but that does not mean those changes were , either in those countries or in Nurland. This choice says only that the changes  [their] —a good thing but not necessarily required.\n\n If the median income in Nurland is , then 50% of the country earns  more than $85,000, or well more than $30,000 above the average of $55,000. In order for income to average to $55,000 when half of the population earns well more than $30,000 above the average, a high proportion of the remaining half must be at least $30,000 below that average, or well less than $25,000. This choice opens up the possibility that a substantial portion of Nurland’s population does earn less than $20,000 a year, thereby making the author’s claim at least somewhat more likely to be valid. \n\n(E) It might be easy to fund the new assistance program, but that does not strengthen the idea that the changes are .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "Explanation must be distinguished from justification. Every human action potentially has an explanation, that is, with sufficient knowledge it would be possible to give an accurate description of the causes of that action. An action is justified only when the person performing the action has sufficient reasons for the action. According to many psychologists, even when there is a justification for an action, that justification often forms no part of the explanation. The general principle, however, is that only an action whose justification, that is, the reasons for the action, forms an essential part of its explanation is rational.\n\nIf the statements in the passage are correct, which one of the following can be properly concluded from them?\n\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of the passage is that an action is considered to be rational only if the justification i.e reason for conducting that action is a subset of the explanation for that action. In other words a rational action is one in which the reason for conducting that action is able to explain the action itself. This can be confirmed by reading the last line of the prompt (highlighted in pink)\n\n\nThis statement makes a very bold claim that every justified action has no explanation. While the passage mentions that the justification often forms no part of the explanation it never mentions that the justification never forms a part\n\n\nIn essence this statement is trying to convey that every justified action is rational. But as we know only if the justification is able to explain the action then that action would be considered rational\n\n\nThis statement is similar to option A and repeats the same error\n\n\nThe objective of this passage is to analyze the underlying reasons for actions which are deemed as rational actions. The actions whose causes cannot be discovered in the first place are irrational actions and we are not concerned about them\n\n\nYes, so this statement can be inferred from the passage. Its trying to say that there might be actions in which the reasons for that action would in turn be the very cause of that action. And this can only be the case when the reason for the action is an subset of the explanation.\n\nE.g. Person X decides to start working out\n\nWhy to people work out in general (explanation of the action of working out)? - Improve fitness, increase activity etc.\nWhy did person X decide to work out (justification of action)? - X is suffering from say back pain and has been advised to do workout to improve fitness\n\nAs you can see how person X's justification forms part of the explanation for working out and how X's justification is the very cause of the action.\n\nAns -",

For example, it cannot be ruled out that they do not have a threshold at which point they would become price sensitive, but be careful of the scope:  “had no effect” means we are concerned only with the periods in question (the past).  Perhaps, also, they are not purchasing chicken for its intrinsic qualities…\n\nScan each answer choice by eliminating progressively each “wrong” answer to finish with the “best” answer:\n\n(C) establishes that this is not the case, that chicken is not simply being substituted for an even more expensive commodity, and this is vital to the argument.  We would still have no way of verifying or falsifying the conclusion regardless of whether (A) or (B) was true, so those choices are wrong, and consumers might still be price-sensitive even if they were richer.

        "question": "In recent years the fashion industry has become increasingly unable to ignore the reality of eating disorders among models. Although models are, as a group, thin beyond the “normal” standards of society, many have succumbed to nutritionally deficient eating habits in order to sustain unnatural weights, even for their super-physiques. The fashion industry has, in recent years, begun addressing the issue more openly. Some countries have gone so far as to establish rules that require models to maintain a certain BMI if they expect to walk the runways. Additionally, the industry recently held an international conference on the issue of eating disorders. But the overall mood there was one of resistance, among models as well as designers. Most of the models claim that they are just naturally very thin and are modeling for that very reason. They admit that some do develop eating disorders, but claim these disorders are often based on individual problems and not on the industry. Among the designers, the resistance was equally palpable. Most resented the interference and claimed that the fashion world has always relied on thin models and that it is unfair to single out a single industry for eating disorders, because eating disorders are connected to personal issues. Overall, the hope within the industry is that there will be awareness about eating disorders but not extra rules: models should know that help is available should they need it and that the industry will support them as they seek treatment.\n\nWhich of the following best expresses the main point of the passage above?\n\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Questions is based on a passage about the presence of eating disorders in the fashion industry, particularly among models. The author notes that the fashion industry cannot ignore the reality of eating disorders but that there are a variety of objections to restrictions on the fashion industry, objections from both models and designers. Models often complain that they are naturally thin, while designers point out that eating disorders are not unique to the fashion industry; they claim that eating disorders are connected to personal concerns that cannot be addressed with rules regarding weight or BMI requirements. The passage concludes by noting that the industry is inclined to accept “awareness about eating disorders but not extra rules,” that resources for dealing with eating disorders will be available, and that models should seek help when they realize they have a problem. Question asks the student to determine the main point of \nthe passage.\n\n\n\nD There are several important details in the passage that contribute to the main point: (1) the fashion industry is not happy with the idea of further restrictions about weight and eating disorders, (2) the industry wants to provide awareness about eating disorders, (3) the industry wants the models to seek help by themselves. The correct answer will pull these three details into a summary statement. Answer choice (D) is the only answer choice to combine all three and thus restate the main point of the passage, so it is the correct answer.\n\n\n\nA Although the response from designers suggests that they believe eating disorders are related to factors other than fashion and thus cannot simply be eliminated by changing weight requirements among models, there is nothing in the passage to suggest that the industry as a whole believes eating disorders are “inevitable” and impossible to eliminate. Answer choice (A) cannot be correct.\n\nB Answer choice (B) expresses one part of the discussion in the passage: the viewpoint of models and designers on the source of eating disorders. It does not, however, express the main point of the passage, which notes that the industry is open to providing awareness but wants models to seek help on their own. Answer choice (B) is incorrect because it focuses on a secondary detail instead of the main point.\n\nC As with answer choice (B), answer choice (C) expresses a supporting detail of the main point: that the industry tends to seek out models who are naturally thin and that they are not necessarily thin in an unhealthy way. But answer choice (C) does not go one step further to apply this to the bigger issue at hand, about how the industry would prefer eating disorders to be treated. Answer choice (C) is thus incorrect since it focuses on a secondary detail.\n\nE There it nothing in the passage to suggest that rules for BMI will be ignored; in fact, the passage notes, “Some countries have gone so far as to establish rules that require models to maintain a certain BMI if they expect to walk the runways.” This indicates that the rules for BMI are being observed, and that this is a source of frustration for designers and models in the fashion industry, because they believe that BMI is not a sufficient indicator of healthy weight. Answer choice (E) is clearly incorrect.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

Only these people have an increased risk of developing cancer because of heartburn.\n\n\"Which one of the following most accurately expresses the overall conclusion drawn in the argument?\"\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Identify The Conclusion\n\nIt’s false to think that unrelieved heartburn will probably cause esophageal cancer.\n\nOnly those with Barrett’s esophagus have a higher risk of cancer due to heartburn. Only 5% of those who get heartburn have Barrett’s esophagus.\n\nAny time an author gives their opinion about the truth, it’s almost certainly the conclusion.\n\nSo when the author says “this is simply false” it means that their conclusion is that they disagree with the first sentence.\n\nThis is a good argument, by the way. You might have thought that the author admitted that heartburn can cause cancer. The author did admit this. But their conclusion is that heartburn isn’t likely to cause cancer. “Likely” means “51% of the time or more” –  it’s a synonym for most. So 5% of the time isn’t enough to make cancer risk “likely”.\n\n___________\n\nA.This is evidence that supports the conclusion that cancer risk isn’t likely.\n\nB.This is evidence that supports the idea that those with Barrett’s esophagus do have an increased risk of cancer.\n\nThe first sentence made the claim that heartburn is likely to cause cancer. The second sentence shows that the author disagrees. When the author presents a claim and disagrees with it, that will be their conclusion.\n\nD. This is just a fact that allows the author to make his argument. If advertisements weren’t making this claim, the author would have nothing to talk about. But the conclusion is that the author disagrees with these commercials.\n\nE. This isn’t even true, necessarily. It’s possible that TV advertisements are so targeted that the ads are mostly seen by those with Barrett’s esophagus. So the ads would be relevant to the viewers.

So, the conclusion says that the solution (monetary value) itself creates the problem that is intended to be solved i.e monetary value depends on costs and benefits.\n\nLooking at the answer choices it seems that figuring out the assumption could help us eliminate a few answer choices. \nSo, under what conditions the environmental economics will not be stymied by what motivates it?\n\nWhat if the monetary value can be derived by other means? What if monetary value is not dependent on deriving comparisons between environmental factors and economic decisions? The passage nowhere assures us that C&amp;B is the only route to get a monetary value. (Just like mathematical formulas - we use different formulas according to what is given to find out the answer).\nThen this might have been the assumption of author \n\nNow look at answer choices\n\nIf the considerations advanced in its support are true, the passage’s conclusion is supported\n\n\n(A) strongly, on the assumption that monetary values for environment factors cannot be assigned unless people make economic decisions about these factors........sounds similar to our assumption.\n\n(B) strongly, unless economic decision-making has not yet had any effect on the things categorized as environmental factors............EDM's effect on things categorized as environmental factors is not a concern.......... doesn't affect our conclusion anyway.\n\n(C) at best weakly, because the passage fails to establish that economic decision-makers do not by and large take adequate account of environmental factors...........we do not know how efficient the economic decision makers are\n\n(D) at best weakly, because the argument assumes that pollution and other effects on environmental factors rarely result from economic decision-making..........off the point....this cannot be an assumption. It does not affect our conclusion\n\n(E) not at all, since the argument is circular, taking that conclusion as one of its premises.....It is not circular..It provides evidence to make us believe that assigning the monetary value may not be the solution.\n\nA is correct",

For the first time ever, most of the copies sold were not sold to accountants but rather to individuals doing their own taxes or planning their own family budgets. However, the most-purchased copy of accounting software was a program designed for accountants performing corporate audits.\n\nWhich of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?\n",

Remember - in an Inference question the correct answer must be true based on the premises, and (C) can be proven by the facts. You know that 1) the total number of copies of accounting software was its greatest ever and that 2) the percentage that non-accountants purchased was its greatest ever (the first time over 50%). So non-accountants purchased their greatest-ever share of the greatest-ever total, meaning that they must have purchased their greatest number of copies of accounting software ever.\n\nAmong the incorrect answer choices:\n\n(A) very well might be true, but cannot be proven. What if the growth in accounting software was entirely due to non-accountants (perhaps this was the first-ever year that a program like TurboTax was available, and so the non-accountant software surged while several accountants went out of business and didn't purchase anything)?\n\n(B) also could be true, but you certainly cannot prove it. What if the most-sold software was a must-buy for any corporation but had no appeal to individuals?\n\n(D) is close, but note the precision in language there: all the premises are about the number of copies sold, whereas (D) draws a conclusion about the number of purchasers. What if the number of purchasers stayed the same or even decreased, but each purchaser bought multiple different copies (maybe TurboTax came with a \"add on Quicken for a dollar\" promotion and almost everyone who purchased one piece of software last year bought two this year?).\n\nAnd (E) of course does not have to be true as there is no proof for it anywhere.

Key to solve this question is “question stem”. . \n\nA little bit difference between the two. \n\n\n- Fact test / No “new info” accepted\n- Correct answers (1) Paraphrasing OR (2) Combination\n\n\n- Subcategory  of Must be true\n- Have to pass “Fact test”\n- \n\nThus, premises is WRONGhearing in people who have tiny bones in the inner ear damaged. The word “” clearly indicate that people are  even though the hearing quality is not really good.\n\nB)Most hearing loss is due to neurological malfunctioning.\n The conclusion says: “small percentage of the hearing-impaired population (who have tiny bones damaged) will benefit”. But “small” differs from “none”. Thus, we cannot infer that “ hearing loss is due to neurological malfunctioning”.\n\nC)More people have impaired hearing because of neurological damage than because of damage to the tiny bones of the inner ear.\n It’s not the correct answer. The reason is:\nwe cant infer this because the argument ONLY states that :\nprocedure will benefit a relativelypercentage of the hearing-impaired population.\n\nLet say there are 10 types of hearing impairment(including bone damage one and neurologically impaired)\nlet say this procedures cures only those impairments which is caused by BONE DAMAGE.....still the statement holds that :procedure will benefit a relativelypercentage of the hearing-impaired population.\nhence that option is not repeated in the premise.\n\n\nD)Hearing loss due to neurological damage is more severe than hearing loss due to damage to the tiny bones in the inner ear.\nOut of scope.

The passage itself uses a lot of confusing verbiage to make you think it's very technical, but the reality is pretty straightforward. One can go at it from a draw a conclusion standpoint, but it functions weirdly well as a straightforward find the assumption question: \n\nConclusion: Gov't should only outlaw strikes when nobody else can do the work. \n\nPremises: Without strikes, disputes settled by binding arbitration.  This is a costly mistake.\n\nThe question we have to ask is WHY is this a costly mistake? Only one thing would explain it.\n\nAssumption: Binding arbitration is good for the workers/bad for the gov't. (i.e. gov't loses more $ on this kind of dispute).\n\n(A) Where public-service workers are permitted to strike, contract negotiations with those workers are typically settled without a strike.\nProblem: The question here is about whether strikes can be bad for government, not whether or not they happen.\n\n(B) Where strikes by all categories of pubic-sector workers are outlawed, no acceptable substitutes for the services provided by any of those workers are available.\nProblem: This is what the conclusion recommends, but it doesn't help us understand why.\n\n(C) Binding arbitration tends to be more advantageous for public-service workers where it is the only available means of settling labor disputes with such workers.\nAnswer: Aha. Now we're told that binding arbitration tends to help out the worker bees. Interesting.\n\n(D) Most categories of public-sector workers have no counterparts in the private sector.\nProblem: We don't care about the private sector, or really whether or not \"most\" categories have counterparts elsewhere.\n\n(E) A strike by workers in a local government is unlikely to be settled without help from an arbitrator.\nProblem: That wasn't the question. The question is whether it's better to do it through binding arbitration (which is what you get without a strike), or the type of arbitration you get after a strike (which conforms to precedent).\n\nHope that helps!\n\nTommy Wallach",

        "question": "A large-scale study of adults over fifty years old who spent an average of four to eleven hours a day sitting found that the mortality rates of those who spent less time sitting were consistently lower over three years - even after controlling for age, weight, general health, and exercise frequency, all of which affect mortality rates. The researchers concluded that most adults over fifty years old could lower their mortality risk over the next three years just by spending less time sitting.\n\nIn order to assess the strength of the researchers' reasoning, it would be most helpful to know whether most adults over fifty years old\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of the argument is the following:\n\n\n\nThe conclusion is supported by the following:\n\n\n\nWe see that the researchers have observed a correlation between amount of time sitting and mortality rate and concluded, basically, that the first causes the second.\n\n\n\nThe correct answer will be the one such that, if most older adults over fifty years old do it, the argument is strengthened or weakened and, if most of them do not do it, the effect on the argument will be the opposite of the effect of the fact that they do it.\n\n\n\nThis choice is interesting.\n\nIf adults who spend less time sitting exercise more frequently, then maybe exercising rather than sitting less is the reason for the lower mortality rate of those who sit less. In that case, we could seem to have information that there is a possible alternative reason for the correlation between amount of sitting and mortality rate, which would weaken the argument.\n\nOn the other hand, if adults who spend less time sitting do not exercise more frequently, then we may have ruled out an alternative reason for the correlation between the amount of sitting people do and the mortality rate. In that case, we could seem to have ruled out that exercising more is the reason for the lower mortality rate of those who sit less and thus strengthened the argument.\n\nSo, it could seem that knowing whether adults over fifty years old who spend less time sitting exercise more frequently would be helpful in evaluating the argument, and thus this choice is exactly the kind of choice we'd expect to see in an Evaluate the Argument question involving a cause-effect type of conclusion.\n\nHowever, we have to be careful not to just look for familiar patterns in Critical Reasoning.\n\nAlso, we have to pay close attention to details of the passage, and in this case, the passage says the following:\n\n age, weight, general health, and , all of which affect mortality rates\n\nThis choice makes no difference either way.\n\nRegardless of whether most adults over fifty years old spend less than eleven hours a day sitting, the researchers have found that, for the ones who spend four to eleven hours a day sitting, the less they sit, the lower the mortality rate.\n\nIn other words, maybe most adults don't spend less than eleven hours sitting. Maybe most spend eleven hours sitting. In that case, the evidence provided is still a reason to believe the conclusion.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is interesting.\n\nIf adults who are in poorer general health are therefore inclined to spend more time sitting, then maybe the observed correlation between amount of time spent sitting and mortality rate doesn't mean there is a cause-effect relationship between sitting and mortality. It could instead be that poorer general health causes both sitting and mortality.\n\nSo, the fact that adults who are in poorer general health are therefore inclined to spend more time sitting could seem to weaken the case for the researcher's conclusion.\n\nOn the other hand, information that adults who are in poorer general health are not therefore inclined to spend more time sitting could seem to serve to rule out an alternative reason for the correlation between the amount of sitting people do and the mortality rate. So, that information could seem to strengthen the argument.\n\nSo, it could seem that knowing whether adults who are in poorer general health are therefore inclined to spend more time sitting would be helpful in evaluating the argument, and thus this choice is exactly the kind of choice we'd expect to see in an Evaluate the Argument question involving a cause-effect type of conclusion.\n\nHowever, we have to be careful not to just look for familiar patterns in Critical Reasoning.\n\nAlso, we have to pay close attention to details of the passage, and in this case, the passage says the following:\n\n age, weight, , and exercise frequency, all of which affect mortality rates\n\nThe argument is based on information adults who spend four to eleven hours a day sititng, but if \"most adults over fifty years old\" spend less than four hours a day sitting then maybe what the researchers found doesn't apply to \"most adults over fifty years old.\"\n\nOn other other hand, if most adults over 50 years old spend at least four hours a day sitting, then what the researchers' found does apply.\n\nThat said this choice is similar to (B), and we eliminated (B). So, why not eliminate this choice too?\n\nHere's the thing.\n\nWe've shown for sure that (A), (C), and (E) cannot work. Thus, we're down to (B) and (D). So, we need to choose between those two, and there's a key difference between them.\n\n(B) is \"spend less than eleven hours a day sitting.\" Notice that, if they do not \"spend less than eleven hours a day sitting,\" then they could still spend eleven hours a day sitting, which is within the range of the study.\n\nOn the other hand, (D) is spend at least four hours a day sitting. If they do not \"spend at least four hours a day sitting\" then they are already spending less time sitting than anyone involved in the study spent. So, they are not in the range studied. They are already beating it for sure.\n\nSo, since we have to choose one, we choose (D).\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThe passage say that the adults studied \"spent an average of four to eleven hours a day sitting.\" So, the conclusion is based on average amounts of time spent sitting, not on numbers of hours spent on each individual day.\n\nThus, regardless of whether the adults who participated in the study were approximately consistent in the numbers of hour they spent sitting each day, the study results still support the conclusion, since the conclusion is based on averages, which will be the same regardless of whether the study participants were approximately consistent in the numbers of hour they spent sitting each day.\n\nEliminate.\n\n D",

        "question": "Living near the sea provides a unique sensory experience. Initially, the sound of waves crashing against the shore is captivating and evokes a sense of tranquility. However, over time, individuals who reside in coastal areas may notice a gradual decline in their ability to perceive the sound of the waves. This phenomenon, known as \"auditory habituation,\" occurs as the brain adapts to the constant auditory stimulus and filters out the repetitive sound. Despite this adaptation, the rhythmic presence of the sea continues to have a profound subconscious impact, influencing emotions and creating a deep connection to nature.\n\nWhat is the underlying concept explored in the passage?\n",

        "question": "The Bolostus minatosis virus is usually fatal to humans unless treatment begins within the seven-day incubation period of the virus.  A doctor can administer a blood test that will identify with 99 percent accuracy whether someone has contracted the virus, but the blood sample must be sent to a laboratory for analysis, a process that requires four days to complete.  A new testing device analyzes a breath sample to identify the presence of the virus, and it performs the analysis instantaneously.  Clearly, replacing the traditional blood test by making the breath analysis device available in all doctors' offices would reduce the number of fatalities caused by the B. minatosis virus.\n\nThe answer to which of the following questions would be LEAST useful in evaluating the claim made in the argument above?\n",

Traditional blood test method is accurate 99% of the time, but it takes 4 days for the receival of the results. A newly developed method involves just a breath sample and the analysis is completed. \nConclusion : More fatalities can be prevented by the breath sampling method than Blood test method.\n\nOption (B) and (C) both, I believe do not help us in evaluation of the argument.\nSince our only time frame is within the detection of the exam in the first week (given theat the MB disease is fatal post 7 days of incumbation period), knowing the propotion of people who survived and received the treatment withing the first week would not help. Given that the number of fatalities will remain the same if the disease is detected after 7 days, and will remain the same also if the disease is detected during the incubation period. In option (B), the only way such a statistics will help is if suppose the person with MB disease goes to the hospital 3 days after the disease has infected the person, and hence then if we have the breath apparatus, it will help in reducing the number of fatalities. This explaination is nothing but option (A). \nThe same is the reason for option (C) the training is completely irrelevant for the reduction in the fatalities. Only affect this argument will have will only be that instead of the reduction in the number of fatalities which would happen at the \"t\" day, will probably will lead to \"t+10\" day\n\n</a>\nKindly please help me explain where have I made my error in my explaination",

However, no such tools dating to before 13,000 years ago have been found anywhere between Alaska and South America.\n\nSmith: Your evidence is inconclusive.

Perhaps 13,500 year-old wooden tools in Central America and 14,000 year-old wooden tools in North America.\n\nSmith, on the other hand, refutes Jones’s claim by pointing out that older wooden tools were not found along the migration route because they quickly decompose except in peat bogs, which are rare along the path.\n\n(C) No. There is no discussion of the accuracy of the dating method used.\n\n(D) No. Although this issue is probably in dispute, we cannot tell from the excerpt. Smith does not state or imply that the people crossed at a particular time; rather he points out a flaw in Jones’s interpretation of the evidence.\n\n(E) No. The meaning of the evidence is in dispute, not its accuracy.

        "question": "In 1973, a remote town first acquired television. Shortly before broadcasts began there, a study was made of children's behavior. A similar study in the same community, after two years of TV, showed that the aggression rate among children of this age had increased by 160%. The conclusion drawn was that TV plays an important role in generating aggressive behavior in children. A second study, covering the same years, was made in two similar communities that had had television for decades. This study showed no change in the aggression rate from 1973 to 1975. The results of the second study:\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "This is a complicated question and requires a complicated explanation. It is important to keep in mind just what the reported results are. Perhaps most important, nothing is said about the absolute values of the aggression rates, but only about changes in the rates. And nothing is said about how the rates in the other two communities compared with those of the first. The first study correlated two changes-the change from no TV to TV in 1973, as well as the change in aggression rates from 1973 to 1975. The tentative conclusion is that the first of these changes was the cause of the second change. The second study focused on communities in which there was no change --they were already well accustomed to TV in 1973. (Thus the second study focuses on a sort of natural \"control group.\") That study found that there was no change of the second type - aggression rates in those communities remained constant from 1973 to 1975. The second study thus tends to reduce the plausibility of the suggestion that some change other than the introduction of TV caused the rise in aggressiveness in the first community. If there was some other cause, at least it doesn't seem to have been acting in the communities of the second study. And that reduces the range of possible candidates. Thus the second study tends to make more probable the conclusion drawn from the first study.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "explanation": "Here is my Analysis:\n\nConclusion:\nAn editorial in the Grandburg Daily Herald claims that Grandburgâ€™s voters would generally welcome the defeat of the political party now in control of the Grandburg City Council.\nPremise:\nThe editorial bases its claim on a recent survey that found that 59 percent of Grandburgâ€™s registered voters think that the party will definitely be out of power after next yearâ€™s city council elections.\n\n(A) The way voters feel about a political party at a given time can reasonably be considered a reliable indicator of the way they will continue to feel about that party, barring unforeseeable political developments.\n\n\"Feeling about the party\" is different from \"voting for the party\". Even if voters continue to feel about the party the same way as they did earlier, it is not for sure that they will vote against the party.\n\n(B) The results of surveys that gauge current voter sentiment toward a given political party can legitimately be used as the basis for making claims about the likely future prospects of that political party.\n\n\"surveys that gauge current voter sentiment toward a given political party \" and \"survey that the party will definitely be out of power after next year\" are different again. Why?\nBecause, Voters may have sentiment towards some party and can also claim that the party will be out of power next year.\nExample: John likes to see congress in power. But he has a gut feeling that congress will have to step down next year.\n\nAssume that out of 100, 75 voters had sentiment toward a political party. But 59 guessed that it would be out of power next year. This does not mean that the 59 would vote against the party. This proportion discrepancy is fixed in option D.\n\n(C) An increase in ill-feeling toward a political party that is in power can reasonably be expected to result in a corresponding increase in support for rival political parties.\n\nAgain the same mistake as above. \"ill feeling towards party\" is different from \"assuming party to step down\"\n\n(D) The proportion of voters who expect a given political possibility to be realized can legitimately be assumed to approximate the proportion of voters who are in favor of that possibility being realized.\n\nWhat is the political possibility to be realized here? Guessing that the current party will step down.\nWhat is the proportion of such people... 59 out of 100\n\nSo if the conclusion has to stay correct, equal proportion of voters should be voting for that possibility. In other words proportion of voters who are in favor of that possibility being realized should also be 59 out of 100. Only then the conclusion holds true.\n\n(E) It can reasonably be assumed that registered voters who respond to a survey regarding the outcome of a future election will exercise their right to vote in that election.\n\nEven if all the Registered voters exercise their right to vote in the election, we are not sure which party they are voting against. Conclusion cannot hold true.\n\nHope this helps!!",

Her premises are:\n•\tA good art critic is not fair in any sense\n•\tOne can give a truly unbiased opinion only about things that do not interest one\n•\tArt is a passion\n•\tGood criticism of art cannot be separated from emotion\n\nMonique concludes that art is not simply a passion. Her premises are:\n•\tThe best art critics are passionately involved with the artwork they assess\n•\tBut the art critics give their criticism only after getting rid of their biases\n•\tThe art critics give their criticism after consulting general principles of aesthetics\n\nWhen we break down the arguments and compare their conclusions and premises, we see that their conclusions are different. However, we can also see that both their premises contain the word ‘bias’.\n\nTania feels that a good art critic is not fair and that it is not possible to give an unbiased opinion if one is interested in something.\n\nMonique, on the other hand, feels that an art critic might be passionately involved with the artwork that he or she assesses, but is able to set aside the bias that arises out of the passion before giving his or her criticism.\n\nSo, what we see here is that the basis on which the two of them disagree is whether good art criticism is sometimes unbiased. That is what Option B states, so it is correct.\n\nOption A is a direct restatement of Monique’s conclusion. Tania also says that art is a passion. So, Monique doesn’t disagree with Tania about this but extends the idea. So, Option A can be eliminated.  \n\nBoth of them agree that art critics feel emotion about artwork. Option C contradicts Tania and Monique. So, Option C is incorrect.\n\nMonique states that critics give their assessment after getting rid of their biases but Tania states that it one is truly unbiased only about things that do not interest one. So, both agree that to be fair requires minimizing bias. So, Option D can also be eliminated. \n\nNeither one of them discusses what the most important aspect of art criticism is.

There would not be any change in the number of ticks that feed on white-footed mouse. Therefore though the number of uninfected ticks would increase, the number of infected ticks would remain unchanged.\n\nAnswer No: Size of the deer tick population is currently NOT  limited by the availability of animals for the tick's larval stage to feed on.\nThis implies that there is already more food for the ticks than required. Increasing other species would not increase the total number of ticks - introduction of other species would distribute the existing ticks more sparsely on the white-footed mouse, because some of the ticks who used to feed on the white footed mouse may now feed on the other species because of higher availability of the latter. \n\nAnswering yes implies that the number of infected ticks would not change, but answering no implies that the number infected ticks would decrease.

The reasoning behind this is that there is an alternate (fresh parsley) available which is far more tasty and healthy than dried parsley.\n\nSo, since there is a healthier and tastier alternative available, we should not opt for dried parsley.\nTo justify the argument, we need a statement saying that we should always use the healthiest or tastiest option available to us.\n\nLets examine the options :-\n\n\nThis options leaves the room for dried parsley to be used. If you don't have fresh parsley, you could use the dried one as only when possible should you choose the fresh ingredients. Hence it can't justify the stem.\n\n\n\nThis is the correct answer. It abolishes the use of ingredients unless they are the tastiest ones. We don't know that fresh parsley is the tastiest one, but we do know that dried parsley isn't. So no matter what the case, you should never use dried parsley.\n\n\n\nIt is not stated that dried parsley isn't tasty or healthy. All we do know, is that the fresh one is tastier and healthier. Can't justify our stem.\n\n\n\nAgain, as in C, we can not say that dried parsley isn't tasty or healthy. Even if this were true, we need to establish that dried parsley is neither healthy nor tasty, which is not possible with the information given in the stem.

Therefore, if the press agent told every reporter everything about the accident, then no reporter knows any more about it than any other reporter. If no reporter knows any more about the accident than any other reporter, then no reporter can scoop all of the other reporters. However, the press agent did not tell every reporter everything about the accident. It follows that some reporter can scoop all of the other reporters.\n\nThe argument's reasoning is flawed because the argument fails to recognize that which one of the following is consistent with the facts the argument presents?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "This argument sets up the press agent as a gatekeeper of information. The ONLY way for reporters to get information about an accident is through the press agent. So, if the press agent tells   of the info, then no reporter can scoop the other reporters (scoop means to report information first). \n\nHowever, the press agent did NOT tell everyone all of the info. From this, the author concludes that \"some reporter can scoop all of the other reporters.\"\n\nNotice that the argument doesn't tell us what the press agent actually DID tell the reporters. Did he/she treat the reporters fairly and at least give them all the  info? Or did he/she pull one reporter aside and give that reporter more info than the rest of the reporters received? In the first scenario, no reporter could scoop the other reporters, and the author's argument falls apart. In the second scenario, the reporter who received more information CAN scoop the other reporters, just as the author argues.\n\nThe question asks us to identify the situation that is consistent with the argument and shows a flaw in the author's reasoning. In other words, which answer choice shows us a possible situation in which some reporter could NOT scoop the other reporters?\n\nHere's (E):\nThis points out the flaw we identified above. Sure, the press agent didn't give ALL of the reporters ALL of the information. But that doesn't mean that the press agent gave one reporter more information than everyone else. Maybe the press agent just gave ALL of the reporters the same, information. Then, all of the reporters would be on the same playing field, and \"no reporter [would know] any more about the accident than any other reporter,\" as stated in (E). \n\nThis is entirely consistent with the info in the passage, and would prevent some reporter from scooping the other reporters. That's why (E) is the correct answer. \n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

BUT sales guy thinks that the editor is talking about advertisments in magazines in genral and not the favourable mention of products IN the articles. So he says that readers know that advertisments are not articles, but the editor is talking about advertisment IN the article . SO basically we are compromising the integrity of the magazines right?? INTEGRITY = honesty/unfavoured /clean .\nEditor never talks about response of readers to the advertisments they see  . he talks about favourable mention IN the articles.\nFor eg :\nif we open the economist magazine there are dozens of advertisments lurking around , but do the ARTICLES  mention any product of some company for the sole reason of advertisment . Sure you'll see advertisements AROUND the articles but do you see any mention of a product and that too in an endorsing tone?? I havent !! \nlet us consider a magazing XYZ\nYou are reading an article . You'll see many ads around (so annoying) . The advertisers want to the editor to MENTION THEIR PRODUCTS IN A FAVOURABLE MANNER IN THEIR ARTICLES. EMPHASIS ON. Now imagine you are reading an article, but suddenly you start reading some about some product which may or may not be relevant to the topic. \nThing you feel :1) What the hell is this doing here?? 2) Oh so XYZ is greedy for money 3) There are tons of products why is it mentioning only this porduct? Maybe XYZ is favouring this product . 4) Basically , if they are being favourable to this product , then what's the point of reading any of its articles?? they may all be biased right??? I may stop subsrbing tot his mag because of the loss of INTEGRITY (unbiased/ ethical ) of artciles. \nThis is exactly what the point the editor is making.\n\nSales guy : readers know that advertisements are not articles. Hey sales bro ! are you even talking about the specific \"favourable mention in articles\" or are you just talking about . Becasue if that's the point you are making then you are either new here or you are fired because you are NOT TALKING about my concern (favourable mention in the article). I agree with you that ppl know that ads and articles are different, but what about the ads IN ARTICLES??? who is gonna talk about that?? so how they evaluate the ads is not my concern !! please be specific about my concern or get out !!\n\n\n- Does not succeed , because both are talking about different aspects\n- Does not succeed\n\n.\n-does not succeed\n- the sales guy does not misunderstand editor's view about readers' view on ads they see IN MAGZ. editor is concerned about preserving the  of the article and not about response to ads in MAGZ. to misunderstand a view , there has to be a view . But editor's view is completely different.\n\nNote: There may be instances in which you'll find that i am tgalking about a website but just consider a magazine.

This is, the advocates say, because the five-cent redemption programs provide a strong incentive to return the used containers to recycling facilities. However, a recent study found that states without a bottle deposit had more success in implementing comprehensive recycling programs, which include paper, plastics, and steel, in addition to the beverage containers, than did states with a bottle deposit law.\n\nThe answer to which of the following questions would be most useful in analyzing the significance of the study referenced above?\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "As is common with study/survey questions, it is important to know whether the groups being compared are actually comparable. \ne.g. say in a study, people were divided into two equal groups. One group was put on a sea food diet and the other group was put on a lean meat diet. After 6 months, the average cholesterol level of group 1 was substantially lower than that of group 2. \nNow to understand the validity of this result, we need to know multiple things:\n1. Was the average cholesterol of group 1 comparable with that of group 2 before the study?\n2. Were the exercise, medicine etc regimes of both groups the same?\netc\n\nLet's get on with our original question now: a recent study found that states without a bottle deposit had more success in implementing comprehensive recycling programs, which include paper, plastics, and steel, in addition to the beverage containers, than did states with a bottle deposit law.\nSo the study says that states without a bottle deposit have more successful comprehensive recycling programs. What we need to understand is whether the two study groups (states with bottle deposit and states without bottle deposit) are comparable. \n\nWhat does option (C) say?\nC) When the five-cent deposit programs were implemented, were the citizens of the states that began programs as enthusiastic about recycling as the citizens of the other states?\nThe question is whether the states with bottle deposit were on similar level of enthusiasm before implementation as states without bottle deposit. This is similar to point 1 of example above. \nWas the level of recycling similar of the two groups before the bottle deposit program started? The logic of this is that what if bottle deposit program was started in states which had very low enthusiasm towards recycling? Perhaps the bottle deposit program improved enthusiasm. The level of recycling may not be the same as in those states where the enthusiasm for recycling was anyway high but still an improvement from before. Hence it is good to know whether the level of enthusiasm in the two sets was same before the program was implemented. \nThis is the answer.\n\nAs for (D),\nD) Did citizens of the states with and without bottle deposit programs purchase comparable numbers of beverages in plastic, glass and aluminium containers?\nThe measure of success of the recycling program would be a relative parameter such as percentage of recyclable material that actually gets recycled. Say 10 million tonne of recyclable material is sold in a year in the form of beverage bottles etc. The measure of success of the program could be what percentage of this 10 million tonnes comes back to be recycled. So the actual number of bottles etc is irrelevant.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

The societies struggling for friendliness, congeniality, and politeness must adopt violence or threat of violence in reaching their goal of bonhomie.\n\nSource: </div>\nInteresting question. In my opinion, the answer is D\nRemember, this is an inference question. Therefore, what we read is the only information that can be used to find the answers\n\nA. This is tempting. Note that the prompt says \"in many cultures, these two forces work together\", but the prompt does not say that this occurs in ALL cultures. Therefore, we cannot make the assumption that violence and friendliness ALWAYS go together.\nB. Irrelvant. The prompt does not say that violence CAUSES societies where friendliness is the norm, but just that both violence and friendliness exists in socieities\nC. Another temping answer. Wrong because of the same reasoning as A\nD. CORRECT. Again, the prompt notes that \"The paradox of politeness is that.....in many cultures, these two forces work together....creating societies\". Therefore, without the two forces of violence and friendliness, some polite societies today may not have been so\nE. Irrelevant. What is this \"bonhomie goal\" in the answer. I have no idea",

        "question": "In order to maintain the competitive edge our company has gained through extensive research, decades of experience, and development of innovative methods, we must ensure that information security remains a top priority. The information stored on our networks, such as research data, training materials, and company memos, could potentially be very valuable to competitors and foreign governments alike. In order to safeguard this information, we require that all employees adhere to strict password and data encryption policies and complete a training course detailing steps to avoid theft or loss of company-issued physical assets, such as laptops and mobile phones. Employees who fail to comply with those policies and follow the steps described in the training course are compromising the security of the company's intellectual property and will face stern consequences.\n\nIf the statements above are all true, which of the following can properly be inferred on the basis of them?\n",

        "explanation": "Employees who fail to comply with the company's strict password and data encryption policies or who fail to follow the steps described in the training course are compromising the security of the company's intellectual property and will face stern consequences. Why?\n\n (such as research data, training materials, and company memos). If there was no way for competitors and foreign governments to use the company's laptops to access information stored on the company's networks, then theft or loss of those laptops would not compromise that information. In that case, requiring that employees complete the training course would NOT help the company safeguard the information stored on the its networks. Thus, it follows that \"competitors and foreign governments  be able to use the company's laptops to access information stored on its networks. (A) looks good.\n\n(B) We only know that the employees will face stern consequences if they fail to comply with the password and data encryption policies or fail to follow the steps described in the training course. We do NOT know what those consequences would be (i.e. reduction in pay or bonuses, loss of vacation time, demotion, etc.). (B) can be eliminated.\n\n(C) We know that the company's information would be valuable to foreign governments, but we don't know WHY. If at least one foreign government would use that information to somehow compete with the company, then (C) would be true. However, perhaps the governments will simply benefit from that information without competing with the company. For example, it is possible that a foreign government purchases products or services from the company and would NOT need to do so if the government had free access to the company's information. (C) can be eliminated.\n\n(D) We can't say whether employees who have not yet completed the training are  to have their assets stolen. Perhaps it is very unlikely that employees will have their assets stolen, even before completing the training. The training might simply decrease the already low probability of loss or theft. (D) can be eliminated.\n\n(E) If employees do in fact store such information on company-issued laptops and mobile phones, then the company would certainly want to avoid loss or theft of those assets. However, even if employees do not store ANY such information on those devices and simply use those devices to  sensitive information on the company's networks, the company would still want to protect those assets from loss or theft. We cannot infer choice (E) based on the information in the passage alone, so (E) must be eliminated.\n\nThis leaves choice (A) as the best option.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "The owner of a small convenience store observed that almost all customers paid with credit cards regardless of whether they had cash available, resulting in significant processing charges for the store. The owner began to add a fifty-cent charge to credit card purchases under two dollars, and during the following month, virtually all customers used cash for small purchases while continuing to use credit cards for larger purchases. Nonetheless, during the month after the charge was instated, the average dollar amount of each cash transaction was almost identical to the average dollar amount of each credit card transaction. \n\nThe information in the passage most strongly supports which of the following?  \n\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "- Initially all customers paid with credit cards \n- 50c charge was added to credit card purchases under two dollars.\n- All customers used cash for small purchases (presumably under 2 dollars) while continuing to use credit cards for larger purchases.\n- Still, average dollar amount of each cash transaction was almost identical to the average dollar amount of each credit card transaction\n\nThis is unexpected, right? All customer used cash for &lt; $2 purchases and card for &gt; $2 purchases then you would expect that avg dollar amount of cash transactions would be small but avg dollar amount of card transactions would be high. \nwhen would the two averages be almost same? When customer pay cash for some very high value purchases to average out the small purchases. \n\nSay avg dollar amount of all purchases is $8. \nWhen the purchase amount is less than $2, customers use cash. When it is higher, they use card. But some customers would need to make cash transactions of say $15 too to average out the small transactions so that the two averages are same.\n\nCash transactions: $1, $1.5, $1.8, $14.2, $14.5, $15\nCard transactions: $8, $8, $8, $8, $8, $8, $8, $8 \n\nThe two will have the same average.\n\nA. The average dollar amount spent by customers who did not have cash available was higher after the charge was instated than it had been beforehand.\n\t\nWe don't know anything about customers who did not have cash available. Did they spend more before or later, we don't know. All we know is that before, all customers used to pay by  card (the ones who had cash and the ones who didn't) and later all customers started paying small amounts by cash. \n\nB. After the charge was instated, customers who used cash for purchases totaling two dollars or more spent more, on average, than customers who used credit cards for these purchases.\n\nCorrect. Customers who used cash for higher transactions, spent more than those who used cards. As discussed above, there must have been $15 transactions to make up for the small &lt;$2 cash transactions.\n\t\nC. The average dollar amount spent in each cash transaction at the convenience store was lower after the charge was instated than beforehand.\n\nBefore, there were no cash transactions. If there were a few, we don't know their dollar amounts.\n\nD. A significant majority of purchases made at the convenience store during the month after the charge was instated were made using credit cards. \n\nCannot say. We know that the average dollar amount is same. Whether there were more cash transactions or card transactions, we don't know. \t\n\nE. Prior to the charge, the average amount spent on credit card transactions was higher than the average amount spent on cash transactions.\n\nPrior to charge, there were no cash transactions.

Since the distinction between fact and opinion is crucial on the GMAT, especially in Must Be True stimuli where the correct answer choice must satisfy the strict parameters of the Prove Test, it is important to analyze each claim as follows:\n\nEarlier observations showed a comet reservoir far out in the solar system, but recent observations cannot confirm this. (Fact)\nProfessor Burns interprets the recent observations as proof that the comet reservoir doesn’t exist. (Opinion)\nThe recent observations occurred under poor conditions. (Fact)\n\nNote the use of double negatives in the second sentence of the stimulus: According to Prof. Burns, “this non-confirmation is enough to show that the earlier observations are incorrect.” It is imperative to immediately simplify this statement by removing both negations and distill its meaning: Burns doesn’t believe there is a comet reservoir far out in our solar system. However, since the recent observations occurred under poor conditions, it would be reasonable to doubt their significance: while they cannot prove (or disprove) the existence of a comet reservoir either way, they certainly cast doubt on Professor Burns’s conclusion. In other words, such a reservoir could exist. This prephrase agrees with answer choice (C).\n\nAnswer choice (A): Whether the recent observations, if made under good conditions, would have provided conclusive evidence of a comet reservoir is impossible to know. Beware of hypotheticals and speculative claims when answering Must Be True questions: more often than not, such claims are impossible to prove.\n\nAnswer choice (B): Just because Professor Burns reached an invalid conclusion does not mean that the recent observations actually confirm the earlier ones, i.e. that a comet reservoir exists. As stated earlier, it is impossible to know from the information provided whether or not such a reservoir actually exists. This answer choice conflates fact and opinion, and is therefore incorrect.\n\nAnswer choice (C): This is the correct answer choice. All we know from the facts presented in the stimulus is that the recent observations do not provide a suitable basis for rejecting the earlier ones. Professor Burns, who believes otherwise, is clearly wrong in making her assessment. In other words, her claims about the implications of the recent observations is incorrect—a comet reservoir could exist (we just don’t know).\n\nAnswer choice (D): As with answer choice (A), we have a hypothetical, speculative claim that cannot be proven with absolute certainty. It is entirely possible, however unlikely, that if the recent observations had been made under good conditions, they would have been enough to disprove the earlier ones. \n\nAnswer choice (E): This answer choice contains an exaggeration (“worthless”) that cannot be substantiated with the information provided. Eliminate.",

Unfortunately, not all of the do-it-yourself instructions on the Internet are written as well as they should be.\n\nWhat the passage tells us is that there is a reduction in the revenue for home service technicians and an increase in the number of injuries caused by the people who have attempted home repairs themselves. The passage further mentions that this is because do-it yourself(diy) instructions are not as good as they should be. Our aim is to find which of the stated  options could be inferred from the passage.\n\nNow, let us analyze statements b and c.\n\nb) Most people who are injured while attempting home repairs have done so while following instructions found in free do-it-yourself instructions on the Internet.\n\nThe passage does mention that the do-it-yourself instructions are not up to mark. However, nowhere does the passage suggest that the instructions are wrongfully written or have some flaws which led to the increase in accidents. We cannot even be sure of whether those who met with accidents followed the instructions states in the diy manuals religiously. They could have committed some mistakes which might have led to accidents. Since, we cannot be completely sure of whether option b is true or not,  based on the information in the passage, this statement in clearly not the one we are looking for.\n\nNow, let us analyze option c.\n\nc) The overall sale of online do-it-yourself home repair instructions by home service technicians has not been equal to the loss of revenue the technicians have incurred due to free offerings of this sort of material.\n\nWe already know that the free sale of online diy home repair instructions has caused a decrease in revenue for home service technicians. Statement c tells us that home technicians also sell the diy home repair instructions online. However, even though they might sell these instructions online, the revenue generated by this sale would not be equal to the decrease in revenue due to free offerings. If these values were equal, then they would not have incurred any decrease in net revenue at all. They would have either faced a no profit-no loss situation or a profitable  earnings as their loss in revenue earned by home repair would have been negated by profit generated by online sale of diy instruction manuals. However, the passage mentions that there is a reduction in revenue for home technicians and hence, this statement can be inferred.\n\nHope this helps!

        "question": "In the industrialized nations, the last century has witnessed a shortening of the average workday from twelve hours or longer to less than eight hours. Mindful of this enormous increase in leisure time over the past century, many people assume that the same trend has obtained throughout history, and that, therefore, prehistoric humans must have labored incessantly for their very survival.\n\nWe cannot, of course, directly test this assumption. However, a study of primitive peoples of today suggests a different conclusion. The Mbuti of central Africa, for instance, spend only a few hours each day in hunting, gathering, and tending to other economic necessities. The rest of their time is spent as they choose. The implication is that the short workday is not peculiar to industrialized societies. Rather, both the extended workday of 1880 and the shorter workday of today are products of different stages of the continuing process of industrialization.\n\nWhich of the following inferences about industrialization is best supported by the passage above?\n\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "We are asked to come up with an inference about industrialization. From the passage, we can gather that in the earlier stages of industrialization that the world was in a century ago, longer working days were the norm. The number of hours required to work per day then progressively reduced as industrialization advanced. (\"...both the extended workday of 1880 and the shorter workday of today are products of different stages of the continuing process of industrialization\").\n\nLet us examine the answer options:\n\n(A) People in advanced industrialized societies have more leisure time than those in nonindustrialized societies. \n\n(B) An average workday of twelve hours or more is peculiar to economies in the early stages of industrialization. \n\n(C) Industrialization involves a trade-off between tedious, monotonous jobs and the benefits of increased leisure. \n\n(D) It is likely that the extended workday of an industrializing country will eventually be shortened. \n\n(E) As industrialization progresses, people tend to look for self-fulfillment in leisure rather than work. \n\n\n\nHope this helps.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "Mystery stories often feature a brilliant detective and the detective’s dull companion. Clues are presented in the story, and the companion wrongly infers an inaccurate solution to the mystery using the same clues that the detective uses to deduce the correct solution. Thus, the author’s strategy of including the dull companion gives readers a chance to solve the mystery while also diverting them from the correct solution.\n\nWhich one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "The thing is that \"most\" has a formal logical meaning: it means \"more than 50%.\" Therefore, unless we can clarify that more than half of all the mystery stories in the world match the description in the stimulus, we can't choose (A). \n\nFor example, it would be acceptable to say that \"NBA players are often over 7 feet in height.\" There certainly are a lot more 7+ feet people in the NBA than in the regular population! However, it would be inaccurate to say that \"most NBA players are over 7 feet in height,\" since the majority of players aren't. \n\nSimilarly, if you see the word \"most\" in a stimulus, it gives you a lot of information. If I tell you that \"Most race-car drivers have one-syllable names,\" you can deduce that \"There are more race-car drivers with one-syllable names than there are with three-syllable names.\" It's a very powerful word! \n\nNotice the word \"some\" in the correct answer choice. This is exactly the kind of word you're looking for in an Inference Question (much like the equally good word, \"can\"). The only formal logical definition of \"some\" is \"more than zero,\" so as long as we have evidence that one such mystery story matches the description above (we do know this much from the stimulus), it's acceptable. \n\nTakeaways: \n\n1) The words \"some\" and \"can\" imply any number, one or more. That's all they imply, so they give very little information if they appear in the stimulus, and are very commonly found in right answers on Inference questions. \n\n2) The word \"most\" implies greater than half, so if it appears in the stimulus, it tells you a lot, and if it appears in an answer choice, it needs specific evidence to support it. \n\n3) The words \"often\" and \"many\" don't really have any formal definition -- don't ascribe to them anything beyond the meaning of \"some.\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t | \n\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n\n |  |  |  |  |  |",

        "question": "Studies have shown that a large percentage of car accidents are caused by aggressive driving. To help reduce the number of accidents and to promote traffic safety in general, insurance companies have begun to issue discounts to drivers who take defensive driving courses. Research shows that people who practice defensive driving are considerably less likely to get into a car accident. Therefore, the insurance company’s plan should help reduce the number of accidents. \n\nAssuming the statements above are true, which of the following can be inferred from them? \n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "GMATQuant25,\n\nIt looks like you are a GMAT Pill student. Let's go ahead and tackle this with Framework #8 Inference. In the process, you'll see the concept from Framework #4 Negation play a role as well.\n\nFramework #8 Inference\n\nSo you immediately you identify this question as an INFERENCE question. That means, do not be confused and take an answer choice and try to make it support the conclusion that is mentioned in the last line of the passage. That would be WRONG. If you did that, you're finding an ASSUMPTION -- not an INFERENCE.\n\nSo with inference questions, you take an answer choice -- and you ask why is that statement true? Is it true because... (then some detail in passage that might support THAT answer choice as being a valid conclusion --- as opposed to a valid assumption).\n\nLet's look at (C)\n\nC. Young males and other demographics known for disproportionately being involved in car accidents are less likely to practice defensive driving than other demographics. \n\nWhy would that be a valid conclusion? How do we know that....\"guys and those who get into car accidents are LESS likely to practice defensive driving?\n\nThe reason is because...\n\nAnything from passage to help us out? Well the passage doesn't talk about \"young males\".  But it does have something about the types of people that get into car accidents. Well, it talks about those who get into FEWER accidents -- hmm that must be the negated version since the argument was about those who got into MORE accidents. Let's elaborate.\n\nNow, negation is an important concept on GMAT CR. So immediately, you should think...can I use the negated example from the passage to support my claim?\n\nSo what is in the passage? Can it be said to be the \"negated\" form that would actually help support the claim?\n\nWell, passage says those who DO practice are LESS likely to get into accidents.\nSo let's rewrite that:\n\nThose in accidents a lot do not practice defensive driving\n DO Practice defensive driving =&gt; LESS likely in accidents\n\nWe know with Framework #4 Negation -- one method of supporting the argument is by showing the negation of that argument to be true. In this case, that's exactly what we do.\n\nWe take this basis (sourced from passage) and we negate it.\n DO Practice defensive driving =&gt; LESS likely in accidents\n DO NOT practice defensive driving =&gt; MORE likely in accidents.\n\nOK, does his negation support the argument?\n\n Those in accidents A LOT do NOT practice defensive driving (answer choice C)\n Those who DO NOT practice defensive driving =&gt; MORE likely in accidents.\n\n\n\n(C) says some group that gets into A LOT of accidents does not practice. In other words, these types of people do NOT practice and get into A LOT of accidents. This is exactly what our negated basis is helping us say.\n\nThus we managed to take information in the passage (\"practice defensive driving =&gt;less likely in accidents\")\nand use that to support our inferred statement (those who \"DO NOT Practice defensive driving =&gt; MORE likely in accidents\") by negating the basis found in the passage and observing how it SUPPORTS the claim made in answer choice (C).",

But the cartilaginous skeleton puzzles them, since no known eel possesses one. So scientists are still unsure as to the fish's precise classification, but they agreed immediately that the most logical classification would be as either a shark or an eel.\n\nThe statements above, if true, most strongly support which of the following?\n\n",

More importantly, not everyone is necessarily entitled to , but everyone should be entitled to .\n\nConsidering the statements made in the passage above very carefully, which of the following may be inferred?\n\n\n(A) Criticism that is worded as opinion can be both appropriate and effective, because it provides the pretense of opinion while still effecting a change.\n\n(B) Criticism and opinion are often confused with one another, because some mistake a negative opinion for criticism.\n\n(C) Opinion is simply the phase of thought before one reaches criticism, so there is often not a clear distinction between the two.\n\n(D) Positive, or constructive, criticism is equivalent to opinion, so all are entitled to share constructive criticism.\n\n(E) The freedom of speech and of thought guarantees that all are allowed opinions, so government cannot and should not restrict the sharing of opinions.\n\n \n\nQuestion presents a passage in which the student must consider the contrast between criticism and opinion. The passage begins by noting that a distinction must be made between criticism and opinion and then continues with an explanation of this distinction, concluding that criticism is not necessarily everyone’s right to have or share but that opinion cannot be denied. The question then asks for the answer choice that can be inferred from the passage. An inference from a passage, of course, is not an outright statement of the passage, but an inference does  on direct statements; therefore, the correct answer choice will be derived from specific comments made in the passage.\n\n\n\nB Answer choice (B) makes the following statement: “Criticism and opinion are often confused with one another, because some mistake a negative opinion for criticism.” The passage begins by noting that criticism and opinion need to be distinguished from one another, implying immediately that the distinction is not always made. Thus, the first part of answer choice (B) can be inferred from the passage. Additionally, the passage notes that people who criticize others are “hoping to effect a modification” in behavior and that criticism generally has a negative connotation. Although the author of the passage notes that opinion does not always have a negative connotation, if the opinion is itself negative such a connotation may be derived. From this, the student can correctly assume that a negative opinion is often confused for criticism, thus explaining the confusion that was stated in the first sentence of the passage. Answer choice (B) is correct.\n\n\n\nA Although the passage begins with the implication that criticism and opinion are often confused with one another, there is no mention in the passage of , nor can this inference be derived from any of the statements made in the passage. The author does note the difference between the  behind criticism versus opinion, but the author makes no recommendation about offering criticism in such a way that it would be welcome. Answer choice (A) has no support in the passage and is thus incorrect.\n\nC Clearly, the passage implies that people make the mistake of confusing opinion with criticism, but the passage does not mention phases of thought at any point, nor does the passage indicate that opinion is connected to criticism because of these phases of thought. In fact, the author notes quite clearly that criticism and opinion need to be distinguished from one another, suggesting that they are not related and thus cannot be connected by phases of thought. Answer choice (C) is incorrect.\n\nD The author makes no mention of , instead discussing criticism as a whole rather than in separate forms. Answer choice (D) assumes information that is not in the passage, so it can be eliminated.\n\nE Although the passage might very well go on to discuss the right to opinion as a component of freedom of speech, there is no such implication in the passage at this point, nor can such an idea be assumed merely from the information the passage provides. The author mentions only that “everyone should be entitled to ,” but within the context of the passage this relates more to the purpose behind opinion rather than to abstract freedoms. Answer choice (E) is incorrect.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

By contrast,  is a detail, a throwaway mention, not vital to the argument overall.

        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "One thing we can be pretty sure of is that when the makers of the LSAT (lawyers, academics—a very button-down crowd) refer to a “New Age philosopher,” they are probably going to make that person look stupid. This question doesn’t disappoint.\n\nThe argument is basically, “Because nature is organic, holistic, and nonlinear we must use organic, holistic, and nonlinear methods to understand it.” This is\nsimilar to saying, “Because the Earth is round, we must use  methods to understand the Earth,” or, “Because grass is , we should use green methods to understand grass.” This makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nThe question asks us to find grounds for criticizing the New Age philosopher’s argument. I think I’ve already done a decent job, above. Generally my objection is\nsomething like, “The characteristics of the methods you use to study something don’t have to match the characteristics of the thing itself.”\n\nA) This would be a flaw, but it’s not the flaw that’s present in  argument.\n\nB) This almost exactly matches our prediction.\n\nC) This is like, “The Giants are good, therefore Aaron Rowand must also be good.” That’s definitely a flaw (Aaron Rowand sucks) but it’s not the same flaw the argument actually made.\n\nD) This is ridiculous. Since we already like B, we can’t waste time with this.\n\nE) Oops. This one is also very close to our prediction. After rereading B, I like E a lot better. B says “overall structure,” where E is closer to the given argument with “certain properties.” Also E is talking about the methods that should be used to get the best understanding, which is on target, whereas B is talking about “the reasoning [commonly? usually?] done about a phenomenon.” I like E better than B, and the rest of the answers are terrible, so our answer is E. This question is a great example of why we need to read all five answer choices.

        "question": "Commentator: Advocates of direct cash assistance payments to individuals have long asserted that such payments, from either local or federal funds, are an effective way to build wealth among working people who struggle to accumulate capital while meeting basic expenses. Clearly, however, this assertion has proven false. In a recent two-year pilot program, most recipients of direct cash assistance reported that they spent all of the additional funds on immediate expenses. Even among those who did save, few set aside more than 10% of the funds in savings or retirement accounts. \n\nThe commentator’s argument is flawed in that it \n\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Official Explanation:\n\n \n\nThe word flawed in the question stem indicates that this is a Find the Flaw question.\n\n \n\nIn this argument, the conclusion is hidden in the middle. First, the commentator describes someone else’s opinion—a counterpoint. Advocates have said that giving people cash will build wealth. The commentator concludes that this view is wrong, then provides a supporting premise: People who received cash assistance put only a small percentage into savings or retirement accounts. \n\n\n \nSince this is a Find the Flaw question, the answer will relate to an assumption the argument relies upon. Here are two big ones the commentator seems to be making:\n\n\nAny argument relying on a study or sample is relying on the idea that this result is not an outlier, but that can be a little too simple and direct to make a tricky GMAT answer. However, the results could be unrepresentative in more subtle ways. For instance, maybe two years is not long enough to see the effect that advocates of cash assistance have predicted. The commentator is assuming that if any wealth-building was going to happen, it would happen within the first two years. \n\nNext, there other ways to build wealth: paying down credit card debt, building home equity, paying for college.\n\nOne more feature to consider: On Find the Flaw questions, some of the answers may describe an assumption the argument relies upon, while others may describe a weakness that the argument fails to address. The answers may also directly describe the commentator’s error in logic.\n\nIn this case, choices (A), (C), and (E) are all trying to describe assumptions. The terms  and  are synonyms for . On the other hand, (B) and (D) directly describe logical errors. (None of the answers in this set are weakeners. That language would be something along the lines of  or .)\n\n\n\n(A) This is not a necessary assumption. The conclusion addresses only one claim made by the advocates: whether this assistance will create wealth. The argument doesn’t address what other criteria might be used to judge the success of the program.\n\n(B) The argument mentions only  and . It does not address whether those expenses are essential or discretionary.\n\n(C) Watch out for the trap! This would be a great answer if it began with  or , thereby indicating a weaken answer. If individuals were likely to shift to saving the assistance funds in a longer-term program, that would weaken the argument. However, the language  means . The commentator isn’t assuming this at all. If anyone is making this assumption, it’s the advocates described in the first sentence!\n\n If the argument  two things, it treats them as the same. The commentator assumes that since the assistance didn’t  to wealth (more money in savings now), it also didn’t indirectly contribute to building wealth in some other way. But if, for example, someone paid down credit card debt, they would reduce their future interest payments—one way to build future wealth. Alternatively, if they invested in education, they might be able to get a higher-paying job, another way to build future wealth.\n\n(E) When the language is abstract, fill it in with the applicable terms from the argument. The  is cash assistance and the  that follows is spending on immediate expenses (rather than saving). So this is saying that the commentator has assumed that recipients would not have spent so much if they hadn’t received the assistance. This isn’t a necessary assumption. Because the commentator’s conclusion is about the accumulation of wealth, the argument is not affected by whether people would have spent less without cash assistance. It doesn’t matter  they spent the money; it only matters whether that spending contributed to wealth creation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

It has been found that people who use the supplement to lose weight are more prone to panic attacks than people who lose weight through dietary changes only. Clearly, the supplement causes panic attacks.\n\nThe argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which of the following grounds?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "for the  in \n    \n\n Official Explanation:\n\nThe author bases the conclusion on a comparison. The people who use the supplement to lose weight are more prone to panic attacks than people who lose weight through dietary changes.\n\nSo, even if it is the case that weight loss itself causes an increase in tendency to have panic attacks, we still have the fact that people are more prone to panic attacks when they use the supplement to support the conclusion that the supplement causes panic attacks.\n\nSo, the argument works regardless of whether it considers the possibility that weight loss itself causes an increase in tendency to have panic attacks since that existence or nonexistence of that possibility doesn’t affect the strength of the argument.\n\n\n\nNotice that the author bases the conclusion on a comparison. The people who use the supplement to lose weight are more prone to panic attacks than people who lose weight through dietary changes. So, everyone is losing weight, but the people who use the supplement have more panic attacks.\n\nThus, even if panic attacks do cause people to lose weight, it is still the case that people who use the supplement are MORE prone to panic attacks. So, the author doesn’t  have to have done what this choice says in making the argument. Even without ruling out the possibility that panic attacks cause people to lose weight, the author could still make the same argument.\n\n\n\nThe author bases the conclusion on a comparison. The people who use the supplement to lose weight are more prone to panic attacks than people who lose weight through dietary changes.\n\nBecause of that difference in outcomes, the author concludes that the supplement causes panic attacks.\n\nHowever, it’s also possible that the difference in outcomes exists for another reason. It could be that dietary changes cause a reduction in panic attacks. After all, if dietary changes cause a reduction in panic attacks, then the same difference in outcomes would exist, except it would exist for a different reason. People who use the supplement would be more prone to panic attacks because they didn’t have the benefit of the dietary changes to reduce their tendencies to have panic attacks.\n\nSo, we can see that, in arriving at the conclusion, the author does what this choice says.\n\n\n\nThe author bases the conclusion on a comparison. The people who use the supplement to lose weight are more prone to panic attacks than people who lose weight through dietary changes only. \n\nNotice that, even if people who use the supplement to lose weight also use dietary changes the argument still works because the point still stands that the people who use the supplement  are more prone to panic attacks than people who use dietary changes alone.\n\n\n\nNotice that the argument concludes that the supplement causes panic attacks whereas this choice suggests basically the opposite, that people who have already experienced panic attacks choose to use the supplement for some reason.\n\nSo, this choice says, basically, that the argument assumes the opposite of what it concludes.

        "question": "Until recently it was thought that ink used before the sixteenth century did not contain titanium. However, a new type of analysis detected titanium in the ink of the famous Bible printed by Johannes Gutenberg and in that of another fifteenth-century Bible known as B-36, though not in the ink of any of numerous other fifteenth-century books analyzed. This finding is of great significance, since it not only strongly supports the hypothesis that B-36 was printed by Gutenberg but also shows that the presence of titanium in the ink of the purportedly fifteenth century Vinland Map can no longer be regarded as a reason for doubting the map's authenticity.\n\nThe reasoning in the passage is vulnerable to criticism on the ground that\n\n",

        "explanation": "The argument has nothing to do with the  of the B-36 and Vinland Map, so choice (D) is not relevant.\n\nInstead, the argument is based the following analysis: \"a new type of analysis detected titanium in the ink of the famous Bible printed by Johannes Gutenberg and in that of another fifteenth-century Bible known as B-36, though not in the ink of any of numerous other fifteenth-century books analyzed.\"\n\nPrior to that analysis, \"it was thought that ink used before the sixteenth century did not contain titanium.\" As a result, PRIOR to the analysis, \"the presence of titanium in the ink of the purportedly fifteenth century Vinland Map\" was regarded as a reason for doubting the map's authenticity.\n\nThe author interprets the analysis by saying that, since titanium was found in two pre-sixteenth-century bibles, it must be possible for titanium to be present in the ink of various other pre-sixteenth century documents (such as the Vinland Map). Thus, even though it contains titanium ink, it is possible that the Vinland Map was created before the sixteenth century. This reasoning is based on the notion that, even though only found in two documents, usage of titanium in ink was possible in VARIOUS pre-sixteenth-century documents (i.e. the usage was NOT restricted).\n\nBut the author also concludes that the analysis \"strongly supports the hypothesis that B-36 was printed by Gutenberg.\" The author concludes that, since use of titanium was so restricted before the 16th century, it is likely that any pre-sixteenth century document containing titanium ink was printed by Gutenberg. This reasoning is based on the notion that the usage of titanium in ink WAS restricted; otherwise, the presence of titanium in ink could not be used as evidence to support that Gutenberg was the printer.\n\nThus, the author uses two contradictory lines of reasoning, as described in choice (A).\n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

Furthermore, there is overwhelming historical evidence that only a party that has at least 30 percent of eligible voters prepared to support it by either joining it or donating money to it is viable in the long run. Therefore, it is unlikely that an education party is viable in the long run.\n\nThe reasoning in the journalist’s argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument fails to consider that\n",

But it’s possible that there are zero people who like both the Giants and the A’s. If that’s true, then there are actually 50 percent total baseball fans in the Bay Area, which makes the conclusion totally wrong.\n\nSame thing is happening with the journalist’s argument. 26 percent would join, and 16 percent would donate. The journalist assumes that the people who would donate would also join! But if these are actually two entirely separate groups, then there are 42 percent who would join  donate, which means the party could be viable.\n\nA) No, it’s not about whether people would  donate. The requirement was that supporters have to be “prepared to join or donate.” Also, this doesn’t match our prediction. I’m looking for something about .\n\nB) No way in hell. This answer is a big time cheat. It basically says, “Oh yeah? Well, the rules might not apply in this case.” Saying that wouldn’t ruin the journalist’s logical position. The journalist would just come back with, “Yeah, well, I didn’t claim that the rules  apply, I just said that history makes it  the party is going to succeed.”\n\nC) This is a trap. You must stay connected to the facts that are presented! Like B, this one changes the rules. This one says, “I know that historically a certain percentage of  are necessary, but in this special case maybe my donors are going to donate more per person, which means my party will be an exception to the rule.” The journalist could reply to this with, “Well sure, maybe you’re special. But my logical position, based on facts and history, is still valid.” Be wary of answer choices that seem to ignore or avoid the premises of the argument.\n\nD) Who gives a **** how many people \"support the idea\" of an education party? Even if it's 100 percent, we still might not have the 30 percent who will actually join or donate.\n\nE) Yep. This one says, “Hey wait a minute!

Therefore, if the press agent told every reporter everything about the accident, then no reporter knows any more about it than any other reporter. If no reporter knows any more about the accident than any other reporter, then no reporter can scoop all of the other reporters. However, the press agent did not tell every reporter everything about the accident. It follows that some reporter can scoop all of the other reporters.\n\nThe argument's reasoning is flawed because the argument fails to recognize that which one of the following is consistent with the facts the argument presents?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "This argument sets up the press agent as a gatekeeper of information. The ONLY way for reporters to get information about an accident is through the press agent. So, if the press agent tells   of the info, then no reporter can scoop the other reporters (scoop means to report information first). \n\nHowever, the press agent did NOT tell everyone all of the info. From this, the author concludes that \"some reporter can scoop all of the other reporters.\"\n\nNotice that the argument doesn't tell us what the press agent actually DID tell the reporters. Did he/she treat the reporters fairly and at least give them all the  info? Or did he/she pull one reporter aside and give that reporter more info than the rest of the reporters received? In the first scenario, no reporter could scoop the other reporters, and the author's argument falls apart. In the second scenario, the reporter who received more information CAN scoop the other reporters, just as the author argues.\n\nThe question asks us to identify the situation that is consistent with the argument and shows a flaw in the author's reasoning. In other words, which answer choice shows us a possible situation in which some reporter could NOT scoop the other reporters?\n\nHere's (E):\nThis points out the flaw we identified above. Sure, the press agent didn't give ALL of the reporters ALL of the information. But that doesn't mean that the press agent gave one reporter more information than everyone else. Maybe the press agent just gave ALL of the reporters the same, information. Then, all of the reporters would be on the same playing field, and \"no reporter [would know] any more about the accident than any other reporter,\" as stated in (E). \n\nThis is entirely consistent with the info in the passage, and would prevent some reporter from scooping the other reporters. That's why (E) is the correct answer. \n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

Mr Diaz, a teacher at school is excellent too. Then we cannot say that he must be a part of the conducting faculty. This is a flaw but not the same flaw. We are not assuming that a group character is applicable to an individual member too. We are given that Mr Diaz is excellent.

        "question": "People with a certain medical condition tend to have lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) before they are diagnosed with this condition than do people without this condition. This association is equally strong whether or not the individuals have taken medications to lower their LDL-C. Therefore, having taken such medications does not make it more likely that people with lower LDL-C will develop the condition in question.\n\nThe doctor’s argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which of the following grounds?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of the argument is the following:\n\n\n\nThe reasoning of the argument is basically that, since the association between having low LDL-C and being diagnosed with the condition is the same regardless of whether people have taken medications to lower LDL-C, the medications don't help to cause people to develop the condition.\n\n\n\nThis question is a Logical Flaw question, and the correct answer will describe an aspect of the argument that's a flaw.\n\n\n\nThe choice perfectly describes a flaw in the argument.\n\nAfter all, the argument uses one premise, that the association betwen LDL-C and the condition is the same regardless whether the person experiencing the condition used medications, to support the conclusion that medications do not help to cause the condition.\n\nThat the argument does so is a flaw because, even if medications don't affect that particular assoication, they could still cause the condition. After all, they could cause the condition without affecting that association. So, the fact that medications don't change that association doesn't necessarily mean that they don't help to cause the condtion.\n\nThus, we could say that, in presuming that if medications do not strengthen the association, they don't help to cause the condition, the argument makes an unwarranted assumption.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThis choice is incorrect because the argument simply doesn't do what this choice says.\n\nAfter all, the argument doesn't mention the effects of the condition and doesn't confuse the effects of medications with the effects of the condition. Rather, it keeps clear the effects of medications, which are to lower LDL-C and, possibly, to help cause the disease.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nLet's break this choice down to see why its incorrect:\n\n\n\nThe only factor that the passage mentions as not being known to cause an effect is \"taking medications,\" which the passage claims \"does not make it more likely that people with lower LDL-C will develop the condition in question.\"\n\nOn the other hand, \"taking medications\" to lower LDL-C would obviously be known to cause \"low levels\" of LDL-C.\n\n\n\nThe only two \"associated\" effects mentioned in the passage are the \"condition\" and \"low levels\" of LDL-C., and \"the first\" would be the one that \"taking medications\" is not known to cause, meaning \"another effect\" must be \"low levels\" of LDL-C.\n\nSo, let's now translate this choice to make it specifically about this passage.\n\n\n\nHaving translated the choice, we see that it basically says that the argument takes for granted that \"taking medications\" does not cause \"low levels\" of LDL-C.\n\nSince, clearly, the passage does not say or imply that taking LDL-C lowering medications does not cause low levels of LDL-C, this choice is incorrect.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nIt's true that the argument does not address the possibility that, even if medications do not cause the condition, medications and the condition may be associated.\n\nAt the same time, the fact that the argument does not address that possibility is not a flaw in the argument. After all, as long as medications do not cause the condition, the conclusion is correct, regardless of whether medications and the condition are strongly associated.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is incorrect because the argument doesn't take for granted, i.e., assume, that the association between low LDL-C and the condition holds when medications are present. Rather, it states as fact that \"this association is equally strong whether or not the individuals have taken medications to lower their LDL-C.\"\n\nSomething the argument states as fact is not something the argument takes for granted, or assumes.\n\nEliminate.\n\n A­",

        "question": "Johan: Global warming has been sold to the general population as a serious threat, but in reality there is very little scientific proof that the earth is experiencing anything more than normal climate change over long periods of time. There is scientific truth to the argument that the climate is changing and that the earth is slightly warmer now than it was several decades ago, but there is no proof that this is due to human activity or to environmental pollutants. In reality, the earth experiences gradual climate shifts that result in warmer and cooler climates. We are currently in one of those shifts.\n\nAndrian: It is impossible to believe that governments would spend billions of dollars on research to prevent global warming if it were scientifically proven to be a case of normal climate change. Most scientists seem to agree that the earth’s climate is changing, and given the output of pollution from mankind, it stands to reason that the pollution has effected some climate change.\n\nWhich of the following best characterizes Andrian’s response to Johan’s argument?\n\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Question presents a conversation between Johan and Andrian about global warming. Johan argues that global warming is essentially a normal feature of climate change and that the earth experiences such climate shifts periodically. He claims that human actions and environmental pollution have not caused global warming and that the earth is simply going through an expected climate change. Andrian responds by claiming that if scientists really recognized global warming to be a normal feature of climate change, governments would not be spending so much money on preventing global warming. Andrian goes on to say that since the earth’s climate is changing, and man has been releasing an increasing rate of pollution into the environment, it stands to reason that the argument about man’s contribution to global warming is correct. The student is then asked to identify which of the answer choices best characterizes Andrian’s response to Johan. The student should recognize at once that Andrian’s response to Johan has very little substance to it. He initially disagrees with Johan but then uses a circular argument to explain his point. What is more, he does not address any of Johan’s primary points of support and, as a result, his (Andrian’s) argument makes little sense as a response to Johan. While the question itself does not necessarily point to identifying a flaw in Andrian’s reasoning, the correct answer will need to reflect this failure on Andrian’s part.\n\n\n\nC Answer choice (C) accurately explains Andrian’s response and the problem with it: he disagrees with Johan but does absolutely nothing to target and undermine Johan’s points of support. Answer choice (C), therefore, is correct.\n\n\n\nA At no point does Andrian attack Johan personally, and there is not part of his response that could be perceived as a personal attack, so answer choice (A) must be incorrect.\n\nB Andrian relies on virtually no evidence to back up his line of reasoning, and while this in itself could be deemed faulty, it cannot be said that he actually relies on faulty evidence. Answer choice (B) is also incorrect and may be eliminated.\n\nD Andrian does focus on disagreeing with Johan, but Johan’s argument is not divided into two parts, so it cannot be said that Andrian focuses on one part but ignores the second part. Johan’s argument is a single statement about man’s contribution to global warming, and Andrian only focuses on disputing Johan’s point that man has had no part in it (with no supporting evidence on Andrian’s part except for a hypothetical statement that governments would not spend money on something nonexistent). Answer choice (D) is \nincorrect.\n\nE Again, Johan’s argument is not actually divided into two parts: it is a single argument with several points of support. So Andrian cannot be said to attack the secondary part and overlook the main part. Answer choice (E) is also incorrect.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "Recently discovered fossil evidence casts doubt on the evolutionary theory that dinosaurs are more closely related to reptiles than to other classes of animals. Fossils show that some dinosaurs had hollow bones-a feature found today only in warm-blooded creatures, such as birds, that have a high metabolic rate. Dinosaurs had well-developed senses of sight and hearing, which is not true of present-day cold-blooded creatures like reptiles. The highly arched mouth roof of some dinosaurs would have permitted them to breathe while eating, as fast-breathing animals, such as birds, need to do. Today, all fast-breathing animals are warm-blooded. Finally, fossils reveal that many dinosaurs had a pattern of growth typical of warm-blooded animals. \n\nThe argument in the passage proceeds by \n\n",

        "explanation": "Here is a great explanation from from David@VeritasPrep - GMAT Instructor\n\n\"This question is from the October 1993 LSAT the first Logical Reasoning Section, number 11. \n\nThis is a method of reasoning question, it asks you to describe how the argument proceeds. This is a type of question that does appear on the GMAT and is one of the \"m\"s in the Veritas SWIMMER method. \n\nMethod of reasoning questions are some of the best questions to study to improve your overall critical reasoning skills. They help you to understand how arguments are structured - how they are supposed to lead to their conclusion. \n\n\nYou can start this type of question as you would any \"normal' - meaning not inference and paradox. So start by identifying the conclusion. In this case the conclusion comes at the very beginning of the argument. This would be rare for a GMAT question! So the conclusion is \n\n\"Recently discovered fossil evidence casts doubt on the evolutionary \ntheory that dinosaurs are more closely related to reptiles than to \nother classes of animals.\" \n\nNow we want to look to the evidence for this conclusion. The rest of the passage is really the evidence - several examples of things that are not true of present-day reptiles and are true of present day birds and other warm-blooded animals. \n\nSo that is what the argument is doing - arguing for a conclusion about a type of animal that is long extinct by comparing that type to two current types of animals. \n\nThis is what answer choice E says, \"presenting evidence that a past phenomenon is more similar to one \nrather than the other of two present-day phenomena.\" Please do not get caught up in the term phenomenon. On the GMAT and the LSAT the word phenomenon has very little real meaning - it only means a thing or an event. \n\nIn this case the past phenomenon is dinosaurs and the present phenomena are warm-blooded creatures and cold-blooded creatures\".\n\nHe made the analysis so simple  <img src=\"https://cdn.gmatclub.com/cdn/files/forum/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\">",

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "To correctly answer this question, we need to find a choice that describes a flaw in the argument. The flaw will likely have something to do with how the conclusion is supported by the evidence.\n\nReviewing the argument, we see that the main conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for the conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nAn issue that can jumps out at us as we go from the support to the conclusion is that the support is that \"the report's assurances should be looked at critically,\" whereas the conclusion is that the belief that irradiating food to kill bacteria makes it less wholesome \"appears to be well-founded.\"\n\nThe issue with that evidence being used to support that conclusion is that the evidence casts doubt on assurances that the belief is NOT TRUE whereas the conclusion is that the belief is well founded, in other words, basically, that the belief IS TRUE.\n\nSimply put, the author uses the fact that we haven't proved the belief untrue to support the conclusion that it is true. Of course, the fact that we haven't proved something untrue doesn't mean that it's well founded. For example, I doubt that anyone has ever demonstrated that tickling an alligator with a feather won't make it laugh, but that fact certainly does not make the belief that tickling an alligator with a feather will make it laugh well founded.\n\nNow, let's go to the answer choices.\n\n\n\nThis choice accurately describes something the argument does, but the fact that the argument does what this choice describes is not a flaw. After all, it's not illogical to conclude that the report's assurances should be viewed with caution given the fact that the report's author may be biased.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe argument does not address the possibility mentioned by this choice, but its failing to address that possibility is not a flaw. After all, even if there are segments of the food industry that desire that irradiation be seen negatively by the public, it's still the case that the people who created the report mentioned in the argument were biased. In other words, other people's desires don't somehow make the report reliable.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is clearly incorrect because the people whose motivations the author mentions and the people the author bases his presumptions about those motivations on are the same people. In other words, the sample and the people with the motivations are the same, meaning there cannot possibly be an issue with the sample.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice may not quickly jump out as correct, but if we look at it carefully we see that it is.\n\nAs we discussed above, there is an issue with the argument in that the conclusion that the belief is well founded is based on the support that assurances that it is not true came from biased people. Reviewing this choice, we can see that it describes that exact issue, using different wording. Let's see how:\n\nconcludes that a position is well supported -&gt; concludes that a belief is well founded\n\nbecause some who have rejected that position may have been biased -&gt; because assurances that that belief is not true come from biased people\n\nSo, this choice perfectly captures the flaw in the argument.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nIt's true that the argument does not \"address the possibility that irradiation may not be advisable even if the specific worries the public has had about it are ill-founded.\"\n\nHowever, the fact that the argument does not address that possibility is not a flaw. After all, the matter of that possibility is irrelevant to this argument which is about only the belief that irradiating food to kill bacteria makes it less wholesome.\n\nEliminate.\n\nThe correct answer is (D).",

        "question": "Jane: Professor Harper’s ideas for modifying the design of guitars are of no value because there is no general agreement among musicians as to what a guitar should sound like and, consequently, no widely accepted basis for evaluating the merits of a guitar’s sound.\n\nMark: What’s more, Harper’s ideas have had enough time to be adopted if they really resulted in superior sound. It took only ten years for the Torres design for guitars to be almost universally adopted because of the improvement it makes in tonal quality. Which one of the following most accurately describes the relationship between Jane’s argument and Mark’s argument?\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic, edited the question and added the OA.",
        "explanation": "OA is E.\n\nThis is one of the greatest Method of Reasoning questions of all time. First take a close look at the statements made by Jane and Mark. In the majority of GMAT questions with two speakers—one identifiably male and the other identifiably female—the male makes a mistake or an error of reasoning and the female uses sound reasoning. This does not occur in every problem, but it occurs enough to be more than random. Why? The thinking goes that in order for GMAC to protect themselves against accusations that they are biased against women, they create problems where the male is clearly the one using faulty reasoning. Jane’s position: Jane concludes that Professor Harper’s ideas are valueless because there is no way to evaluate a guitar sound and determine what constitutes a better-sounding guitar. Mark’s position: Mark also agrees that Professor Harper’s ideas are valueless, but Mark’s reasoning is that if Harper’s ideas really worked, then they would have been adopted by now. In making this analysis, Mark reveals that he believes there is a way to determine that one guitar sounds better than another. Like all GMAT questions, you must lock down the exact nature of the premises and conclusions! Mark’s initial comment of “What’s more” leads most people to believe he is in complete agreement with Jane. Yes, he agrees with her conclusion, but his reason for doing so is completely contrary to Jane’s reason. Mark actually misinterprets Jane’s claim, and this is why he says “What’s more,” as if he is adding an additional piece of information that supports her position. He is not; the premise that he uses contradicts Jane’s premises. If you simply accept “What’s more” to mean that he is in complete agreement with Jane, you will most certainly miss the question, and have no idea you have done so. The problem becomes even more challenging because the answer choices are brilliantly constructed: \n\nAnswer choice (A): Mark does not address a weakness in Jane’s argument or show how one could be overcome. Do not mistake the use of “What’s more” to automatically mean that he is adding something helpful to the situation. \n\nAnswer choice (B): This is an answer chosen by many people, and it has Shell game aspects. Mark’s argument does not have a premise in common with Jane’s argument; rather, Mark’s argument has the conclusion in common with Jane’s argument. Before you select this answer, use the Fact Test and ask yourself, “Which premise do the two arguments have in common?” You won’t be able to find one, and that would instantly disprove the answer. \n\nAnswer choice (C): This is a very clever Reverse Answer choice. The answer states: “Mark and Jane use similar techniques to argue for different conclusions.” In fact, the following happens in the stimulus: “Mark and Jane use different techniques to argue for similar conclusions.” If you had any doubt that the makers of the GMAT put the same amount of work into the wrong answers as the correct answers, this answer choice should be convince you that they do. \n\nAnswer choice (D): An argument is the sum of the premises and conclusion. Although Mark restates Jane’s conclusion, he does not restate her premises. Therefore, he does not restate her argument and this answer is incorrect. \n\nAnswer choice  This is another great example of a separator question: one that scorers in a certain range will get and scorers in a lower range will not get.\n\nThis is also a dangerous question because many people think they have chosen the correct answer when in fact they have missed it. The lesson here is that you must be an active, prepared reader. Do not allow yourself to be lured by Mark’s comment of “What’s more” into believing that he automatically is in agreement with Jane. The test makers use that phrase to see if you will read closely enough to discern his real argument or if you will simply gloss over his comments on the basis of how they are introduced. The GMAT always makes you pay if you gloss over any section of a stimulus.",

        "explanation": "Yes, this certainly is a tough question. I will try to simplify it as much as I can. Lets see.\n\nWEAK Economy----&gt; CONSTANT Prices + INCREASED Unemployment\nOne has to be careful in interpreting the next statement-- \"Unemployment rises only if investment decreases\". What does this mean?\nIt means: If unemployment has risen then, the investment MUST have decreased.\nIt DOES NOT mean: Every decrease in investment will cause an increase in unemployment!\nSo, If INCREASED Unemployment, then DECREASED Investment. It is not the same thing as\nDECREASED Investment-----&gt; INCREASED Unemployment. This is where the confusion may have arisen! \nNow we can consider each choice individually.\n\nA  \"Either the economy is weak or the investment is decreasing\"\nWe know from the stimulus that the 2nd part of the statement is not true,i.e., the investment is not decreasing. Now we should examine the 1st part i.e., \"economy is weak\". Can economy be weak and investment not decrease? No, it cannot be true! If eco. is weak, Unemployment will rise. If unemployment has risen, then investment MUST have decreased. But investment is not decreasing. Therefore, unemployment has not risen. Hence, economy has not weakened.\n\nB  \"If unemployment rises then prices remain constant\". Is this possible? Yes, it is. There is no established relationship between unemployment and prices in the stimulus; nor is there any established relationship between investment and prices. So they can change independent of each other.\n\nC  \"The economy is weak only if investment decreases\". Could this be true? Yes.\nIn the stimulus, there is no established relationship between economy and investment. So one can assume this scenario:\n\nDECREASED Investment---&gt; WEAK Economy---&gt; CONSTANT Prices + INCREASED Unemployment.\n\nD  \"Either the economy is weak or the prices are remaining constant\". Is this possible?\nThe 1st part is not possible because if the economy is weak then, unemployment must rise and if unemployment has risen the, the investment must have decreased. But the stimulus tells us that investment has not decreased; so the economy has not weakened.\nHow about the 2nd part, i.e., \"prices are remaining constant\"? There is no established relationship in the stimulus between prices and investment. Therefore, this scenario is possible.\n\nE  \"Either unemployment is rising or the economy is not weak\". Could any of this be true?\nYes. The 1st part cannot be true since the investment has not decreased. The 2nd part can be true.\n\nTherefore, according to me the Ans should be A.",

The conservative would disagree, but the socialist would not agree -- the socialist does not even agree that such arguments exist, so the question of whether those arguments are \"justified\" is a non-issue\n\n(D) cannot be correct. The conservative says that \"history occurs through accident, contingency, and individual struggle.\" The last part there indicates the conservative would agree with this answer. The socialist also thinks that socialists can change the world, so the socialist would agree with this answer as well. So both agree, and this cannot be the Point at Issue.\n\n(E) is the CORRECT ANSWER. Here is what the two disagree about. The conservative claims that socialists analyze history in order to find an inevitable trend toward socialism; the socialist counters that if socialists believed history were inevitable, they wouldn't try to change anything, so they obviously think their actions have an effect and history is not inevitable. So the socialist reason for analyzing history is NOT its inevitability. Phrased more simply, the conservative says \"This is why you analyze history\" and the socialist says \"We do analyze history, but for a different reason.\" So their disagreement is about why socialists do a certain thing, analyzing history.

Although many complain about government intervention in their lives, they tend not to reelect inactive politicians. But a politician’s activity consists largely in the passage of laws whose enforcement affects voters’ lives. Thus, voters often reelect politicians whose behavior they resent.\n\nWhich one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the claim that people tend not to reelect inactive politicians?\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "I understand the temptation for GMAT students to study LSAT problems, mostly because of the huge amount of official LSAT material available (there are almost a hundred full-length official LSATs, comprising over 10,000 questions in total, available for purchase).  \n\nIf you're going to use LSAT material, though, you should always ask yourself \"How would this problem work/look if it were on the GMAT?\"  Almost every LSAT problem would need some kind of 'adaptation' to be GMAT-relevant—if indeed it can be made relevant at all (lots of LSAT problems cannot).\n\n\n\nThis problem asks for the role played by one specific statement in an argument.  In this case, there's a ready analogue on the GMAT: the 'boldface statement' CR problem type.\n\nBut, even though the analogy is unusually close, the problem statement and answer choices don't look like their counterparts on the GMAT.  When you study this kind of problem, it's imperative to consider how to map it onto a GMAT-like template.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this problem, nothing is boldfaced; instead, the content of one sentence is repeated in the question 'stem'.\n\nThe GMAT would instead put that one sentence into boldface and remove the specs from the stem:\n\n. But a politician’s activity consists largely in the passage of laws whose enforcement affects voters’ lives. Thus, voters often reelect politicians whose behavior they resent.\n\nWhich one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the boldfaced statement?\n\n\n\n\nIn my experience, most students find it very helpful to  and , in language that wouldn't be out of place in educated but casual conversation.\nAlso, if your native language is other than English—and especially if most of your spoken conversations happen in that non-English language—you may find it helpful to translate the statements as you go (if you're able to do so fairly efficiently).\n\nIf you do these things, then you ought to find it much more intuitive to grasp that:\n• the FIRST statement (\"People’s political behavior frequently does not match their rhetoric\"—however you 'translate' this) is a GENERALITY;\n• the LAST statement (\"voters often reelect politicians whose behavior they resent\") is ONE EXAMPLE of that general principle;\n• the BOLDFACED statement (\"Although many complain about government intervention in their lives, they tend not to reelect inactive politicians\") combines with the following statement to 'PROVE' / SUPPORT' the example in the last sentence.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese don't look at all like the options on GMAT boldfaced-statement problems.  They're full of specs, whereas the GMAT options are invariably phrased in terms of more generalized abstractions.\nIn cases such as this—where there are marked differences between the two tests—it's  that you try your best to 'adapt' at least the correct answer, and ideally the wrong ones too, to GMAT conventions.\n\nThe correct answer says\n of the necessary changes, and that you come away from the exercise with a better and more precise understanding of the various conventions followed by GMAT problems.",

Natural cleaning products are safe and effective, however, so people should consider switching to healthier and more environmentally friendly cleaning alternatives.\n\nMarcel: But natural cleaning products are not as strong as the mainstream products and often fail to provide the same level of cleanliness. If parents keep the cleaning products out of reach, the products will not create a serious risk for children. And the mainstream cleaning products are cheaper and thus more economical for families to purchase.\n\nMarcel responded to Adelaide’s argument by doing which of the following?\n\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Interesting question, and it looks to me to be a very hard problem, because the distinction between two answer choices is razor thin. Adelaide's argument focuses on the health risks of chemical cleaning products. Marcel does  ignore that concern, and he does not cede the point (he says \"the products will not create a serious risk\"). So A and B are both wrong.\n\nWe have no way to know if Marcel's evidence is apocryphal or unsupported, so no reason to choose C here.\n\nSo the answer is either D or E, and both of those answers seem quite good here. Looking at D, Marcel does raise concerns Adelaide didn't address (the effectiveness and cost of organic cleaning products), and Marcel does offer an alternative take on Adelaide's concern about risk (Marcel talks about how to ensure children aren't exposed to cleaning products). So D is a great answer here.\n\nBut looking at E, it also looks good. Marcel does overlook one important detail of Adelaide's argument -- Marcel never addresses the serious risk to some women that Adelaide brings up. That seems important to me, so I'd be happy saying that Marcel did not \"counter her claims with sufficient objection\". The reason I prefer D to E here is that E says Marcel overlooked \"important \" of Adelaide's argument, and Marcel really only overlooks one detail, so it's not correct to use the plural \"details\". So D seems like the best answer to me, but if D weren't among the choices, I'd feel good about picking answer E too.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

Accounts written by Portuguese contemporaries report the defeat but omit mention of the fact that King Sebastian of Portugal was killed in the battle. Such omissions cannot simply be the result of ignorance of Sebastian's death. Sebastian's death is not even mentioned in the battle accounts written by two captured Portuguese officers while waiting to be ransomed from a Moroccan prison. These two officers actually shared their cells with the Portuguese soldiers who identified the king's body to Moroccan officials.

The omission of the killing of the king has a psychological cause- the Portuguese found Sebastian's death so humiliating that they could not write about it\n\nWhat the question asks:\nWe need to identify the significance of a part of the argument. \n\nStrategy:\nFor this type of question, the best approach is to identify the significance of each sentence from the start. Let's proceed this way-\n - This sentence provides the base of the rest of the argument. It provides information about an event, which is possibly later discussed in the argument\n omit mention of the fact that King Sebastian of Portugal was killed in the battle. - Suggests a possible direction the rest of the argument would go towards - identifying why there are omissions of the king's death \n mentioned in the battle accounts written by two captured Portuguese officers while waiting to be ransomed from a Moroccan prison. - Interesting! The argument now tells about the two soldiers. I wonder why!?\n - An \"evidence\" means a fact or a sign of the truth that makes us believe something. This answer choice indicates that the story about the two prisoners is presented because the author wanted to present us with some sort of evidence. However, there is no evidence, just a premise (the two prisoners were in the same cell) and a conclusion (the omission has had a psychological cause). Hence, this answer choice could be ruled out\n(B)  - Identifying the premises is the key here. The argument's two main premises (1. The Portuguese lost the battle, and 2. Omission of the king's death in history) together offer a contradiction. However, this answer choice indicates that the two premises contradict each other. \n(C)  - This answer choice suggests that the story about the two prisoners gives evidence that supports a general psychological principle. Is it so, though? We are not sure. Maybe the argument is made by a history enthusiast/expert or a psychology enthusiast/expert or none of the two. If it is made by a psychology expert, one could suspect that the conclusion is based on some background theory and experiments that are not mentioned in the argument. However, we are not told that the argument is made by a psychological expert. Hence, this answer choice falls short\n(D)  - This sounds in line with what we discussed in our strategy. The author feels so strongly about the cause that he has mentioned in the argument that he considers it to be the only possible explanation ( - This is an easy no-go.

Thus, unless CompTech Corporation increases the salaries of its software engineers to the same level as those of MicroFirm, these CompTech employees are likely to leave CompTech for another employer.\n\nThe flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to the reasoning in which of the following arguments?\n\n",

        "explanation": "This is quite challenging, but the answer appears to be D.\n\n\n\nWe could paraphrase the passage as follows:\n\n\n\nMicrofirm's high salaries -&gt; employees don't seek work elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, without high salaries, employees will seek work elsewhere.\n\n\n\nThis is the fallacy of denying the antecedent.

        "question": "Jaime: The life span for both African and Asian elephants is much shorter in zoos than in the national reserve parks. Studies have proven this by comparing the life spans of elephants in zoos to the life spans of elephants in nature reserves in both Kenya and Myanmar. Thus, our government should take a serious look at how zoos treat their elephants and possibly implement a temporary ban on the acquisition of new elephants until this issue is resolved.\n\nEleanor: But both the reserves you mention are protected areas where the animals do not face the threat of poaching and other unnatural dangers. Also, the data in those studies go back more than 40 years and do not take into account more recent advances in captive animal care that will most definitely extend the life spans of elephants currently in zoos. \n\nEleanor’s rejection of Jaime’s conclusion employs which one of the following techniques of argumentation?\n\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Answer: D\n\n\nThis is a Describe question. It asks you to find the answer that accurately describes the argumentation technique that Eleanor uses to make her case.\n\n\nThe subject of this conversation between Jaime and Eleanor is the life span of elephants in captivity. Jaime’s conclusion is based on studies that show that elephants living in two protected reserve parks in Kenya and Myanmar live longer than those that live in zoos. Eleanor’s argument is (1) that zoos are painted in a bad light because the elephants in parks don’t face the same dangers as elephants in the wild and (2) that the studies that Jaime cites on zoos are outdated.\n\n\nEleanor discards the premises that Jaime uses to reach his conclusion—namely, the link between living in a reserve park and a longer life, as well as the studies he cites, which she says are obsolete. \n\n\nRegarding answer A, Eleanor does not offer such an example, so it cannot be your answer. For answer B, Eleanor does not question the conclusion, only how Jaime reached it. Also, she does not question the verity of his data, only his choice of data population. Answer C says that Eleanor is trying to bolster Jaime’s argument, which is definitely not the case. Answer D states that Eleanor rejects the correlation between the zoos and nature reserves that Jaime chose to make his argument and that changing his data pool will affect Jaime’s supporting statements that led to his conclusion. These both seem to be exactly what Eleanor is doing with her argument. Answer E is partially correct in that she is questioning his assumptions, but she is not pursuing a wider data sampling but a different data sample altogether.

So it may happen that an elderly person uses healthcare 10 times and pays $100 but a young person will pay $200 for using just once. So this option points out two flaws, one of which is not actually a flaw.\n\n\nB. If the healthcare cost comes down, then per capita cost might come down even if the elderly population increases. So the argument will stay valid only if it is assumed that healthcare costs are stable or are increasing. This options points out one of the two assumptions only.\n\n\nC. Irrelevant\n\nD.

I’ve summarized the reasoning above.\n\nThis is a good argument. We all know that a camera can replicate a scene more accurately and more quickly than a painter can.\n\nYet people still paint, and people still enjoy new paintings. So there must be some other things that people like about paintings.\n\nA couple of the answers mention that the argument is a defense of people’s taste. It isn’t. The argument may perhaps defend abstract impressionism, but the argument isn’t defending the fact that people like more than realism in paintings. That’s just a fact that the argument wants to prove.\n\n___________\n\nA. The stimulus doesn’t mention “what most people appreciate”. This couldn’t possibly be the right answer. Also, the conclusion is not about an abstract principle. The conclusion is about what people appreciate in paintings.\n\nB. What aesthetic principle? The stimulus doesn’t mention any. And the argument isn’t defending people’s tastes. It’s merely describing them.\n\nC. The stimulus is talking about the present, not about history. The stimulus uses a historical fact, but only to make a claim about what’s true in the present.\n\nThe historical fact is that photography hasn’t displaced painting.

So, we can handle it as an Assumption question and look for a choice such that, if it's not true, the plan won't succeed.\n\n\n\nThis choice does not have to be true for the plan to succeed since they didn't say that they would rely on the workers who sew to install the machines.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice does not have to be true for the plan to succeed.\n\nThe accountant mentions installing new sewing machines \"this week.\"\n\nThen, as discussed above, the executive says that, by contracting for sweatshirts instead of dress shirts, they can start to make shirts \"two weeks later.\"\n\n\"Two weeks later\" than \"this week\" is not \"next week.\" Rather, two weeks later than this week is the week after next week.\n\nSo, the executive's plan does not involve installing the new machines \"by the end of next week.\" It involves installing them by the week after next week.\n\nThus, the plan can work even if it's NOT true that the new machines can be installed by the end of next week without overtime work. \n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is tricky because we could get the impression that, since they don't mention overtime in discussing the contracts, they're not concerned with overtime involved in completing the contracts.\n\nAt the same time, none of the other choices work. So, this is the only possible answer.\n\nSo, we can go back to the passage to confirm that they don't say anything about the jacket contract that indicates that this choice doesn't have to be true for the plan to succeed.\n\nDoing so, we that the accountant says the following about the jacket contract:\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the executive says nothing about the jacket contract.\n\nThus, when the executive says, \"that way we can avoid any overtime work,\" the executive must be assuming that the contracts, including the jacket contract, can be completed without any overtime work. After all, if this choice is not true, then even if the machines are installed without overtime work, they'll still end up with overtime work.\n\nSo, we can see that, for the plan to succeed, it must be true that the jacket contract can be completed on time without any overtime work.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThis choice doesn't have to be true for the plan to succeed since the way the plan succeeds is by pushing back when they need to start working on shirts, not by having the workers sew faster.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThe executive states as fact that the sweatshirt contract can be started two weeks later. In doing so, the executive must be taking into account how long it takes to make a sweatshirt. So, there's no reason to believe that it must be true that a sweatshirt does not take longer to sew because, even if it does, the sweatshirt contract can be started later, apparently.\n\nEliminate.\n\n C­",

So let's say that it's share of the pie stays the same, but the overall pie gets bigger.\n\nSo, \"Low\" might have 15% market share. And in 1995, it STILL has 15%...though the overall pie got bigger.\n\n\"High\" WILL increase its share of total employment. It can either have more or less than the 15% market share that \"Low\" has.\n\n1) If &lt;15%, let's say 5%. If 5% and \"High\" increased to 8%, that gain CAN be less than the gain that LOW experiences. While LOW's % market share stays the same, there is an increase in the overall pie and so LOW will increase. HIGH staying at 5% will also increase but it will increase a very small amount. Its share % can increase to 8%, and the total quantity increased can still be smaller than LOW's increase. See example below.\n\n2) If &gt;15%, let's say 25%. If 25% and \"High\" increased to 35%, that gain is going to be BIGGER than LOW's gain....conflicts with information in the passage\n\n\nWith Numbers:\n\nAssume Total Employment: 100 ---&gt; 200\n1982: LOW 15, HIGH 5.\n          LOW (15/100 = 15%); HIGH (5/100 = 5%)\n\n1995: LOW 30, HIGH 16\n           LOW (30/200 = 15%); HIGH (16/200 = 8%)\n\nHere, LOW's % stayed the same, but HIGH's % increased.

Let me make clear --- this judging I am doing is from the perspective of someone who writes CR questions.  This criterion --- too explicit to be an inference ---- is something a question writer need to keep in mind, but if the question writer has done the job well, this is never a consideration that the test taker needs to address.   \n\nSecondly, notice that  is really aligned with the thrust of the argument.   Overall, the argument is about  ---- look how much money we can save, offering distance learning instead of on-site learning.   Choice  is very much about the central point the argument is making --- that's also a characteristic of a good CR inference.   By contrast,  is a detail, a throwaway mention, not vital to the argument overall.  Once again, this is also a criterion that should be employed in question creation, but if a question is well-written, this shouldn't really be a concern for the test taker.  \n\nAs is often the case, the questions that generate a great deal of discussion on these forums are the poorly written questions that ultimately raise a bunch of issues that really are of little use to someone studying for the GMAT.   What most helps folks preparing for the GMAT are quality questions.

        "question": "In the Business program at a university, all candidates for the MBA in International Business who entered the program after 1990 took a seminar on Microeconomics, and all candidates for the MBA in International Business who entered the program after 1994 took a seminar on Applied Economics. \n\nIf a student in the Business program described above took a seminar on Microeconomics but did not take a seminar on Applied Economics, which of the following must be true?\n",

        "explanation": "It's C.  I think a lot of you guys are getting the logic backwards.\n\n\nA was my first choice until I got to C and realized that they wanted you to focus specifically on the International Business MBA.\n\nB &amp; E are not correct and here's why...We know for a FACT that this guy has taken the microeconomics seminar.  The problem is, we don't know whether he was required to take it, or whether he just took it for the hell of it.  The microecon seminar only became a required course after 1990.  This guy could have entered the IB program in '89, taken the microecon seminar because he thought it was interesting, and then went on his merry way to getting his degree.  You guys are right that if he entered the program between 91-94 he would HAVE to take the microecon course.  But that's getting the logic backwards.  We already know he took the microecon course.  We just don't know whether it was a requirement or not.\n\nC is the correct answer.  If the guy hasn't taken the Applied Econ seminar, then there is no possible way that he entered the course later than 1994.  If he entered after 1994, he would have been required to take that class.  That's ALL we know in this problem.  Just because he took the microecon course doesn't mean he did it because of a requirement.\n\nD is wrong because, as many of you have pointed out, he could have entered the program between 91 &amp; 94, in which case he would have taken Microecon but not Applied Econ.\n\nIn summary, I think a lot of you are getting the logic wrong for this problem.  You have to start with what you know about the student: he took Micro but not Applied.  Then you realize that there was a requirement for Applied, so the fact that he didn't take it means that he was not required to.  That would get you to the right answer.  Further, you could realize that just because he took micro does not mean he was required to take it.  Basically, a requirement guarantees that you take the class...so lack of class means lack of requirement.  Presence of class does not necessarily mean presence of requirement.\n\nHope that helps (and hope it was right, too).  Good luck w/ the studying, everybody.  Peace.\n\nEDIT:\n\nJust a little diagram:\n\nRequirement ----&gt; Class\nClass ----/-----&gt; Requirement\nBUT\nNo Class -------&gt; No requirement\n\nIs that the contrapositive?  I forget those terms...maybe somebody who remembers can enlighten us?",

Let's break down the passage first.\n\nThe passage states that \"the sanitation department will not stay within its budget unless the sorting requirement for residents is implemented.\" This means that having residents sort their recyclables is REQUIRED in order for the sanitation department to stay within its budget.\n\nIn addition, we know that if residents sort their own recyclables, many will put these items in the regular garbage, which \"will result in more recyclables being buried in the city's landfill.\"\n\nTo answer the question, we must find an answer choice that \"logically follows from the information above.\"\n\nNow, let's take a look at answer choice (D):\nWe know from the passage that having residents sort their recyclables is REQUIRED in order for the sanitation department to stay within its budget. So, if the sanitation department stays within its budget (as stated in this answer choice), then the sorting requirement for residents MUST be implemented. Further, we know that if the sorting requirement is implemented, then more recyclables will end up in the city's landfill.\n\nSo, it follows logically that if the sanitation department stays within its budget, the amount of recyclables going to the city's landfill will increase. (D) is the correct answer.\n\nLet's address your specific questions:\n\nWe cannot take this for granted! Note that having residents sort recyclables instead of city workers doing so is a  for the sanitation department to stay within its budget. So, the department will definitely NOT stay within budget unless the residents sort their recyclables -- which is very different than saying that the department definitely WILL stay within budget if this plan is implemented.  \n\nYes, there could be many other factors that lead to the sanitation department exceeding its budget. But again, the key is to realize that residents MUST sort their recycling in order for the sanitation department to have any chance to stay within its budget. \n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

How fast does mail in category Q arrive?  We can draw absolutely no conclusion about this.   We also have no idea what proportion arrives earlier and what proportion arrives late.  \n\nGiven the last piece of information --- \"\" --- from this, we absolutely know that P1 does not account for a majority of mail.

This is precisely what  says.   This is by far the best answer, the only possible right answer.  \n\nWhy is  wrong?  This directly contradicts the statement that  correct addressed mail arrives within two days and therefore is not damaged.  \n\nWhy is  wrong?  Well, this one  be true, but it is not necessarily true --- it doesn't reach the standard of \":\nP1 = 39%\nP2 = 1%\nQ = 60%, and all of it arrives late\nThis scenario is consistent with all the statements in the argument, and this supports answer \n\n:\nP1 = 19%\nP2 = 1%\nQ = 80%, and this consists of two sub-categories\nQ1 = 25% --- arrive in two days days\nQ2 = 55% --- arrives in three or more days\nNow, all the statements in the argument are still true --- it's still true that the majority of mail --- 56% (P2 + Q2) arrives late --- but now if we look at the 44% that arrives on time, 25/44 comes from Q, the incorrectly addressed mail, and 19/44 comes P, the correctly addressed mail.  Thus, the majority of mail that arrives on time, 25/44, comes from category Q, the incorrectly addressed mail.   This is a scenario totally consistent with the argument in which  is false.   \n\nThus, we can construct scenarios consistent with the argument that make  either true or false, so it is not a candidate for a \"\" answer.   \n\nThe only viable answer is , the OA.  \n\nPlease let me know if anyone reading this has any further questions.  \n\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)",

There are proportionately more people with college degrees among managers and other professionals than among service and clerical workers. Surprisingly, however, 2009 figures indicate that people employed as managers and other professionals were no more likely than people employed as service and clerical workers to have searched for a new job.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent paradox?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "We have three facts.\n\n- People with a college degree are more likely than others to search for a new job while they are employed.\n\n- There are proportionately more people with college degrees among managers and other professionals than among service and clerical workers. \n\n- 2009 figures indicate that people employed as managers and other professionals were no more likely than people employed as service and clerical workers to have searched for a new job.\n\nHow do we reconcile these facts? We need something that explains why the outcome is different from what would be expected.\n\n\n\nDoes (E) provide such a factor?\n\n\nDoes this choice provide an additional factor that would affect whether people search for new jobs while employed? What factor would that be? All this choice tells us is that managerial and professional jobs are more likely to be filled by people with college degrees than service and clerical jobs are. It doesn't give us any reason to believe that people in managerial and professional jobs won't search for new jobs or that people in service or clerical jobs will search for new jobs.\n\nThe truth is that choice (E) doesn't really tell us much that we don't already know. We already know that managerial and professional jobs are more likely to be held by people with college degrees than other jobs are, and (E) confirms that.\n\nIn fact, if anything, (E) deepens the paradox, because it tends to indicate that people without college degrees in managerial and professional jobs are being replaced by people with college degrees, conceivably increasing the percentage of such jobs held by people with college degrees, who, according to the passage, are more likely than people without degrees to search for new jobs while employed.\n\nSo, (E) is not our correct answer.\n\nThere's only one choice that provides the factor we need, choice (C).\n\n\nThat choice certainly provides another factor affecting why people search for new jobs while employed: feeling overqualfied.\n\nNow, do we know for sure that people in service and clerical jobs are more likely to feel overqualified than people in managerial and professional jobs? No. So, this choice is not ideal, because we don't have the means to clearly connect this choice either to service and clerical jobs or to managerial and professional jobs. In fact, it could be that people in managerial and professional jobs are more likely to feel overqualified for their jobs than are people in service and clerical jobs.\n\nAll the same, this choice is the ONLY ONE that provides any kind of factor that would affect whether people would search for new jobs while employed. So, we are stuck with this choice.\n\nFurther, we could make the case that a person is more likely to feel overqualified in a service or clerical job than in a managerial or professional job. Do we know that to be the case for sure? No, but that idea is reasonable and, thus, provides an additional reason to choose (C), because, if people in service and clerical jobs are more likely to feel overqualified for their positions than are people in managerial and professional jobs, then people in service jobs' feeling overqualified would explain why they searched for new jobs while employed just as often as people in managerial and professional jobs did, even though people in service jobs are less likely to have college degrees than people in managerial and professional jobs.\n\nSo, since choice (C) is the only one that provides what we need, and because it is at least plausible that people in service or clerical jobs are more likely to feel overqualified for their positions than are people in managerial or professional jobs, (C) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "question": "Epidemiologist: In Brazil, schistosomiasis and malaria are the two most common infectious diseases. Over the past five years, schistosomiasis has been primarily responsible for the overall increase in infectious disease cases. Therefore it is likely that there were more cases of schistosomiasis than malaria five years ago.\n\nWhich of the following most strengthens the argument above?\n  \n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "Yes, the argument is analytical. Let's understand it first.\n\nTwo most common infectious diseases: schistosomiasis and malaria\nInfectious disease cases have increased in the past 5 yrs (say from a total of 100 five yrs ago to 150 now). Schistosomiasis led to this increase so probably many of the extra 50 cases are those of Schistosomiasis.\nConclusion: It is likely that there were more cases of schistosomiasis than malaria five years ago i.e. say 5 yrs ago, there were 70 schistosomiasis cases while there were 20 malaria cases (and 10 other disease cases)\n\nWe need to strengthen the conclusion.\n\nA. Over the past five years, the percentage of infectious disease cases caused by schistosomiasis has remained unchanged, but the percentage of cases caused by malaria has increased substantially.\nIf most of the increase in cases is due to schistosomiasis but the % of schistosomiasis in the total cases is the same, it means, most of the cases comprised of schistosomiasis earlier too. So this strengthens our conclusion. Let's take a look using numbers too.\n\nToday if still 70% infectious disease cases are those of schistosomiasis, it means there are 105 schistosomiasis cases today (an increase of 35 out of the extra 50). \nIf malaria cases have increased to 30%, number of malaria cases would be 45 i.e. an increase of 15 out of the extra 50. \nWe see that schistosomiasis cases account for most of the extra 50 cases i.e. they account for 35 cases. So this strengthens our conclusion.\n   \nB. Trends in infectious disease data tend to persist for decades, unless there is a major breakthrough in treatment regimens.\nWe don't know if there has been a major breakthrough in treatment regimens on any disease in the past 5 yrs. It is possible that 5 yrs ago there were more cases of malaria than schistosomiasis but breakthrough in treatment regimen of malaria led to a decline in its cases. \n   \nC. Five years ago, many more people died from schistosomiasis than died from malaria. \nNumber of deaths is irrelevant to the number of cases since the argument doesn't say which disease is more serious, has better medicines etc. It is possible that schistosomiasis had fewer cases 5 yrs ago but is much more serious and led to death more often. \n   \nD. Over the past five years, the percentage of infectious disease cases caused by malaria was not significantly greater than the percentage of cases caused by schistosomiasis.\nThis says that % of malaria cases was not much greater (though perhaps a little greater) than % of schistosomiasis cases over the past 5 years. If anything, this weakens our conclusion. It indirectly implies that out of 100 cases 5 yrs ago, malaria cases were slightly more than schistosomiasis cases. \n   \nE. Over the past five years, the percentage of infectious disease cases caused by diseases other than malaria and schistosomiasis did not increase substantially.\nThis says that % of other diseases has held steady. So if earlier, 10% of cases (10 cases) were other diseases, still 10% of cases (i.e. 15 cases) are other diseases. This doesn't say whether 5 yrs ago there were more cases of schistosomiasis or malaria. \n\nAnswer (A)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

In fact, correctly addressed mail takes longer than this only when it is damaged in transit. Overall, however, most mail arrives three business days or more after being sent. \n\nIf the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?\n\n",
        "answer": "Edited the question.",
        "explanation": "Apparently this is a practice LSAT Analytical Reasoning question, and it's an excellent question.  I'm not sure whether MLSAT is the source, but it is discussed on this page:\n\" of Category P, and this arrives \"\"\nCategory P2 = correctly addressed by damaged in transit --- this is some very small fraction of Category P (whatever the opposite of \"\" is!), and it doesn't arrive quickly  \n\nWe absolutely know that mail in Category P1 arrives within two days.  How fast does mail in category Q arrive?  We can draw absolutely no conclusion about this.   We also have no idea what proportion arrives earlier and what proportion arrives late.  \n\nGiven the last piece of information --- \"\" --- from this, we absolutely know that P1 does not account for a majority of mail.  If P1 is less than half of mail, we know P2 is going to account for such a small percentage that it doesn't matter, and this means Q must account for the majority of mail.  This is precisely what  says.   This is by far the best answer, the only possible right answer.  \n\nWhy is  wrong?  This directly contradicts the statement that  correct addressed mail arrives within two days and therefore is not damaged.  \n\nWhy is  wrong?  Well, this one  be true, but it is not necessarily true --- it doesn't reach the standard of \":\nP1 = 39%\nP2 = 1%\nQ = 60%, and all of it arrives late\nThis scenario is consistent with all the statements in the argument, and this supports answer \n\n:\nP1 = 19%\nP2 = 1%\nQ = 80%, and this consists of two sub-categories\nQ1 = 25% --- arrive in two days days\nQ2 = 55% --- arrives in three or more days\nNow, all the statements in the argument are still true --- it's still true that the majority of mail --- 56% (P2 + Q2) arrives late --- but now if we look at the 44% that arrives on time, 25/44 comes from Q, the incorrectly addressed mail, and 19/44 comes P, the correctly addressed mail.  Thus, the majority of mail that arrives on time, 25/44, comes from category Q, the incorrectly addressed mail.   This is a scenario totally consistent with the argument in which  is false.   \n\nThus, we can construct scenarios consistent with the argument that make  either true or false, so it is not a candidate for a \"\" answer.   \n\nThe only viable answer is , the OA.  \n\nPlease let me know if anyone reading this has any further questions.  \n\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)",

        "question": "Whenever a major political scandal erupts before an election and voters blame the scandal on all parties about equally, virtually all incumbents, from whatever party, seeking reelection are returned to office. However, when voters blame such a scandal on only one party, incumbents from that party are likely to be defeated by challengers from other parties. The proportion of incumbents who seek reelection is high and remarkably constant from election to election.\n\nIf the voters’ reactions are guided by a principle, which one of the following principles would best account for the contrast in reactions described above?\n",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Let's say that the mayor of a town always belongs to one of three political parties: X, Y, or Z. The town holds an election every year, voting either to keep the incumbent mayor (if that mayor runs for reelection) or to elect a new mayor.\n(Scenario 1): According to this statement, if a major political scandal erupts before one of the annual elections and voters blame the scandal on all three parties about equally, then the incumbent mayor, if seeking reelection, will almost certainly win the election, regardless of the mayor's political party affiliation. In other words, even though the incumbent belongs to a party that is equally blamed for the scandal, the incumbent and his/her party do not suffer negative political consequences.\n(Scenario 2): If the current mayor belongs to Party X, and voters blame the scandal on Party X, the current mayor, if seeking reelection, is likely to be defeated by a challenger from Party Y or Party Z. In other words, when the incumbent's party is the ONLY party blamed, the incumbent and his/her party DO suffer negative political consequences.\n\nNow on to the question stem:\nThe \"voters' reactions\" are described in the first two sentences: scenario 1) when voters blame a pre-election scandal on all parties equally, the incumbent usually wins, and scenario 2) when voters blame a pre-election scandal on the party of the incumbent, the incumbent usually loses. If we are told that those reactions are guided by a principle, which principle would best account for the contrast in those reactions?\nThe argument in the passage does not discuss how the voters would react if one incumbent were responsible for one major scandal and another incumbent were responsible for another. Choice (A) can be eliminated.\nWe are looking for a principle that accounts for the contrast in the voters' reactions (scenario 1 vs scenario 2), and we don't care whether the judgment on which one reaction is based is more accurate than the judgment on which the other is based. Choice (B) can be eliminated.\nFirst, the passage does not consider whether incumbents blamed for a major political scandal should or should not seek reelection. Second, choice (C) only explains the voters' reaction in scenario 2 and does NOT explain the  in those reactions. Choice (C) can be eliminated.\nThis statement does not align with the information in the passage. According to the passage, if incumbents (and hence their parties) are blamed for a pre-election scandal, those incumbents will most likely lose the election, regardless of \"who their challengers are.\" Choice (D) can be eliminated.\nFirst, apply this principle to scenario 2 (the incumbent's party--Party X, for example--receives all of the blame): in that case, Party X can easily be penalized by voting for someone in Party Y or Party Z. Now, consider scenario 1 (for example, the incumbent belongs to Party X but Parties X, Y, and Z all receive equal blame): if we follow the principle in statement (E), we should penalize ALL parties. If we vote for someone in Party Y or Z, one of those parties is rewarded while party X is penalized. There is no way to penalize all parties equally since a member of one of the parties has to win. In that case, the voters might just stick with the default option (the incumbent). Thus, choice (E) is the best choice.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

        "question": "Smoking in bed has long been the main cause of home fires. Despite a significant decline in cigarette smoking in the last two decades, however, there has been no comparable decline in the number of people killed in home fires.\n\nEach one of the following statements, if true, over the last two decades, helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy above EXCEPT:\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "(B)\n\nOne last question, and in it we’re faced with another apparent discrepancy. This time, however, we’re looking for the one choice that doesn’t help explain the unusual result or finding. First, we get some background info: smoking in bed has long been a major cause of home fires. And here’s the surprise: even though cigarette smoking has significantly declined over the last twenty years, the number of people killed in home fires hasn’t declined accordingly. There are at least four good reasons why this is so, and we’ll see those below in the wrong answer choices. But we’re looking for the one that doesn’t help solve the mystery. And (B) could only deepen the mystery: if the fires caused by smoking in bed tend to take place after the home’s occupants have fallen asleep, then home fires caused by smoking would seem even deadlier, since it’s hard to evacuate your home when you’re asleep. If fires caused by smoking are especially deadly, then it is all the more confusing that a reduction in smoking has not led to a reduction of the number of people killed in home fires. So (B) is no help, which means that it is the credited response.\n\n(A) If (A) is true, then bed-smoking fires aren’t likely to cause many fire-related deaths in the first place. Under these circumstances, a decline in smoking wouldn’t be expected to result in a corresponding decline in home-fire deaths.\n\n(C) picks up on the scope shift between the first and second sentences: There’s been a significant decline in cigarette smoking in general, but that doesn’t mean the decline includes the subset of people who smoke in bed. If (C) is true, we’d expect most of the bedsmokers to keep on smoking, which would certainly help resolve the apparent discrepancy.\n\n(D) and (E) both help to resolve the paradox by offering other reasons why deaths from fires have increased lately. If kitchen fires or greater population densities are responsible for more home-fire deaths than before, the fact that no decline in fire deaths has accompanied the decline in cigarette smoking is far less surprising.\n\n• Once again, the wrong choices offer a plethora of alternative explanations (see section A, Q. 20 for another situation loaded with alternative explanations). After all, what better way to resolve a paradox than to find a different, unmentioned, and plausible explanation for the surprising result? Understanding the concept of the alternative explanation can help you to answer Logical Flaw, Assumption, Paradox, and even Strengthen/Weaken questions. Make sure you keep this important concept in the forefront of your mind whenever working on LSAT Logical Reasoning.\n\n• Keep your eyes peeled for scope shifts; sometimes they’re fairly subtle. Bed-smoking is not the same as cigarette smoking in general. “Home fires” from the first sentence is not the same as “people killed from home fires” in the second. Understanding these subtle distinctions when they exist in an argument will help you to assess that argument correctly and to answer any question the testmakers choose to throw at you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

There are proportionately more people with college degrees among managers and other professionals than among service and clerical workers. Surprisingly, however, 2009 figures indicate that people employed as managers and other professionals were no more likely than people employed as service and clerical workers to have searched for a new job.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent paradox?\n",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "We have three facts.\n\n- People with a college degree are more likely than others to search for a new job while they are employed.\n\n- There are proportionately more people with college degrees among managers and other professionals than among service and clerical workers. \n\n- 2009 figures indicate that people employed as managers and other professionals were no more likely than people employed as service and clerical workers to have searched for a new job.\n\nHow do we reconcile these facts? We need something that explains why the outcome is different from what would be expected.\n\n\n\nDoes (E) provide such a factor?\n\n\nDoes this choice provide an additional factor that would affect whether people search for new jobs while employed? What factor would that be? All this choice tells us is that managerial and professional jobs are more likely to be filled by people with college degrees than service and clerical jobs are. It doesn't give us any reason to believe that people in managerial and professional jobs won't search for new jobs or that people in service or clerical jobs will search for new jobs.\n\nThe truth is that choice (E) doesn't really tell us much that we don't already know. We already know that managerial and professional jobs are more likely to be held by people with college degrees than other jobs are, and (E) confirms that.\n\nIn fact, if anything, (E) deepens the paradox, because it tends to indicate that people without college degrees in managerial and professional jobs are being replaced by people with college degrees, conceivably increasing the percentage of such jobs held by people with college degrees, who, according to the passage, are more likely than people without degrees to search for new jobs while employed.\n\nSo, (E) is not our correct answer.\n\nThere's only one choice that provides the factor we need, choice (C).\n\n\nThat choice certainly provides another factor affecting why people search for new jobs while employed: feeling overqualfied.\n\nNow, do we know for sure that people in service and clerical jobs are more likely to feel overqualified than people in managerial and professional jobs? No. So, this choice is not ideal, because we don't have the means to clearly connect this choice either to service and clerical jobs or to managerial and professional jobs. In fact, it could be that people in managerial and professional jobs are more likely to feel overqualified for their jobs than are people in service and clerical jobs.\n\nAll the same, this choice is the ONLY ONE that provides any kind of factor that would affect whether people would search for new jobs while employed. So, we are stuck with this choice.\n\nFurther, we could make the case that a person is more likely to feel overqualified in a service or clerical job than in a managerial or professional job. Do we know that to be the case for sure? No, but that idea is reasonable and, thus, provides an additional reason to choose (C), because, if people in service and clerical jobs are more likely to feel overqualified for their positions than are people in managerial and professional jobs, then people in service jobs' feeling overqualified would explain why they searched for new jobs while employed just as often as people in managerial and professional jobs did, even though people in service jobs are less likely to have college degrees than people in managerial and professional jobs.\n\nSo, since choice (C) is the only one that provides what we need, and because it is at least plausible that people in service or clerical jobs are more likely to feel overqualified for their positions than are people in managerial or professional jobs, (C) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

However, despite the increases in government grants and tax incentives, the number of new drugs and devices approved by the government regulatory agency has actually dropped by 30 percent over ten years—even though the approval process has not changed nor the diligence with which it is carried out.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, would most help to explain why the 30 percent drop has occurred?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The passage presents a surprising situation in which, even though the government has \"over the last twenty years\" taken actions to increase the number of new drugs and medical devices produced by the country's companies and the approval process has not changed, the number of new drugs and devices approved by the government regulatory agency has \"dropped by 30 percent over ten years.\"\n\n\n\nThis question is a Paradox or Best Explains question, and the correct answer will explain why there was a 30 percent decrease over ten years despite a twenty-year effort to achieve an increase.\n\n\n\nSeeing this choice, we get the sense that answering this question is going to involve noticing specific details.\n\nWhat we can notice about the specific details of this choice is that a 25 percent decrease in funding for staffing over fifteen years doesn't quite match up with a 30 percent decrease in approvals over ten years.\n\nYes, what this choice says would explain a decrease in approvals. In fact, it would explain well a 25 percent decrease over 15 years. After all, the fact that funding for staffing of the agency decreased would explain why approvals by the agency slowed down.\n\nAt the same time, this choice's specific information about a 25 percent decrease over fifteen years doesn't seen to explain a larger, 30 percent decrease over a shorter time period, ten years.\n\nSo, this choice is likely incorrect, but we can keep it until we find a better one.\n\nKeep for now, but expect to be incorrect.\n\n\n\nPresumably this fact has been true all along. So, it would not explain why a decrease started 10 years ago.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice presents a comparison of spending on drugs with spending on medical devices but doesn't say that overall spending on the two categories of products decreased. In fact, for all we know given what this choice says, overall spending could have increased if spending on medical devices increased substantially.\n\nSo, this comparison does not explain the decrease in approvals.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is like choice (A) and once again is likely incorrect because of specifics,\n\nAfter all, a 10 percent decrease in graduates from pharmacy schools over 15 years doesn't quite match up with a 30 percent decrease in approvals over 10 years.\n\nWhat this choice says would perhaps explain a 10 percent decrease over 15 years but doesn't seen to explain a larger, 30 percent, decrease over a shorter time period, 10 years.\n\nSo, this choice is likely incorrect.\n\nKeep for now, but expect to be incorrect.\n\n\n\nThis choice doesn't explain a decreae in approvals over the past 10 years at all.\n\nDoes depending on foreign patents cause a decrease in approvals? We have no reason to believe it does.\n\nAlso, something that occurred over the last twenty years would not likely have caused a decrease over only the past ten years.\n\nEliminate.\n\nHaving gone through all the choices, we're left with (A) and (D) as the only ones that could at all explain a decrease.\n\n(A), with its 25 percent decrease in staffing over 15 years, is closer to a 30 percent decrease over 10 years than (D), with it's 10 percent decrease in graduates.\n\nSo, its a good thing we kept (A) since (A) is the best choice.\n\n A",

        "question": "Construction contractors working on the cutting edge of technology nearly always work on a \"cost-plus\" basis only. One kind of cost-plus contract stipulates the contractor's profit as a fixed percentage of the contractor's costs; the other kind stipulates a fixed amount of profit over and above costs.Under the first kind of contract, higher costs yield higher profits for the contractor, so this is where one might expect final costs in excess of original cost estimates to be more common. Paradoxically, such cost overruns are actually more common if the contract is of the fixed-profit kind. \n\nWhich one of the following , if true, most helps to resolve the apparent paradox in the situation described above? \n\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Premise 1: Contract one - profit as a fixed percentage of the costs.  Higher costs = higher profits - thus, you might expect that final costs exceeding original cost estimates to be more common.\nPremise 2: A second stipulates a fixed amount of profit, meaning, no matter the cost, your profits will remain the same.\nConclusion: Cost overruns are actually more common if the contract is of the fixed-profit kind.\n\nWhich one of the following , if true, most helps to resolve the apparent paradox in the situation described above? \n\nA) Clients are much less likely to agree to a fixed-profit type of cost plus contract when it is understood that under certain conditions the project will be scuttled than they are when there is no such understanding. \nThis does not explain the discrepancy.\n\nB) On long-term contracts, cost projections take future inflation into account, but since the figures used are provided by the government,they are usually underestimates. \nThis does not explain the discrepancy.\n\nC) On any sizable construction project, the contractor bills the client monthly or quarterly, so any tendency for original cost estimates to be exceeded can be detected early. \nThis does not explain the discrepancy.\n\nD) Clients billed under a cost-plus contract are free to review individual billings in order to uncover wasteful expenditures, but they do so only when the contractor's profit varies with cost.\nCorrect!\nThe ability for clients to review individual billings is to help monitor spending -- especially since contractors can take advantage of some types of contracts to gain more profit from wasteful expenditures, this would be useful.  However, note that this says they can review ONLY when profits vary with the costs.  OK, so which of the two contracts would result in most variances, and thus, would allow clients to review spending more often?  Well, that's the percentage contract; thus, contractors have a good reason not to spend unnecessarily in order to get more profit.\n\nLet's say you get 25% of all costs... first cost is $100 --  your profit is $25.  Next, you want more profit, so you will end up spending $500 instead -- your profit is now $125!  Pretty good, but your profits are now varying with the cost... clients will be able check up on you.  You probably won't want to increase costs just for profit anymore, or you might get caught...  Cost overruns could perhaps be very common with the fixed contract, however: let's say, for example, your fixed profit is $500 above costs.  Your cost is $500, with $400 in overrun costs -- you make $500.  The cost is $ 1500, with $1200 in overrun costs -- you make $500.  Your client cannot review your spending in any of these cases because your profit hasn't been fluctuating with the costs -- in other words, even though the costs increase, your profits do not increase, despite having $1600 in wasteful expenditures.  This is why cost overruns are more common for this type of contract than the percentage one.\n\nE) The practice of submitting deliberately exaggerated cost estimates is most common in the case of fixed-profit contracts because it makes the profit, as a percentage of estimated cost, appear modest. \nThis one is perhaps the most temping out of the wrong answers (seems to be talking about \"fixed-profit\" and \"percentage\" in a explanatory sort of manner).  However, this doesn't really explain why overrun costs may be more common in fixed-profit contracts as opposed to percentage contracts... at most, this might explain why cost overruns are common with fixed-profit contracts, but it does not adequately explain why it is  common than percentage-based contracts.\n\nHope this makes sense.",

        "question": "Kiki birds breed more effectively in some temperatures than in others. During the period from 1991 to 1995, the kiki bird population in a certain region increased, despite a moratorium, or official ban, on the hunting of the kiki bird's chief predator. During the period from 1996 to 2000, the kiki bird population in the same region declined, despite ideal breeding temperatures during that period.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, best explains why the kiki bird population increased during the period from 1991 to 1995, then declined during the period from 1996 to 2000?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "First I read the question: \n\n\nSo this is an 'explain' CR question. These questions present something that is--to the author--unexpected or surprising. It will be up to us to explain how that thing happened. \n\nIn many ways, I think of these as 'weaken' the argument questions. The author WOULD HAVE concluded the opposite of what happened. I need to figure out what the author WOULD HAVE reasoned to make that conclusion, and show why it's wrong. \n\nThen I read the passage: \n\n\nSo there's something strange going on here, and I'm thinking it's a typo. Why would an 'official ban' on 'hunting the bird's chief predator' not lead to the population to increase? The word 'despite' seems illogical in this instance... So I'm assuming it's a typo and that it's supposed to be 'due to.'  \n\n\n\nWith that correction, I do a little critical reasoning. The bird population increased when there was this moratorium on hunting the bird's predators. Then, despite having an ideal temperature for the birds, the population of birds declined. \n\nWell, my immediate thought is 'did the moratorium end?' If the population surged during a moratorium, might it then decline if the moratorium ended and people started killing the predators again? That seems very likely.\n\nOther than that, I'm thinking about some general thing that could lower the birds' population even with a good temperature for them. \n\nI go to answers with this 'goal' in mind.\n\n\n\nThis helps add explanation to why their population surged at first, not why it then dropped. Eliminate. \n\n\nThis only makes the surprise more extreme. If the moratorium on hunting the predator was not enforced *during* the surge, but was enforced *during the decline?* That would mean the predators were killed more as the bird population dropped. That doesn't explain why the population dropped, it makes it even weirder that the population dropped.\n\n\nThis has me curious. It's one of those answers that 'surprises' me, because I hadn't even considered breeding temperature for the predator... I think it's wrong, but I don't want to waste time on it at the moment, so I'll keep it and move on. \n\n\nThis doesn't seem relevant. Nowhere is the reasoning dependent on the other prey (or lack of prey) for the predator. \n\n\nWell this seems to be exactly my goal? If the population of the predator surged in the years of the kiki birds' decline, that makes sense, even when the temperature was good for the bird. I choose E. \n\n...And the answer is B. \n\nOkay, so either this question is poorly formed, or my reasoning is wrong. I'm going to first presume my reasoning is wrong and try to figure out why. \n\nThere are three reasons we miss CR questions: (See:  here to understand what that 'moratorium' really meant:\n\nMoratorium on hunting predators -----&gt;No more killing predators (according to rules, anyway) -------&gt;Predator population probably increases -------&gt;More predators to eat birds --------&gt;You'd expect bird population to decline. \n\nI misinterpreted what the moratorium would entail. There are few reasons I think I might have done this:\n\n1). A moratorium on hunting would cause a population to increase! ... Just not the population of the *birds*. Must be specific about categories and cause effect!\n\n2). There's a trickly list of 'negations' going on. A 'BAN' on hunting predators would (reasonably) cause MORE predators, and MORE predators would (reasonably) cause LESS prey. So, we're NOT KILLING the animals that DO KILL the birds. \n\nSomehow this feels like dealing with multiplying a string of negatives and positives together and making sure we're clear which negatives cancel and which don't... I was not careful about this. Again, WRITING DOWN is a good idea. \n\nI also should have realized \n\n(ODDLY ENOUGH: I wrote this very relevant piece very recently:  so check it carefully, don't let arrogance blind you). \n\nSo, now I see why B is correct. If the ban wasn't really enforced in the first time period, the predators were still hunted, and killed, leaving fewer to eat the birds. So the bird population went up. Then the ban was enforced, so the predators weren't hunted as much, so there were more of them around to eat the birds. \n\nNow why is E wrong, because it seems kind of right??? Because it only explains why the population might decline in the back half. It doesn't explain why the bird population went up in the first half (even when the moratorium on hunting the predators existed, making one think the predator population might be going down). \n\nOkay, so, what are the takeaways?\n\n1). When dealing with a causal chain, WRITE DOWN THE CHAIN. Put it in front of you so you can SEE THE THING. \n\n2). Check yourself, check yourself, check yourself. As I wrote in that article (that I apparently ignored outright here), the GMAT is seeing how well/often you analyze your own interpretations and find mistakes. Your brain will convince you it is correct (as mine did here). I failed to notice my mind 'beartrap' on a misinterpretation of cause/effect. \n\nIt's especially important to do this when something seems wrong. When something doesn't seem to make sense, either the problem is poorly written (...virtually no official GMAT question is) or your interpretation is wrong. \n\n3). When dealing with multiple CATEGORIES, try to keep thoughts SPECIFIC TO WHICH CATEGORY. Avoid VAGUENESS. \"The population decline\" is vague. Which population? That of the preys? Or that of the predators? The two blended in my mind here when I wasn't specific about which (takeaway 1 would have really helped avoid this).  \n\n4). When a question asks to explain TWO THINGS, don't explain JUST ONE. That will not be sufficient in the GMAT's eyes. \n\nNow, a lesson for ya'll: Notice how thoroughly I analyzed this. I put my process under the microscope here--as one has to for CR and RC (see again, that video on how to review RC and CR). I didn't have an explanation to read to figure out how I missed it, and I still figured it out. Even if you DO have an explanation, DO NOT USE IT TOO SOON. Do as much thinking yourself as you can. Find specific, concrete takeaways. Notice my takeaways also have a 'when' component to them. \"WHEN there is a causal chain, write it down.\" \"WHEN a question asks to explain two things...\" \"WHEN something doesn't seem to make sense...\" \n\nThese give me specific contexts to notice in the problem or in myself, and the appropriate reaction to them.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\n\nAnswer:",

(A) is out.  \n\nThis answer choice does not resolve the central conflict between the two conclusions. It adds another element (the addictive nature of cigarettes) to support conclusion 1, but it  in light of this further evidence. (B) is out. \n\nThis answer choice does not resolve the apparent conflict for a few reasons. First, we do not know whether \"most advertisements,\" as stated in the answer choice, include cigarette advertisements. It is unclear whether this statement is arguing for cigarette advertisements to be legal, so we do not know if it contradicts conclusion 2. In addition, it does not support the conclusion that  are justified in preventing cigarette advertisements because these ads encourage unhealthy behaviors. Instead, answer choice (C) seems to shift this responsibility to advertisers. (C) is out. \n\nThis one is interesting. The first part of the statement (\"Governments should try to prevent the advertisement of cigarettes\") fits nicely with conclusion 1, that \"governments that try to prevent cigarettes from being advertised are justified in doing so\". \n\nSo far so good, but how does it stack up against conclusion 2 (\"cigarette advertisements should remain \")? Answer choice (D) specifies that governments should use \"financial disincentives \" to prevent the advertisement of cigarettes. \n\nSo, answer choice (D) supports  sides of the apparent conflict. Governments should try to prevent the advertisement of cigarettes, but should do so through financial disincentives rather than legal prohibition. (D) is our answer.\n\nIn stating that \"governments... should not try to prevent [cigarette] advertisements,\" this answer choice directly contradicts conclusion 1 (\"Governments that try to prevent cigarettes from being advertised are justified in doing so\").

        "question": "From 2000 to 2010, beverage containers accounted for a steadily decreasing percentage of the total weight of domestic garbage in Brazil. The increasingly widespread practice of recycling aluminum and plastic was responsible for most of this decline. However, although aluminum recycling was more widely practiced in this period than plastic recycling, the total weight of plastic bottles in Brazil’s domestic garbage declined by a greater percentage during this time than the total weight of aluminum cans in Brazil’s domestic garbage.\n \nWhich of the following, if true in Brazil from 2000 to 2010, most helps to account for the apparent discrepancy?\n",
        "answer": "fixed formatting",
        "explanation": "First, let's identify the \"apparent discrepancy\" in the question. \n\nWe know that from 2000 to 2010, beverage containers accounted for a steadily decreasing percentage of the total weight of domestic garbage in Brazil, thanks primarily to \"the increasingly widespread practice of recycling aluminum and plastic.\" We also know that aluminum recycling was more widely practiced in this period than plastic recycling. So it would seem that the weight of aluminum in domestic garbage would decline faster.\n\nBut here's the discrepancy: the opposite seems to be true. \"...the total weight of plastic bottles in Brazil’s domestic garbage declined by a greater percentage during this time than the total weight of aluminum cans in Brazil’s domestic garbage.\"\n\nSo we need to find something that will help us explain why the total weight of plastic bottles declined by a greater percentage than the weight of aluminum cans -- despite the fact that aluminum recycling was more widespread during this period.\n\nAt first glance, this might seem to be out of scope, since the passage doesn't mention glass at all. But (A) is basically telling us that recycling might not be the only factor reducing the amount of aluminum in Brazil's garbage. If consumers increasingly favored glass beverage containers over plastic ones, that would reduce the number of plastic beverage bottles used by Brazilians and thus reduce the weight of plastic in Brazil's garbage.\n\nIn other words, plastic recycling may not have significantly reduced the weight of plastic in Brazil's garbage, but the change in Brazilians' preferences may have significantly reduced the weight of plastic in Brazil's garbage. This potentially explains why the percent decrease in weight was higher for plastic bottles than for aluminum cans, so let's hang on to choice (A).\n\nAbsolutely everything in the questions deals with percentages, so the relative weight of different containers is irrelevant. Choice (B) does not explain the apparent discrepancy.\n\nThis statement gives us another reason to expect the percent decrease in the weight of aluminum cans to be GREATER than the percent decrease in the weight of plastic bottles. If the opposite information were given (i.e. that a significant fraction of aluminum cans were not beverage containers and most recycled plastic bottles were beverage containers), that  help explain the discrepancy. The statement given in choice (C) only makes the discrepancy more glaring.\n\nThis statement also makes the discrepancy more glaring. If plastic recycling is less widespread AND Brazilians are using more plastic bottles, we would certainly expect the weight of aluminum cans to decrease by a larger percentage. If we were told that the total weight of aluminum cans purchased by Brazilians increased at a significantly faster rate than did the total weight of plastic bottles, that might explain the discrepancy; however, the statement given in choice (D) does not explain the discrepancy.\n\nWe don't care about the number of bottles or cans, only about the total weight as a percentage of the total domestic garbage. Statement (E) does not help.\n\nChoice (A) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

If these institutions have already invested in multi-year licenses for other solutions, it would be financially impractical for them to switch to a new product, regardless of the discounts offered. This choice provides a clear, specific reason that aligns with the institutions' behavior.\n\nThe other options, while plausible, are not as directly aligned with the scenario as (B):\n\nA. The financial institutions are generally conservative in adopting new technology due to the potential risks associated with system transitions and prefer to use software with a proven track record.\n   - While this is a valid concern, it is more general and does not specifically address the scenario of the institutions not adopting the new software despite its benefits.\n\nC. The new software, while advanced, requires a significant amount of training for IT staff, a resource that many financial institutions are currently lacking.\n   - This option introduces the challenge of training but does not directly connect to the reluctance to adopt the software, especially in the context of the offered discounts.\n\nD. Financial institutions prioritize cybersecurity but are hesitant to implement new solutions that have not yet been tested extensively in real-world scenarios.\n   - This choice addresses a general concern about the adoption of new technology but lacks the specificity needed to explain the institutions' behavior in this scenario.\n\nE.

Tricky in part but easy when you get it. Question says O2 18 is rarer in cloud ⛅️ than other isotopes of O2. Lets give them some numbers 10 and 90. When it rains say 5 O2-18 isotopes fall and 3 normal isotope falls down. But the ratio 10 and 90 is maintained through the amazon.

Maybe something is replenishing 5 O2 isotope and 3 other isotopes that fell during the rain. This leads us to B. Lets see other options. \n\n(A) Rain clouds above tropical forests are poorer in oxygen-18 than rain clouds above unforested regions. - does this explains both sides of the argument? No\n\n(B) Like the oceans, tropical rain forests can create or replenish rain clouds in the atmosphere above them. - okay, if clouds can be replenished then ratio would be same and then this will explain why scientists are surprised with their results and which they thought is contrary to their expectations. B Looks great.\n\n(C) The amount of rainfall over the Amazon rain forests is exactly the same as the amount of rain originally collected in the clouds formed above the Atlantic Ocean.- then the isotope ratio should decrease and not stay constant. \n\n(D) The amount of rain recycled back into the atmosphere from the leaves of forest vegetation is exactly the same as the amount of rain in river runoffs that is not recycled into the atmosphere.- uneventfully we can ignore this option.

Surprisingly, all the skeletal remains, which included many species from differing biological families and spanned about two thousand years, showed evidence of experiencing temperatures in excess of 1000 degrees Fahrenheit (or 538 degrees Celsius).\n\nWhich of the following, if true, best explains the apparent paradox between the cold environment and the evidence of the bones experiencing hot temperatures?\n\n",
        "answer": "Renamed the topic and edited the question.",
        "explanation": "The paradox: Northern Canada is quite cold and yet skeletal remains show evidence of experiencing very hot temperatures. This paradox could be explained by finding evidence that fires regularly occurred that would have subjected the bones to excruciatingly hot temperatures. If evidence existed that early humans from this time period hunted animals and started fires (implicitly for the purpose of cooking the animals--thereby creating skeletons of animals that experienced hot temperatures), a large step in explaining the paradox would be taken.\n\nA. Unraveling the paradox depends on providing an explanation of how the skeletal remains experienced such hot temperatures yet this answer only heightens the paradox as it provides evidence that the skeletons' environment was much colder (not warmer) many years ago.\n\nB. Although this provides an explanation of how \"exactly one north Canadian species'\" skeletons showed evidence of exposure to hot temperatures, it fails to account for why \"many species from differing biological families [that] spanned about two thousand years showed\" the same evidence of exposure to hot temperatures.\n\nC. This answer provides an explanation for skeletons showing evidence of experiencing hot temperatures. However, this answer does not explain why this evidence appeared among skeletons whose date \"spanned about two thousand years.\" Further, the fire occurred \"a little over 103,000 years ago\" while the original argument makes clear that some of the skeletons which showed evidence of experiencing hot temperatures dated after this fire (i.e., the skeletons were from 100,000 years ago and \"spanned about two thousand years\" while the fire occurred \"over 103,000 years ago\").\n\nD. The paradox exists in skeletons dating back to 100,000 years ago. Consequently, explaining how a fire (and thus hot temperatures) could have existed \"as early as 70,000 years ago\" does not explain the paradox. In other words, this answer does not explain how the skeletons of animals 100,000 years old experienced hot temperatures (although it would explain how skeletons 70,000 years old experienced hot temperatures).\n\nE. While this answer does not prove what caused the chared skeletal remains, it \"best explains\" how the skeletons experienced hot temperatures (i.e., the hunters cut wood and, implied in this, they started fires to cook animals).",

If Robin cannot solve it, then none of Robin’s friends would be able to solve it. - WRONG. Plain statement as it has a straight flow that is reasonably logical in approach.\n\n(B) We should not pick Hank for the relay team. He has not won a race all season, so there is no reason to expect him to help the relay team win. - WRONG. Again plain as it was choice A. \n\n(C) Laws that contain exemptions for some individuals based on no relevant consideration are fundamentally immoral. If it is wrong for a given person to commit an act, then it is wrong for anyone else in similar circumstances to commit the act. - WRONG. Logically correct. Why it is immoral is reasoned well in the second sentence. \n\n(D) There is no point in asking the club to purchase tents and make them available for use by club members. No member of the club can afford one of those tents, so the club is unable to afford any either. - CORRECT. \n\n(E) Agreeing with all of the other members of society does not guarantee that one is correct about an issue. With many topics it is possible for society to be mistaken and hence every individual in society to be likewise mistaken. - WRONG. This one is a bit smooth to catch. On the one hand, it considers an individual being not correct and on the other hand reasons that logic with that individual being mistaken(not correct) for going along with the society. So, either way it is same by going along with society i.e. whether one is correct(not likely if society is wrong) or one being mistaken when society as a whole is wrong. The problem is with how this  choice is worded.\n\nAn after-thought explanation after I got this one wrong by choosing E.\n\nThe passage is about a society(Greeks) that failed to recognise that one way(democracy) of ruling a state is superior to another(monarchy). First, the two ways are opposite to each other as in the way each form i.e. democracy by election/voting(the whole society) and monarchy by a family/ies(close circle of people). The highlighted text is the reasoning given for such a conclusion after which it followed. The passage basically suffers for justifying(monarch deciding further course of action of govt.) an action in one way and criticising(individual in the society deciding further course of action) that same action in another. \n\nAnswer D.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

So, as no one present in office has sunburns, no volleyball player came. \nplayed volleyball at beach party &gt; sunburned &gt; no one who played come to office today.\nThe argument doesn't mention if there were people at the party who might not have played at all even if they attended the party. Similarly it is not clear whether people without even participating in the beach party are absent today. So a two way flaw is possible.\n\n(A) Since everyone employed by TRF who was given the opportunity to purchase dental insurance did so and everyone who purchased dental insurance saw a dentist, it is clear that no one who failed to see a dentist is employed by TRF. - WRONG. Any TRF employee, given the opportunity to buy dental insurance, who bought dental insurance visited dentist. Possible flaw is that those who were not given the opportunity may or may not have visited the dentist. There is no two way error here.\n\n(B) Since no one who was promoted during the past year failed to attend the awards banquet, evidently none of the office managers attended the banquet this year since they were all denied promotion. - WRONG. So everyone who got promoted last year attended the awards banquet. No manager attends so no promotion was given to any of them. It is not clear whether there was any manager who was not even eligible for promotion. So someone not eligible who didn't attend cannot be denied promotion.\n\n(C) Since the Donnely report was not finished on time, no one in John’s group could have been assigned to contribute to that report since everyone in John’s group has a reputation for getting assignments in on time. - WRONG. It is very straight forward argument that everyone in John’s group finishes assignments on time. Since no one from John's group worked upon the report it wasn't finished on time. There might be others working on the report but we are not concerned about that.\n\n(D) Everyone with an office on the second floor works directly for the president and, as a result, no one with a second floor office will take a July vacation because no one who works for the president will be able to take time off during July. - CORRECT. So basically people who work for president wouldn't be able to take time off in July. All these people have there offices on 2nd floor and they work directly for president. So people with there office on 2nd floor wouldn't be able to take vacations in July. Working for president &gt; No time off in July &gt; no vacation in July.\n\n(E) Since all of the people who are now on the MXM Corporation payroll have been employed in the same job for the past five years, it is clear that no one who frequently changes jobs is likely to be hired by MXM. - WRONG. Although other options do refer about future but this one, the way it is reasoned, doesn't strictly show that conclusion is definitely possible.\n\nIMO Answer D.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

Mr Diaz, a teacher at school is excellent too. Then we cannot say that he must be a part of the conducting faculty. This is a flaw but not the same flaw.

        "question": "Research has shown that impoverished people in this country buy unhealthy snack foods on a daily basis because this kind of food is generally less expensive than more nutritious food. Therefore, improving the quality of one’s diet is a crucial step for rising out of poverty.\n\nWhich of the following choices uses reasoning that most clearly parallels the reasoning in the argument above?\n",
        "answer": "Edited the question.",
        "explanation": "The evidence in the stimulus is that A (poverty) leads to B (bad diet), while the conclusion is that “not A” (not being poor) leads to “not B” (a good diet). This is not a logical conclusion based on the evidence. By forming the contrapositive of the first premise, we could logically conclude that if you have a good diet, then you are not in poverty. NOTE: The phrase “leads to” in the explanation of the conclusion above can be confusing. We are told that a good diet is crucial, which is like saying that it is necessary. This does NOT mean that a good diet guarantees non-poverty. Instead, non-poverty guarantees a good diet. Therefore, anyone who is not poor has a good diet (“if not A, then not B”), even though the good diet came before the rise out of poverty. It’s like saying that taking the GMAT is a crucial step for going to business school, which translates into “if you want to be in business school, then you must take the GMAT.”\n\nIn the correct choice, the evidence comes after the word “because”: If a bank acted improperly (A), then it advertised on the Internet (B). The conclusion, found at the beginning of the answer, is that proper banks (not A) do not advertise on the Internet (not B). As in the stimulus, we are given “if A then B” as evidence, and “if not A then not B” as an (illogical) conclusion. Note that the conclusion is in the beginning of the argument, while the conclusion in the stimulus is in the second sentence. This difference is irrelevant.\n\n(A) We are told that a weed killer with Zorphon will lead to sick pets, and therefore, if you don’t want sick pets don’t get a weed killer with any chemicals. In other words the evidence is if A (weed killer with Zorphon), then B (sick pets); the conclusion is if not B (not sick pets), then C (get weed killers without ANY chemicals).\n\n(B) The evidence here is that A (unnecessary expenditures) has led to B (rising deficit). The conclusion advises against ANY policies of the last administration, not just unnecessary expenditures.\n\n(C) This argument merely says that a particularly policy – granting discounted tuition to students who have only recently lived in the state – should be changed. There is no cause-and-effect argument, as there is in the stimulus.\n\n(E) The evidence is that people who drive to work drive less on the weekends than people who take public transportation to work. This does not set up a clear cause-and-effect argument, as the stimulus does. Furthermore, it then discusses reducing the number of people who drive to work when they could take public transportation, which is a subset of the first group discussed. Thus, this argument is not parallel to the stimulus.",

Developed countries will cut emissions by 50%, developing countries by 23%, but the 23% cuts \nwill be more demanding on a per-capita basis. The evidence given is that developing countries will need more \nresources to continue growing. Presumably, developed nations will not need their resource consumption to \ngrow at the same rate. Consider each choice:\n\n(A) This choice describes one target of emissions cuts, but in developed nations. It doesn't explain why developing\nnations will be hit harder. (B) This is correct. If emissions in developing countries start at so low a point, they \nwould need to grow very rapidly to get anywhere close to the level of developed nations. As the resource \ndemands in those countries grow, any cut at all--let alone 23%--in emissions would be a great burden. (C) This choice distinguishes some developing nations from other developing nations. The contrast we're concerned with is \ndeveloping vs. developed nations.  (D) This may be true, but it doesn't tell us why emissions cuts would be so much\nmore harmful. If anything, it may mean the cuts would be less harmful, as they would disproportionately touch the \nruling class.

Phone support isn't covered in the passage, but it probably isn't a good thing to make providing phone support less economical. If anything, it certainly doesn't strengthen the argument.

(D) is another irrelevant comparison to other brands; the passage compares the previous MP Tech strategy to the current one.

Be careful of the exact words used in the argument. \n\nPremises:\n- Married women sleep more soundly.\n- Sleeping less than six hours a night makes you 12% more likely to die prematurely than someone who sleeps . \n\nConclusion:\n- Getting married increases a woman's life expectancy.\n\nWhile concluding, the argument is assuming that unmarried women sleep less than 6 hrs while married women sleep upto 8 hrs. Sleeping upto 8 hrs increases your life expectancy compared with sleeping less than 6 hrs. \nThe argument also talks about \"die prematurely\" in premises but concludes about \"higher life expectancy\". Are they linked? we don't know.\nAlso, one premise tells us that married women \"sleep soundly\" while the other talks about \"hours of sleep\". Are they linked? we don't know. \n\nWe need to find strengtheners:\n\nA. Populations with lower odds of premature death have higher life expectancies.\nLinks \"die prematurely\" used in the premises to higher life expectancy. Hence it strengthens the argument. \n\nB. Getting married does not lead to oversleep.\nEstablishes that married women do not sleep for more than 8 hrs. The life expectancy if one sleeps for more than 8 hrs may not be higher. Since the premises mention clearly \"upto 8 hrs\", it brings the amount of sleep for married women in that range. Hence it increases the chances of higher life expectancy for them.  \n\nC. Marriage may introduce lifespan-shortening factors into a woman's life, but these factors tend to be collectively of less consequence than the benefit of sounder sleep.\nThe premises do not tell us how marriage affects other aspects. This tells us that sounder sleep trumps all other factors so it increase the likelihood that married women live longer.\n\nD. Not sleeping soundly is the key reason women who cannot sleep at least eight hours a night fail to do so.\nThis links \"sleeping soundly\" to \"sleeping upto 8 hrs a day\". This strengthens the argument. \n\nE. The psychology of women who marry is, on average, more conducive to sound sleep than that of women who have never married or lost a partner.\nWhy married women sleep soundly does not impact the argument.

The board of directors decided to raise the membership fees and assess a building fee to raise the necessary funds. Toward the end of the year the board discovered that the costs were less than they thought and the fee changes actually gave the center a budget surplus. The board decided to use the surplus funds to buy a new van to shuttle people from the nearby nursing home to the center even though the old van was still serviceable. But before doing so, the board should obtain permission from the members who paid the additional fees.\n\nWhich one of the following policies, if put into effect, would most justify the position advocated above and yet place the least restriction on the use of funds by community centers?\n\n",

It asks you to find the policy that fits the situation.\n\n\nIn this case, you need a policy that allows the community center to use the additional funds as it desires but also satisfies the interests of those who\ndonated the money. \n\n\nYou will look for something similar in your answer options.\n\n\nAnswer A gives the center complete freedom to do what it wants with all the funds but ignores the interests of those who donated the money. Answer B states that the center can do nothing with the money except what the donors approve, which ties the hands of the center while giving too much power to the donors. Answer C hamstrings the center by saying the directors must approve the purpose for all spending in advance, but it does not address funding overages and thus is not helpful in the situation described in the argument. Answer D states that the center should use the money for the intended purpose unless those funds cannot be used for that purpose, in which case the donors should be consulted. This policy fits the situation perfectly. It allows the center to use the money as it sees fit until the allocations are fulfilled. Then, they must consult the donors. Answer E requires that the center return the money, which is in complete contradiction to the situation.

        "answer": "Edited the question.",
        "explanation": "Hey All,\n\nNot trying to start any turf war, but I'd like to weigh in on precisely how you can avoid falling for a trap like B. If you argue that \"there's nothing wrong with it\", you're missing the point of strengthen/weaken questions. In these questions, it's entirely common for multiple answer choices to strengthen or weaken. It's your job to determine which does it the most. Let's talk through all five here and consider the effect they have on the conclusion:\n\n(A) The new council must have the support of the nation’s labor leaders if it is to succeed.\nEffect: No effect. We're trying to talk about Grayson here, not the council. \n\n(B) During his years as a labor leader, Grayson established a record of good relations with business leaders.\nEffect: Small strengthen. He has some good relations. This doesn't speak to his knowledge or experience on the business side of things (notice how it still says \"during his years as a labor leader\").\n\n(C) The chair of the new council must be a person who can communicate directly with the leaders of the nation’s largest labor unions.\nEffect: No effect. We know Grayson has experience, but we don't know if he can \"communicate directly with the leaders of the nation's largest labor unions\", so this doesn't strengthen.\n\n(D) Most of the other members of the new council will be representatives of business management interests.\nEffect: Tiny strengthen. You could argue that Grayson's lack of business knowledge will be made up for by the rest of the council...but that's a stretch.\n\n(E) An understanding of the needs and problems of labor is the only qualification necessary for the job of chairing the new council.\nEffect: Huge strengthen. Now we know that the knowledge Grayson has is ALL he needs to be good at his job.\n\nMake sure, when you're practicing, to think deeply about how each answer choice relates to the conclusion. Even stretches (as with D) will help you really think through the question, and will seldom lead you to the wrong answer.\n\nHope that helps!",

        "question": "Critics of the new Clean Energy Bill argue that it will lead to higher energy costs due to the implementation of expensive renewable energy technologies. Since the bill's passage, we have replaced a number of conventional power plants with renewable energy projects and the average cost of electricity from these renewable sources has consistently been lower than the national average each year, which demonstrates that the bill has effectively contributed to reducing overall electricity costs.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument in the policy speech?\n",
        "answer": "Question Modified from Original due to problem with Average setup",
        "explanation": "­\n\n\n\nThe argument could be weakened if the cost of electricity produced by the conventional plants that were replaced by renewable sources was lower. Let's say these old (and polluting) power plants were generating super cheap electricity. This would be mean replacing them would actually drive the average cost of electricity higher which would in turn make it more expensive and contradict the argument that it has been reducing the overall energy costs. This statement helps clarify and strengthen the argument by indicating that such situation cannot happen.\n\n\n\nThis answer choice is irrelevant as we are not concerned with the setup costs. The answer choice wants you to go down an assumption staircase that if the setup cost is lower, then perhaps the overall cost would be lower but we don’t know how much lower it is (is it lower than conventional sources? Maybe but maybe not). Also, if we are making assumptions, what about operating costs? This option requires a number of assumptions and cannot be the answer. Eliminate.\n\n\n\nB) does not strengthen the claim about the ongoing impact of the bill on current electricity costs compared to non-renewable sources. We just know that the cost of electricity was running up and it is not clear what impact it has on the bill or the claim. Eliminate.\n\n\n\nC) actually weakens the argument by suggesting problems with some renewable energy projects, contrary to the speech's claim of effectiveness. Eliminate.\n\n\n\nThis is a trap answer choice. It tells us that areas outside of the influence of the Clean Energy Bill have seen their costs rise but it tell us nothing about the Clean Energy Bill areas - maybe they rose even more. This answer choice could be a contender if it compared the 2 areas but it does not, as it just tells one side of the story. This answer choice is designed to make you combine information from other answer choices (big no-no on the GMAT) and wants you to think that it means that the Clean Energy Bill therefore worked to reduce the energy costs but we don’t know how the rise in other areas compares to the clean energy bill areas.

        "question": "The London Board of Trade limited the quantity of pound sterling banknotes permitted in circulation in the American colonies, citing fear of devaluation induced by overprinting. The Board also denied the necessity of paper money, considering the ever-increasing colonial exports purchased by foreign nations that rendered payments in gold and silver. However, in 1749, Governor Glen of South Carolina contended that access to more paper currency was essential because there was actually a deficit of gold and silver. This shortfall led to difficulties in exchanging goods for these precious metals, forcing many merchants to earn their success only through continued reliance on the barter system. Such a system limited the colonists' ability to obtain certain goods for which they had no apparently comparable trade, severely hampering widespread economic growth in the colonies.\n\n\nWhich of the following statements, if true, would most strengthen Governor Glen's argument in favor of paper currency?\n",

        "explanation": "We see that the researchers have concluded the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for that conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nWe see that the researchers have reasoned that, since volunteers predicted that they would be more satisfied with an assortment of snacks but afterward reported greater satisfaction if they had received only one type of snack, corn chips, people tend to mistakenly believe that they prefer variety to monotony in their diets.\n\nThe correct answer will make the support for the researchers' conclusion stronger.\n\n\n\nIf anything, this choice weakens the argument. After all, if corn chips were the volunteers' favorite snack, then maybe the volunteers didn't report greater satisfaction because they prefer monotony. Maybe what they prefer is corn chips.\n\nIt's true that the volunteers who received only corn chips' snacks still would have been monotonous, but this choice seems to provide another possible reason why they reported greater satisfaction.\n\nSo, if anything, this choice does the opposite of what we need.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is an irrelevant comparison choice.\n\nThe argument involves a comparison of people's satisfaction with two types of diets. How variety in diet compares with variety in other experiences in terms of satisfaction has no bearing on the reasoning of this argument.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThere's no reason to believe that, if the the volunteers WERE informed beforehand that those who did not receive an assortment of snacks would receive only corn chips, the results  of the experiment would have been less reliable or would provide less support for the researchers' conclusion. After all, even if the volunteers had been informed beforehand, their predictions about what type of diet they would find more satisfying would still have been incorrect, and the results of the experiment still would support the researchers' conclusion.\n\nSo, the fact that they were NOT informed beforehand doesn't make any difference in the support for the researchers' conclusion.\n\nTo avoid choosing a choice like this one, we have to be careful not to make up an unsupported story that makes information that has no effect on the argument seem to strengthen it.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nIf anything, this choice weakens the argument.\n\nAfter all, if what this choice says is true, then the volunteers who received only corn chips for snacks may not really have had monotony in their diets. They had monotony in their snacks, but they may have had variety in their diets overall since they were free to eat a wide assortment of foods for their main meals.\n\nSo, this choice casts doubt on the researchers' conclusion that people tend to mistakenly believe that they prefer variety in their diets. After all, those who reported greater satisfaction after receiving only corn chips for snacks may NOT have been mistaken because their may have been variety in their diets.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice helps to confirm that people do not prefer variety to monotony and suggests that they prefer monotony to variety. After all, it shows that, even though corn chips are less appetizing (appealing to eat) than other snacks, people STILL were more satisfied with only corn chips than with greater variety.\n\nWhy would they be more satisfied with something less appetizing? Some other factor must have offset the fact that corn chips are less appetizing to make the volunteers more satisfied, and that offsetting factor appears to have been the monotony.\n\nAnother way of looking at this choice is that it eliminates an alternative cause for the greater satisfaction of the people who received only corn chips. After all, it serves to eliminate the possibility that they were more satisfied because corn chips are more appetizing.\n\nEither way, this choice strengthens the support for the researchers' conclusion.\n\nThe correct answer is (E).",

Although the Interviewers claimed to be able to predict which Respondents were lying based on their body language, their predictions were —that is, not accurate. \n\n \n\nWhat assumptions are the researchers making? The researchers conducted this experiment in a way that introduces at least two concerns. First, there is no stated attempt to create a control group in the experiment. A better version of the experiment could have included a group of Interviewers and Respondents who were given no special directions on how to reply to the questions. Second, the researchers draw a conclusion about  from one experiment conducted with conditions that differ substantially from real-life situations. \n\nAnother possible concern may be the participants themselves. There is no mention of whether the Interviewers have received even cursory instructions of  body language might indicate whether a person is lying. What if body language is a reliable indicator of lying, but only when evaluated by a trained eye?\n\n\n\n(A) This answer choice suggests that the Interviewers may have been more attuned to the body language of the Respondents. However, if anything, this answer choice would suggest that the Interviewers’ predictions should have been more accurate. Since the predictions were not accurate, despite expectations, this answer choice actually strengthens the argument. \n\n(B) People who are lying maintain continuous eye contact; what about people who are telling the truth? Even if one assumes that liars intentionally maintain eye contact and truth-tellers do not, that interpretation would strengthen the argument by reinforcing the expectation that body language would be an effective tool to determine whether a person was lying.\n\n This answer choice may seem irrelevant. Of course people in real life do not normally speak the truth or lie 100% of the time! But if people do not adhere to the strict roles of the experiment in real life, then the results of this experiment cannot be convincingly extrapolated to real-life. In other words, the experiment was too artificial to serve as an everyday life substitute, so the author’s conclusion is weakened.\n\n(D) If anything, this answer choice would strengthen the argument, because it removes one potential variable from the experiment. If some of the participants were previously acquainted before the experiment, then some of the participants might have non-body language related clues to tell when someone was lying or telling the truth.\n\n(E) If anything, this choice would strengthen the argument, because it removes one potential variable from the experiment. For example, what if the questions touched on very personal beliefs held by participants? The emotional impact of the question itself might somehow distort a Respondent’s behavior and make body language a less useful clue to whether that Respondent was lying. This answer choice removes that possible concern and would actually increase the expectation that body language would be a reliable indicator of whether a person is lying. Since body language was not a reliable indicator in this experiment, the researchers’ conclusion would be more convincing.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "The people of Prohibitionland are considering banning the service of alcoholic beverages in restaurants to curb unruly behavior on the part of its residents. Proprietors of restaurants in Prohibitionland are protesting the ban on the grounds that it will reduce their revenues and profits. However, several provinces in Prohibitionland enacted restrictions on alcoholic beverages last year, and the sales taxes paid by the restaurants in those provinces rose by an average of 50 percent.  In contrast, the sales taxes paid by restaurants located in areas of Prohibitionland that did not have any restrictions rose by an average of 30 percent. \n\nWhich of the following, if true, supports the restaurant proprietors’ economic stance against the ban? \n",

To do so, we need to explain the increase in tax revenues in \"restriction\" counties. The only way to do this is to exploit the distinction between \"restriction\" and \"ban\". Remember, you're not allowed to bring in outside knowledge, but you are allowed to know the  of the words used! A restriction is less, well, restrictive than a full ban.\n\nOnly (D) exploits this issue in the counterpoint.

        "question": "Archaeologist: A skeleton of a North American mastodon that became extinct at the peak of the Ice Age was recently discovered. It contains a human-made projectile dissimilar to any found in that part of Eurasia closest to North America.Thus, since Eurasians did not settle in North America until shortly before the peak of the Ice Age, the first Eurasian settlers in North America probably came from a more distant part of Eurasia.\n\nWhich one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the archaeologist’s argument?\n\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The stimulus sets up an interesting argument that appears fairly reasonable. A mastodon skeleton has been found containing a human-made projectile dissimilar to those of the part of Eurasia closest to North America and because Eurasians did not settle in North America until shortly before the peak of the Ice Age, the first Eurasian settlers of North America probably came from a more distant part of Eurasia than the area nearest North America. To make a very rough analogy using dialects, it is like a resident of Washington, D.C. saying, “The visitors we just met did not sound like they were from Virginia, so they must be from a much more distant part of the U.S.” Reading that rough analogy, you can see that the speaker has assumed that the visitors are from the U.S. Of course, that does not have to be the case—they could be from England or France or elsewhere. The same form of assumption has occurred in the argument, and the author has assumed that the projectile is of Eurasian origin. \n\n This answer hurts the argument by indicating that the projectile is apparently not Eurasian, suggesting that the first Eurasian settlers could have come from any part of Eurasia, including the area closest to North America. \n\nAnswer choice (B): This is the most attractive wrong answer, but regardless, this answer does not hurt the argument. Some students attempt to conclude that since the people were nomadic, they could have moved to areas farther away and found projectiles like the one in the mastodon. However, even though these individuals remained nomadic, they were apparently nomadic within the area of Eurasia closest to North America because the answer clearly states, “The people who occupied the Eurasia area closest to North America...” Hence, they did not necessarily occupy other areas and this answer does not hurt the argument. \n\nAnswer choice (C): This Opposite answer supports the argument by showing that the projectile in the mastodon was not a one-time, anomalous occurrence. If other, similar projectiles come to light, then the author’s position would be strengthened. \n\nAnswer choice (D): This Opposite answer supports the argument by connecting other artifacts of the same age as the projectile to parts of Eurasia more distant than the area of Eurasia closest to North America. This adds further evidence to the idea that the first Eurasian settlers of North America probably came from a more distant part of Eurasia than the area nearest North America. \n\nAnswer choice (E): This Opposite answer supports the argument by indicating that the part of Eurasia closest to North America may not have been inhabited just before the Ice Age. If this area was uninhabitable, then it is more likely that settlers coming to North America came from more distant regions.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

Further, a DNA comparison suggests a Polynesian origin for a chicken bone unearthed at Chile's El Arenal site, where other artifacts have been dated to over six hundred years ago.\n\nWhich of the following would, if true, most seriously weaken the anthropologists' argument as reported above?\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "We see that the anthropologists have argued, in other words, that their conclusion is, the following:\n\n\n\nThe anthropologists provide two pieces of evidence to support their conclusion:\n\n\n\nThe question asks the following:\n\n\n\nThis question is different from many other GMAT Weaken questions, whose arguments support their conclusions in one main way rather that with two different types of evidence. All the same, having seen how the conclusion is supported, we can look for a choice that somehow weakens the support provided by one or both pieces of evidence.\n\n\n\nIf anything, this choice strengthens, rather than weakens, the argument.\n\nAfter all, the fact that sweet potatoes up to one thousand years old from Polynesian archaeological sites most likely originated in South America indicates that, as long ago as a thousand years, people traveled between South America and Polynesia, which provides further reason to believe that the chicken bone found at Chile's El Arenal site is of Polynesian origin and predates the arrival of Europeans around five hundred years ago.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice has a vibe of weakening the argument. By saying that the ages of other chicken bones have been established, it attempts to give us the impression that the piece of evidence we have that involves a chicken bone somehow does not support the anthropologist's conclusion.\n\nHowever, the truth is that this choice has no effect on the argument. After all, it doesn't say how old the other chicken bones are. So, we don't know whether their ages indicate that they are from before or after Europeans brought chickens to South America. In other words, the fact that the ages of the other bones have been established is irrelevant without information on what those ages are.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nAs is the case with choice (A), if anything, this choice strengthens, rather than weakens, the argument.\n\nAfter all, the fact that ancient Polynesian canoes may have been used for voyages to places as far away from Polynesia as South America is further reason to believe that the chicken bone found at Chile's El Arenal site is of Polynesian origin. After all, if the canoes could have been used for such voyages, then we have some confirmation that it's possible that the chicken bone found at the site is from Polynesia.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice weakens the support provided by the first piece of evidence, \"European accounts dating from the arrival of Europeans in South America around five hundred years ago that suggest that the Inca had already incorporated chickens into religious ceremonies.\"\n\nThis choice indicates that, while it's true that there are European accounts dating from the arrival of Europeans in South America that suggest that the Inca had already incorporated chickens into religious ceremonies, that fact may not indicate that there were chickens in South America before the Europeans arrived because the Europeans who provided those accounts may have mistaken ducks for chickens.\n\nNotice that this choice doesn't conflict with the facts of the argument. It doesn't say that there are not any European accounts that suggest that the Inca had already incorporated chickens into religious ceremonies when the Europeans arrived. Rather, it weakens the connection between the fact that those accounts exist and the conclusion by indicating that the accounts may not be accurate.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThis choice has absolutely no effect on the argument. All it says is basically that travel in one direction is just as likely to have occurred as travel in the other. It doesn't tell us how likely travel in either direction is to have occurred. So, it doesn't meaningfully affect what we know about the situation since it does not help to confirm whether travel between Polynesia and South America occurred.\n\nEliminate.",

While such a development may emit violent reverberations through the art world, even those museums that have a wealth of the Flemish artist in their collections should not be overly concerned. Hundreds of this Flemish artist’s works were tested to determine whether they were forgeries, yet only a slim few turned out to be actual forgeries. Thus, the master’s reputation as one of the greatest artists humanity has ever produced will surely remain undiminished.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the art historian’s conclusion?\n",

        "explanation": "In this question, both (C) and (D) weaken the conclusion but I went with (C) because it is much more straight forward i.e. you don't need to assume anything to weaken the conclusion if (C) is correct. Let me analyze it in detail:\n\nPremises:\nComputer analysis has revealed that a few of a famous Flemish artist’s works are forgeries\nBut very few turned out to be actual forgeries when 100s were tested (so basically it is saying that only a very small %age were forgeries)\n\nConclusion: \nThe master’s reputation as one of the greatest artists humanity has ever produced will surely remain undiminished.\n\nThe conclusion is about master's reputation remaining undiminished. We need to weaken it i.e. we need to select the option that diminishes his reputation.\n\n(C) Some of the works upon which Flemish artist’s standing rests were identified by the computer analysis to be the work of de Hory. \nSome works on which the artist's standing rests were forgeries. So even though a very small %age were forgeries, the ones which are forgeries are the ones on which the artist's standing depends. Then obviously, his standing/reputation will be diminished. This certainly weakens the conclusion.\n\n(B) Many of the Flemish artist’s well known portraits are in the collection of private owners and were therefore not subjected to computer analysis. \nThere is no reason to assume that the collections of private owners will have many more forgeries than those of museums. The argument doesn't say that all his paintings were tested. It only says that many were tested and very few turned out to be forgeries. It doesn't matter whether the ones owned by museums were tested or the ones in the collection of private owners were tested. Ideally, we might believe that museums are more thorough in their research before they buy/accept  paintings and hence they will have fewer forgeries but it is an assumption we need to make. \n\n(D) Some museums, worrying that their most prized painting from the Flemish artist would be deemed forgeries, and thus lose value, only offered up the artist’s lesser known works for computer analysis. \nThis tells us that important paintings (the paintings on which the artist's reputation depends) were not tested. If this is the case, we cannot conclude that the artist's reputation is undiminished but to say that his reputation is actually diminished, we need to assume that there will be forgeries in the works on which his standing depends i.e. in the most prized collection.

        "question": "­Researchers have found that, allowing for variations attributable to the size of a company’s workforce and to the company’s business sector, companies that have low staff turnover tend to have greater labor productivity than companies with higher turnover. Since high staff turnover negatively affects workers’ sense of community and identification with company goals, clearly these adverse effects on staff attitudes are the cause of the decline in productivity as turnover increases.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?\n",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "­\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is the following:\n\n\n\nThe support for the conclusion is the following:\n\n\n\nSo, the author has gone from the fact that high turnover has adverse effects on staff attitudes to the conclusion that the cause of \"the decline in productivity as turnover increases\" is \"adverse effects on staff attitudes.\"\n\n\n\nThis is a Weaken question, and the correct answer will somehow weaken the support for or cast doubt on the conclusion.\n\n\n\nThis choice casts doubt on the conclusion.\n\nAfter all, if this choice is true, then we have an alternative cause for the decline in productivity as turnover increases.\n\nIf this choice is true, then it may not be that adverse effects on staff attitudes cause the decline, and it may instead be that the decline occurs because laying off workers and hiring new ones require staff to spend time on activities that do not immediately contribute to output.\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nWe can often weaken an argument by presenting an alternative cause for an effect. So, this choice could seem to weaken the argument because it presents a cause for the effect \"an increase in staff turnover.\"\n\nAt the same time, this choice doesn't weaken this argument in that way because the effect the conclusion is about is not \"an increase in staff turnover.\" It's \"the decline in productivity as turnover increases.\"\n\nSince this choice doesn't present an alternative cause for the decline in productivity, it doesn't weaken the argument by presenting an alternative cause.\n\nAlternatively, this choice could seem to weaken the argument because this choice describes a situation that contrasts with the pattern that the argument is about.\n\nThe argument is about a general pattern: higher turnover is associated with lower productivity.\n\nIn contrast, this choice describes a situation in which higher turnover is associated with higher productivity, or at least with the process of achieving higher productivity.\n\nAt the same time, this choice does not weaken the argument because all this choice is saying is that there can be an exception to the general pattern when a certain type of process, \"introduction of technology intended to increase labor productivity,\" occurs.\n\nThe argument's conclusion is that the reason for the general pattern is that adverse effects on staff attitudes cause of a decline in productivity as turnover increases.\n\nThe fact that there can be an exception to the general pattern does not mean that the argument's conclusion about the cause of that general pattern is not correct.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is an irrelevant comparison choice.\n\nAfter all, the fact that staff turnover tends to be somewhat higher in large companies than in relatively small companies doesn't clearly indicate anything about the cause of the decline in productivity as turnover increases.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice masquerades as a weakener by weakening the case for a conclusion other than the conclusion of this argument.\n\nIt weakens the case for the conclusion that staff morale declines only because of turnover issues.\n\nThat's not the conclusion we need to cast doubt on.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is an irrelevant comparison choice.\n\nAfter all, the fact that workers’ sense of community and degree of identification with company goals both tend to be stronger in relatively small companies than in large companies doesn't clearly indicate anything about the cause of the decline in productivity as turnover increases.\n\nEliminate.\n\n A­",

        "question": "Most doctors dismiss male pattern baldness as a problem of heredity. A new theory, however, postulates that baldness can also result from number of external factors, such as a stressful urban lifestyle. Supporters of this new theory point out that baldness is twice as common among male who live in cities as it is among those who live elsewhere.\n\nWhich of the following most weakens the new theory described above?\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Here is my take on this question. I hope others may find it useful.\n\nI often talk to my students about the role of  in the problem-solving process for CR and RC questions. That is, what is the  argument, and on what pillars or premises may it stand? To knock down the argument, you need to take out a pillar. Here, the  in question correlates . The evidence (i.e. pillar)? Again, stick to the  phrasing of the passage:  to test whether heredity or external factors may be leading to the condition.\n\nFull confession: That is typically about as far as I go with pre-thinking. I used to do more, but too often, my brainstormed ideas did not fall in line with the responses, and I ended up spending too much time on the questions. For me,  started to lead to the answers much more efficiently, so I adapted my approach. On to the responses, then, with an eye on disproving what we can, rather than looking to find the one correct response.\n\nAnalysis: As others have pointed out, this has , not to mention that it does not take into account where bald men live, a necessary condition to weaken the argument. \n\nAnalysis: Do we have bald men living in large cities here? Yes, we do, at least by extension. If  men in general who are born in large cities live out their days there, then that would include bald men, our target group. This does touch on the evidence cited that, again, . What are we to make of the part about their reason for staying in those cities, . This could provide an alternative to what the new theory proposes, namely that a  is causing city-dwelling men to lose their hair. It could be true instead that bald men have offspring who stay close to home and, in turn, pass along their genes for baldness to their offspring, who, if this reason provided at the end of the response holds true, will also likely stay close to home and produce the next generation of bald men. Is this the answer I was expecting? No. Can I find a reason to dismiss it outright? No, I cannot, and that is the crucial part. \n\nAnalysis: Ah, the tempting answer. The problem is, the response says , nor does it offer where they may move to pursue this . You cannot assume that the city-dwelling population in the survey or whatever observation has established that city folk versus those from less urban environments comprised mostly men in the 55+ category. Moreover, if you assume that they move away from the city to retire and rest, then why would more bald men be found in the city, by proportion, as opposed to ? Finally, since when do  dictate where people actually live? I wish I could live in Hawai'i, and I can even dream about it, but that thought will not somehow affect a survey result or an observation about the male population of Hawai'i. At least choice (B) provided an action in addition to the thought. \n\nAnalysis: The evidence cited suggests as much. Read in an altered manner, it says that . Of note is that there is a comparison between men who live in cities and those who live outside them, but what is presented does little to weaken the new theory that male pattern baldness can be explained by external factors rather than hereditary factors. \n\nAnalysis: I kind of like the way this one ties into the hereditary notion of reproduction. On the other hand, it does . If it deviates from the linear-thinking pathway, then it does not satisfy the given task. This response applies equally to all bald men, regardless of where they live. \n\nThe term  is bandied about ad nauseam in the tutoring realm, and it means very little until you can connect the strategy to something meaningful. You have to rewire your thinking with these GMAT™ questions and . Instead of searching for the needle in the haystack, I suggest burning the chaff and finding the needle. Go into these questions with  in mind, and it becomes easier not to fall for a distraction.\n\nGood luck to all of you in your studies.\n\n- Andrew\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The consumer advocate’s proposed rule is fairly straightforward: Instructions should be written in such a way as to make assembly much easier with the instructions than without. Our task is to show that this rule “cannot always be followed.”\n\nA) No, this wouldn’t be a reason not to adopt the consumer advocate’s rule. This is probably why the consumer advocate wants to adopt the rule in the first place! Maybe today’s instructions are terrible, and the consumer advocate is hoping that his rule will cause the instructions to be improved. This doesn’t show that the rule cannot be followed, just that it is not  being followed.\n\nB) This is irrelevant. The fact that some folks are always going to pay for assembly doesn’t ruin the rule that assembly should be easier with the instructions than without.\n\nC) Yep. If this is true, then it’s  “very easy” to assemble products even without looking at the instructions. For example, assembling a lamp usually entails screwing two pieces together, then screwing in a light bulb. That’s pretty goddamn easy. If that’s already “very easy” without any instructions at all, then how could instructions make it “much easier”? This scenario shows that the consumer advocate’s rule can’t  be followed. It might still be a good rule in most circumstances, but it would be silly to apply the rule to products that are “very easy.”\n\nD) This would make the consumer advocate very happy. He would respond to this with, “Yes, today’s instructions are great, and my rule would help to keep them that way.” This could only show that the consumer advocate’s rule is currently being followed, it certainly doesn’t show that the rule cannot be followed.\n\nE) This is probably true, but is also irrelevant. The consumer advocate would respond to this answer with, “Of course some people don’t look at the instructions unless they need help, but I want the instructions to be as good as possible when/if they  look at them.” Perhaps an even bigger problem with this answer is that it’s only about “some” consumers. Since “some” means “one or more,” this is a very soft answer. Suppose there is one guy who never looks at the instructions. Does that really hurt the advocate’s rule? The advocate would say, “True, some people will  look at the instructions, but my rule was only that ‘most’ people should find assembly much easier with the instructions than without. There is room for a couple exceptions.”\n\nOur answer is C, because it’s the only one that shows that the rule is impossible to follow in some circumstances.­\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

Speaking of pondering, let's acknowledge the fact that this is a weaken question so we should focus on the conclusion of the argument, and I would suggest that when the prompt says \"undermine the argument/reasoning\" we need to go deeper than just weaken.\n\nI am just giving my try, to help explain what I think and I am open for debate so that you can also scrutinise my reasoning.\n\n So let's focus on the conclusion by companies executives, who states :\nIMO, the executives fail to address all the possibilities that could be the reason for what the situation is in the company. The executives may have incomplete information or they rely on evidence (here, gym reports) as the only source of data and thus, the correct answer choice would introduce new possibilities. \n\nThis is exactly what option E does. Let me reproduce it again :\nThis choice states that ALL the employees are allowed to select between the two plans available  and this means that all of them have equal opportunity to select one plan, which they think would be better financially. Every employee knows about the financial incentive  (there is a reason I am stating and underlining it twice) that the variable plan offers, but still some go with the fixed plan (maybe because they know they are too lazy to attend the fitness classes or for some other reason) and others go with the variable plan. So it would be incorrect to say that modest financial incentive motivated these employees to \n\nAlso, it may be the case that those who chose to go with variable plan ($110) were already involved in fitness activities (reverse causality of what is stated in the passage) and thus, financial incentive was just a cherry on the cake for them. Maybe these employees, who took up variable plan, were already motivated to take fitness seriously. This reasoning completely wrecks the executives claim of financial incentive.\n\nI hope this helps. \n\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.gmatclub.com/cdn/files/forum/images/smilies/1f642.png\" class=\"forumSmileyItem\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" alt=\":)\">",

        "question": "The labeling of otherwise high-calorie foods as “sugar-free,” based on the replacement of all sugar by artificial sweeteners, should be prohibited by law. Such a prohibition is indicated because many consumers who need to lose weight will interpret the label “sugar-free” as synonymous with “low in calories” and harm themselves by building weight-loss diets around foods labeled “sugar-free.” Manufacturers of sugar-free foods are well aware of this tendency on the part of consumers.\n\nWhich one of the following, if true, provides the strongest basis for challenging the conclusion in the passage?\n\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "I was torn between options A and B.\nAlthough I know that option A is more of a \"response\" instead of a \"challenge\", which the question is asking for, I ultimately chose option A over B because option B talks ONLY about \"diabetics\" - a very specific sub-group of people-, whereas the argument talks about people who are concerned about weight loss in general.  Consider the structure of the argument:\n\nIf food manufacturers would respond to the ban by reducing calories, then consumers attempting to lose weight would benefit from the ban. Rather than providing a basis to challenge the author’s conclusion that the “sugar-free” label should be banned, this strengthens the author’s argument by providing an additional benefit of the ban. Eliminate (A).\n\nthat contain no sugar by reference to product labels that expressly state that the product contains no sugar.[/quote]\nThe author's reasoning behind his/her conclusion is that  are harming themselves because of the sugar-free labels.\n\nBut what if there are other people who  from the labels? (B) tells us that there is such a group of people. Diabetics need to know whether the product is sugar-free. So, even if the labels are unhelpful for people who are trying to lose weight, they are very helpful for diabetics.\n\nThis new information provides a strong challenge to the conclusion that the labels should be banned. Let's keep (B).\n\nPerhaps (C) indicates that it will take some time for the ban to have its intended effect. But even if consumers are SOMETIMES slow to notice changes, they will eventually notice the changes. And this could be an instance in which they are not slow to notice changes. So, (C) does not present a valid challenge to the argument, and we can eliminate it.\n\n(D) indicates that, when consumers who need to lose weight begin a sugar-free diet, they will persist with the diet as long as they have been warned not to expect quick results. But the author is not interested in whether consumers continue with sugar-free diets. Rather, he/she is concerned with the implications of a “sugar-free” label on otherwise high-calorie foods. For that reason, (D) does not challenge the passage. Eliminate (D).\n\n(E) indicates that  appears on a label is less important than  something appears on a label. So, in the context of the passage, whether “sugar-free” appears on a label is less important than the prominence of “sugar-free” on the label. But whether “sugar-free” appear on a label could still be important. And (E) doesn’t change the fact that manufacturers seem to be misleading consumers. So, (E) provides little basis to challenge the conclusion, and we can eliminate it.\n\n(B) is the only answer choice remaining, and it is correct.

The climatologists hypothesize that when the fluctuations occur, Earth passes through clouds of cosmic dust that enters the atmosphere; the cosmic dust thereby dims the Sun, resulting in an ice age. They concede, however, that though cosmic dust clouds are common, the clouds would have to be particularly dense in order to have this effect.\n\nEach of the following, if true, would lend support to the climatologists’ hypothesis EXCEPT:\n",

        "explanation": "To support the climatologists' hypothesis, you need to connect the Earth's passage through dust to the lowering of temperatures that characterises the ice age(s).

Ultimately safety is enhanced --&gt; hence public will be safe in future --&gt; thus this option does not even scratch the conclusion\n- Wrong\n\n(B) The newspaper was correct in claiming that public safety in the event of severe weather would be enhanced if new sirens were purchased.\n- As noted there are some things which we cannot question in an argument. The given option is one of those things.\n- Wrong\n\n(C) The local company from which replacement parts for the old sirens were purchased last year was the only company in the area that sold them.\n- Tricky but not correct. Even if there are other companies that sold them our major concern is whether the parts were difficult to obtain. \n- This question does not shed light on the difficulty of obtaining the parts. \n- Number of companies manufacturing the parts does not guarantee the easy availability of parts\n- Close but wrong\n \n(D) Replacement parts for the old sirens will be difficult to obtain if the government cannot obtain them from the company it purchased them from last year.\n- Correct. If parts are difficult to obtain --&gt; old sirens will be replaced by new sirens --&gt; public will be safe\n- Correct\n\n(E) Because the local company from which replacement parts had been purchased went out of business, the only available parts are of such inferior quality that use of them would make the sirens less reliable.\n- Again we need to focus on the ease of availability of replacement parts.

        "question": "Educational Theorist: Recent editorials have called for limits on the amount of homework assigned to schoolchildren younger than 12. They point out that free-time activities play an important role in childhood development and that homework in large quantities can severely restrict children's free time, hindering their development. But the actual average homework time for children under 12—little more than 30 minutes per night—leaves plenty of free time. In reality, therefore, the editorials' rationale cannot justify the restriction they advocate.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, would most seriously call into question the educational theorist's conclusion?\n",

As I so often do with CR questions, I took a peek at the question first so that I would know how to interpret the passage.\n\nThis is a weakener, and we need to put a dent in the conclusion of the educational theorist in particular. Thus, we have to stick strictly to that conclusion and any premises on which it is built. What does the passage tell us?\n\n\nOkay, the passage itself is not hard to follow.\n\nSentence 1 provides the backdrop:  are calling for limits on homework for schoolchildren under 12.\n\nSentence 2 tells us why: too much homework = not enough time for , thereby hindering development. (\"All work and no play make...\")\n\nSentence 3 provides a counterargument, starting with , appealing to an  amount of homework time for children under 12. Apparently, since this number is about 30 minutes per night, children should have plenty of free time on their hands.\n\nSentence 4 is the conclusion, with a nice  tossed in for good measure. In short, the educational theorist concludes that the people writing the editorials are unjustified in their call , given that average amount of time such schoolchildren spend doing homework each night. To weaken the conclusion, we need to find justification for those homework restrictions.\n\n teachers give as homework assignments work of a kind that research suggests is most effective educationally when done in class. trap. The majority of the time you see it, it will lead you down a dangerous path. Here,  could mean two, and if just a handful of teachers were assigning this kind of homework, then there would be no need to call for restrictions on homework in general. Besides, the argument is based on children under 12 needing more free time at home. The type of homework assigned is not taken into account, just the volume of it.\n\n. positive developmental effect on children, one that was discussed in the passage, then that would weaken the position of the homework-restriction advocates.

This could represent a very small percentage of homework assignments pertaining to the target group, and think about it, if homework assignments were helpful to development, as the notion is presented in the passage, then this new information would weaken the position of the people writing the editorials, in fact the opposite of what we are aiming to do.

How do we understand the whole stellar life cycle? The Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram sorts stars into different categories depending on their properties. Stellar clusters are collections of stars all the same age. The location of all the stars in a single stellar cluster on an HR diagram demonstrates the categories for stars at that particular age, and a comparison of plots on the HR diagram for multiple stellar clusters indicates how the different kinds of stars change over the course of their life cycles. The achievement is analogous to that of an imagined intelligent mayfly that, despite being alive for only a single day, is able to figure out the entire human life cycle by observing __________________.\n\nWhich of the following most logically completes the passage?\n",

And as is the case most years, the hardest questions are the prep company questions that don't have a correct OA, so of course most people answering correctly get the question \"wrong\". Here we're asked how a mayfly might understand the \"entire human life cycle\". Human life doesn't start at age 27, or whatever age the college reunions in answer C might start at. So a mayfly can't understand the \"entire human life cycle\" by observing people 27 and older, and if we're filling in the blank logically, we can't just ignore those words. The best answer to my thinking is E, because then we find groups of people (rather than one individual person, as in D) of all ages (not just some ages, as in B). This intelligent mayfly can then cluster the people by age itself, just as the intelligent astronomers have done with stars to make their HR plots -- I don't see a reason here that we need an answer that indicates that people have already been organized into age groups (because the sentence begins with the nebulous word \"the achievement\", and it's not clear what \"the achievement\" refers to, precisely -- clustering the stars, then understanding them, or simply understanding them once the clusters have been made?).\n\nIt could be a good question if it were refined, but as it's written, I don't think the OA is justifiable.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________",

Speed = tickets.\n\nThe conclusion drawn above depends on which of the following assumptions?\n(A) Drivers who equip their vehicles with radar detectors are less likely to be ticketed for exceeding the speed limit than are drivers who do not.\nPROBLEM: This is the opposite of what we want. The people with radar are clearly getting tickets MORE often than those who do not.\n\n(B) Drivers who are ticketed for exceeding the speed limit are more likely to exceed the speed limit regularly than are drivers who are not ticketed.\nANSWER: This is dangerous, because most people ASSUME this already (if you get tickets more, it's because you're speeding more). But remember this is the GMAT, we cannot assume this. We can't jump from \"more tickets\" to \"more speeding\", as much as our logic nodes may want it.\n\n(C) The number of vehicles that were ticketed for exceeding the speed limit was greater than the number of vehicles that were equipped with radar detectors.\nPROBLEM: We don't need to assume this to make our conclusion. Try negating it, and seeing if that destroys the conclusion (this is a way to test correct assumptions). \"The number of vehicles that were ticketed for exceeding the speed limit was NOT greater than the number of vehicles that were equipped with radar detectors.\" So what? It could still be true that people with radar are speeding more.\n\n(D) Many of the vehicles that were ticketed for exceeding the speed limit were ticketed more than once in the time period covered by the report.\nPROBLEM: Even if this might work, it's the OPPOSITE of what we'd want. We'd want to assume that these people were only ticketed ONCE, because if the same person was ticketed multiple times, he might only be one person, in which case the conclusion doesn't work. But the negation of this is: \"Many of the vehicles that were ticketed for exceeding the speed limit were NOT ticketed more than once in the time period covered by the report.\" That HELPS the argument, see? Now we can possibly infer that there are MORE PEOPLE with radar speeding, because there are no duplicates.\n\n(E) Drivers on Maryland highways exceeded the speed limit more often than did drivers on other state highways not covered in the report.\nPROBLEM: Who cares about stuff outside of Maryland?\n\nHope that helps!\n\n-t",

Although the Interviewers claimed to be able to predict which Respondents were lying based on their body language, their predictions were —that is, not accurate. \n\n \n\nWhat assumptions are the researchers making? The researchers conducted this experiment in a way that introduces at least two concerns. First, there is no stated attempt to create a control group in the experiment. A better version of the experiment could have included a group of Interviewers and Respondents who were given no special directions on how to reply to the questions. Second, the researchers draw a conclusion about  from one experiment conducted with conditions that differ substantially from real-life situations. \n\nAnother possible concern may be the participants themselves. There is no mention of whether the Interviewers have received even cursory instructions of  body language might indicate whether a person is lying. What if body language is a reliable indicator of lying, but only when evaluated by a trained eye?\n\n\n\n(A) This answer choice suggests that the Interviewers may have been more attuned to the body language of the Respondents. However, if anything, this answer choice would suggest that the Interviewers’ predictions should have been more accurate. Since the predictions were not accurate, despite expectations, this answer choice actually strengthens the argument. \n\n(B) People who are lying maintain continuous eye contact; what about people who are telling the truth? Even if one assumes that liars intentionally maintain eye contact and truth-tellers do not, that interpretation would strengthen the argument by reinforcing the expectation that body language would be an effective tool to determine whether a person was lying.\n\n This answer choice may seem irrelevant. Of course people in real life do not normally speak the truth or lie 100% of the time! But if people do not adhere to the strict roles of the experiment in real life, then the results of this experiment cannot be convincingly extrapolated to real-life. In other words, the experiment was too artificial to serve as an everyday life substitute, so the author’s conclusion is weakened.\n\n(D) If anything, this answer choice would strengthen the argument, because it removes one potential variable from the experiment. If some of the participants were previously acquainted before the experiment, then some of the participants might have non-body language related clues to tell when someone was lying or telling the truth.\n\n(E) If anything, this choice would strengthen the argument, because it removes one potential variable from the experiment. For example, what if the questions touched on very personal beliefs held by participants? The emotional impact of the question itself might somehow distort a Respondent’s behavior and make body language a less useful clue to whether that Respondent was lying. This answer choice removes that possible concern and would actually increase the expectation that body language would be a reliable indicator of whether a person is lying. Since body language was not a reliable indicator in this experiment, the researchers’ conclusion would be more convincing.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |",

        "question": "A large-scale study of adults over fifty years old who spent an average of four to eleven hours a day sitting found that the mortality rates of those who spent less time sitting were consistently lower over three years - even after controlling for age, weight, general health, and exercise frequency, all of which affect mortality rates. The researchers concluded that most adults over fifty years old could lower their mortality risk over the next three years just by spending less time sitting.\n\nIn order to assess the strength of the researchers' reasoning, it would be most helpful to know whether most adults over fifty years old\n",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The conclusion of the argument is the following:\n\n\n\nThe conclusion is supported by the following:\n\n\n\nWe see that the researchers have observed a correlation between amount of time sitting and mortality rate and concluded, basically, that the first causes the second.\n\n\n\nThe correct answer will be the one such that, if most older adults over fifty years old do it, the argument is strengthened or weakened and, if most of them do not do it, the effect on the argument will be the opposite of the effect of the fact that they do it.\n\n\n\nThis choice is interesting.\n\nIf adults who spend less time sitting exercise more frequently, then maybe exercising rather than sitting less is the reason for the lower mortality rate of those who sit less. In that case, we could seem to have information that there is a possible alternative reason for the correlation between amount of sitting and mortality rate, which would weaken the argument.\n\nOn the other hand, if adults who spend less time sitting do not exercise more frequently, then we may have ruled out an alternative reason for the correlation between the amount of sitting people do and the mortality rate. In that case, we could seem to have ruled out that exercising more is the reason for the lower mortality rate of those who sit less and thus strengthened the argument.\n\nSo, it could seem that knowing whether adults over fifty years old who spend less time sitting exercise more frequently would be helpful in evaluating the argument, and thus this choice is exactly the kind of choice we'd expect to see in an Evaluate the Argument question involving a cause-effect type of conclusion.\n\nHowever, we have to be careful not to just look for familiar patterns in Critical Reasoning.\n\nAlso, we have to pay close attention to details of the passage, and in this case, the passage says the following:\n\n age, weight, general health, and , all of which affect mortality rates\n\nThis choice makes no difference either way.\n\nRegardless of whether most adults over fifty years old spend less than eleven hours a day sitting, the researchers have found that, for the ones who spend four to eleven hours a day sitting, the less they sit, the lower the mortality rate.\n\nIn other words, maybe most adults don't spend less than eleven hours sitting. Maybe most spend eleven hours sitting. In that case, the evidence provided is still a reason to believe the conclusion.\n\nEliminate.\n\n\n\nThis choice is interesting.\n\nIf adults who are in poorer general health are therefore inclined to spend more time sitting, then maybe the observed correlation between amount of time spent sitting and mortality rate doesn't mean there is a cause-effect relationship between sitting and mortality. It could instead be that poorer general health causes both sitting and mortality.\n\nSo, the fact that adults who are in poorer general health are therefore inclined to spend more time sitting could seem to weaken the case for the researcher's conclusion.\n\nOn the other hand, information that adults who are in poorer general health are not therefore inclined to spend more time sitting could seem to serve to rule out an alternative reason for the correlation between the amount of sitting people do and the mortality rate. So, that information could seem to strengthen the argument.\n\nSo, it could seem that knowing whether adults who are in poorer general health are therefore inclined to spend more time sitting would be helpful in evaluating the argument, and thus this choice is exactly the kind of choice we'd expect to see in an Evaluate the Argument question involving a cause-effect type of conclusion.\n\nHowever, we have to be careful not to just look for familiar patterns in Critical Reasoning.\n\nAlso, we have to pay close attention to details of the passage, and in this case, the passage says the following:\n\n age, weight, , and exercise frequency, all of which affect mortality rates\n\nThe argument is based on information adults who spend four to eleven hours a day sititng, but if \"most adults over fifty years old\" spend less than four hours a day sitting then maybe what the researchers found doesn't apply to \"most adults over fifty years old.\"\n\nOn other other hand, if most adults over 50 years old spend at least four hours a day sitting, then what the researchers' found does apply.\n\nThat said this choice is similar to (B), and we eliminated (B). So, why not eliminate this choice too?\n\nHere's the thing.\n\nWe've shown for sure that (A), (C), and (E) cannot work. Thus, we're down to (B) and (D). So, we need to choose between those two, and there's a key difference between them.\n\n(B) is \"spend less than eleven hours a day sitting.\" Notice that, if they do not \"spend less than eleven hours a day sitting,\" then they could still spend eleven hours a day sitting, which is within the range of the study.\n\nOn the other hand, (D) is spend at least four hours a day sitting. If they do not \"spend at least four hours a day sitting\" then they are already spending less time sitting than anyone involved in the study spent. So, they are not in the range studied. They are already beating it for sure.\n\nSo, since we have to choose one, we choose (D).\n\nKeep.\n\n\n\nThe passage say that the adults studied \"spent an average of four to eleven hours a day sitting.\" So, the conclusion is based on average amounts of time spent sitting, not on numbers of hours spent on each individual day.\n\nThus, regardless of whether the adults who participated in the study were approximately consistent in the numbers of hour they spent sitting each day, the study results still support the conclusion, since the conclusion is based on averages, which will be the same regardless of whether the study participants were approximately consistent in the numbers of hour they spent sitting each day.\n\nEliminate.\n\n D",

The information stored on our networks, such as research data, training materials, and company memos, could potentially be very valuable to competitors and foreign governments alike. In order to safeguard this information, we require that all employees adhere to strict password and data encryption policies and complete a training course detailing steps to avoid theft or loss of company-issued physical assets, such as laptops and mobile phones. Employees who fail to comply with those policies and follow the steps described in the training course are compromising the security of the company's intellectual property and will face stern consequences.\n\nIf the statements above are all true, which of the following can properly be inferred on the basis of them?\n",

Why?\n\n (such as research data, training materials, and company memos). If there was no way for competitors and foreign governments to use the company's laptops to access information stored on the company's networks, then theft or loss of those laptops would not compromise that information. In that case, requiring that employees complete the training course would NOT help the company safeguard the information stored on the its networks. Thus, it follows that \"competitors and foreign governments  be able to use the company's laptops to access information stored on its networks. (A) looks good.\n\n(B) We only know that the employees will face stern consequences if they fail to comply with the password and data encryption policies or fail to follow the steps described in the training course. We do NOT know what those consequences would be (i.e. reduction in pay or bonuses, loss of vacation time, demotion, etc.). (B) can be eliminated.\n\n(C) We know that the company's information would be valuable to foreign governments, but we don't know WHY. If at least one foreign government would use that information to somehow compete with the company, then (C) would be true. However, perhaps the governments will simply benefit from that information without competing with the company. For example, it is possible that a foreign government purchases products or services from the company and would NOT need to do so if the government had free access to the company's information. (C) can be eliminated.\n\n(D) We can't say whether employees who have not yet completed the training are  to have their assets stolen. Perhaps it is very unlikely that employees will have their assets stolen, even before completing the training. The training might simply decrease the already low probability of loss or theft. (D) can be eliminated.\n\n(E) If employees do in fact store such information on company-issued laptops and mobile phones, then the company would certainly want to avoid loss or theft of those assets. However, even if employees do not store ANY such information on those devices and simply use those devices to  sensitive information on the company's networks, the company would still want to protect those assets from loss or theft. We cannot infer choice (E) based on the information in the passage alone, so (E) must be eliminated.\n\nThis leaves choice (A) as the best option.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |",

The owner began to add a fifty-cent charge to credit card purchases under two dollars, and during the following month, virtually all customers used cash for small purchases while continuing to use credit cards for larger purchases. Nonetheless, during the month after the charge was instated, the average dollar amount of each cash transaction was almost identical to the average dollar amount of each credit card transaction. \n\nThe information in the passage most strongly supports which of the following?  \n\n",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "- Initially all customers paid with credit cards \n- 50c charge was added to credit card purchases under two dollars.\n- All customers used cash for small purchases (presumably under 2 dollars) while continuing to use credit cards for larger purchases.\n- Still, average dollar amount of each cash transaction was almost identical to the average dollar amount of each credit card transaction\n\nThis is unexpected, right? All customer used cash for &lt; $2 purchases and card for &gt; $2 purchases then you would expect that avg dollar amount of cash transactions would be small but avg dollar amount of card transactions would be high. \nwhen would the two averages be almost same? When customer pay cash for some very high value purchases to average out the small purchases. \n\nSay avg dollar amount of all purchases is $8. \nWhen the purchase amount is less than $2, customers use cash. When it is higher, they use card. But some customers would need to make cash transactions of say $15 too to average out the small transactions so that the two averages are same.\n\nCash transactions: $1, $1.5, $1.8, $14.2, $14.5, $15\nCard transactions: $8, $8, $8, $8, $8, $8, $8, $8 \n\nThe two will have the same average.\n\nA. The average dollar amount spent by customers who did not have cash available was higher after the charge was instated than it had been beforehand.\n\t\nWe don't know anything about customers who did not have cash available. Did they spend more before or later, we don't know. All we know is that before, all customers used to pay by  card (the ones who had cash and the ones who didn't) and later all customers started paying small amounts by cash. \n\nB. After the charge was instated, customers who used cash for purchases totaling two dollars or more spent more, on average, than customers who used credit cards for these purchases.\n\nCorrect. Customers who used cash for higher transactions, spent more than those who used cards. As discussed above, there must have been $15 transactions to make up for the small &lt;$2 cash transactions.\n\t\nC. The average dollar amount spent in each cash transaction at the convenience store was lower after the charge was instated than beforehand.\n\nBefore, there were no cash transactions. If there were a few, we don't know their dollar amounts.\n\nD.

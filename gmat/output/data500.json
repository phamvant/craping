I just wanted to address the way that some people were leaning towards C, so I thought I'd take on all the answer choices in one swoop.\n\na) work without interruption from other employees.\nPROBLEM: The time people come in should not have any effect on whether people get interrupted.\n\nb) consult at least once a day with employees from other companies.\nPROBLEM: Consulting with other companies once a day should be easy, as everyone will still be there for at least 6 hours of a typical work day.\n\nc) submit their work for a supervisor's eventual approval.\nPROBLEM: Notice the word \"eventual\". If this implied that the supervisor need to sign off on everybody's work THAT DAY, this might be the correct answer. But the implication here is that the supervisor could \"eventually\" approve it, which doesn't link it to any specific time.\n\nd) interact with each other throughout the entire workday\nANSWER: Contrast with C. In this case, they use the word \"entire\". Well, obviously this is going to get in the way of interaction through the \"entire\" work day. This question really does revolve around the use of the qualifiers \"eventual\" and \"Entire\".\n\ne) undertake projects that take several days to complete.\nPROBLEM: They'll still be at work 5 days a week, so this shouldn't be a problem.\n\nHope that helps!\n\n-t"

        "question": "Safety officials recommend installing carbon monoxide monitors in every home. These monitors detect the colorless, soundless, odorless gas that can be lethal to humans and pets if inhaled in sufficient quantities. Since forewarned homeowners could flee their homes in the case of carbon monoxide leaks, many of the poisonings and deaths that would otherwise occur could be avoided if homes were required to have carbon monoxide monitors.\n\nThe answer to which of the following questions would be most important in determining whether implementing the proposal would be likely to achieve the desired result?\n\nA. How often do carbon monoxide leaks occur within homes?\n\nB. Where in the home would the monitors be located?\n\nC. Do the carbon monoxide levels at which the monitors signal an alert allow enough time for residents to escape to a ventilated area?\n\nD. How soon after dangerous levels of carbon monoxide are dissipated can homeowners return to their homes?\n\nE. Can the monitors detect other household hazards such as fire?",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Ok, so safety officials recommend installing CO monitors because these monitors can detect this gas and forewarn the homeowner before any poisonings or deaths occur.\nWe need to pick a question from below to evaluate the soundness of the officials' argument\n\nA. How often do carbon monoxide leaks occur within homes?\nWe do not really care about the occurrence frequency of CO gas. We are trying to understand whether implementing this monitoring devices will prevent poisonings/deaths. Leaks may occur once a year or once a week for all we care...\n\nB. Where in the home would the monitors be located?\nWe are concerned if this device will help prevent deaths/poisonings we don't care about the location of this monitor. Sure, you may say it would be important to place it where it will be of most use but then we don't have any information whether the location affects the efficiency of the device...\n\nC. Do the carbon monoxide levels at which the monitors signal an alert allow enough time for residents to escape to a ventilated area?\nThis is crucial, because officals recommended that using this device will contribute to preventing deaths/poisonings, but now imagine if the warning signal was not given in time and you get to inhale this toxic gas sufficient enough to poison you before you can escape, this would shatter the argument because installing this device won't really save people...\n\nD. How soon after dangerous levels of carbon monoxide are dissipated can homeowners return to their homes?\nArgument is concerned about alerting people before they are harmed by the gas. We literally don't care if it takes an hour or a month to return back to homes\n\nE. Can the monitors detect other household hazards such as fire?\nWe are concerned about the CO gas not fire. Officials recommended it to prevent CO poisonings not fire or any other hazards...\n\nSo, IMO, the answer is C"

        "question": "To evaluate a plan to save money on office space expenditures by having its employees work at home, XYZ Company asked volunteers from its staff to try the assignment for six months. During this period, the productivity of these employees was as high or higher than before.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, would argue most strongly against deciding on the basis of the trial results, to implement the company's plan?\n\n(A) The employees who agreed to participate in the test of the plan were among the company's most self-motivated and independent workers.\n\n(B) The savings that would accrue from reduced office-space expenditures alone would be sufficient to justify the arrangement for the company.\n\n(C) Other companies that have achieved successful results from work-at-home plans have work forces that are substantially lower than that of XYZ.\n\n(D) The volunteers who worked at home were able to communicate with other employees as necessary for performing at work.\n\n(E) Minor changes in the way office work is organized at XYZ would yield increases in employee productivity similar to those achieved in the trial­",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Work from home led to high or higher productivity in the volunteer-employees of XYZ Company.\n\n \n\n\nNow per our understanding of the passage, let’s first write down the weaken framework:\n\nWhat new information will make us believe less in the causality?\nCause: Working from home for 6 months\nEffect: High or high than before productivity in workers who volunteered to work from home.\n \n\nGiven that\nXYZ Company wants to check out whether their plan to save money on office space expenditures works or not.\nIt asked volunteers from its staff to work from home for 6 months.\nThe productivity of these volunteers was high or higher during this period.\n \n\n\n\nThis is a classic case of improper/insufficient representation of the whole.\n\nThe conclusion is based on the performance of certain volunteer employees – representing the entire office staff.\nBut the implementation of the plan will be done on all the office staff.\n\nSo, what if what worked for these volunteers does not work for the rest of the staff?\nIn that case, the plan will fall apart or at least the plan will be less reliable.\n\nOften, causality is weakened by showing that the effect actually preceded the cause.\n\nIn this case, it would mean showing that the volunteers were already highly productive employees. This suggests that the work-from-home could not have been the cause. They would be highly productive from wherever they worked.\n\n\n\n \n\nThis suggests that these representative employees were the kind who would be productive regardless of where they work from.\nIf these volunteers were the most self-motivated, then by definition the others were less so. Therefore, whether the plan would work on them as much as it did for the volunteers is doubtful.\nIt is not exactly worded as our weakener, but it is along those lines.\nThus, this is the correct choice.\n\n \n\nThe basis of the trial was the productivity of the employees. And we have to weaken that basis. This option does not even address that basis. It justifies the cost-saving aspect of the plan.\nThus, this is not the correct choice.\n\n\n\nSince the workforce numbers aren’t equal then the comparison serves no purpose to weaken the basis of the plan. It is irrelevant.\nThus, this is not the correct choice.\n\n\n\n This supports the plan in a way since it suggests working at home presented no problem in the required employee communication.\nThus, this is not the correct option.\n\n\n\nThis Does suggest that employees do not need to be shifted from office to work-from-home, in order to improve their productivity.\nBut then the aim of the plan was not to improve the productivity of the employees but to save office space costs. Hence, this option does not weaken the basis for the trial – the employee productivity when working from home is high.\nThus, this is not the correct option.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Get 25 AI powered videos | 400 practice questions | 8 free webinars How a personalized study plan can save you 60+ hours M7 admits | INSEAD admits | ISB admits [40+ case studies]\n\nLearn why e-GMAT has 10X more 700+ verified scores than other GMATClub partners –"

The makers of Parconin argue that it is unfair to restrict access to Parconin while allowing their competition’s product to be sold without restrictions, since the two drugs have the same active ingredient and Parconin’s other ingredients are harmless.\n\nThe answer to which of the following would be most useful in evaluating the argument of the Parconin executives?\n\nA. Do the makers of Exenol endorse the recent government regulations?\nB. Do the two drugs contain the same quantity of the active ingredient per recommended dose?\nC.

        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "for the  in \n    \n\n Official Explanation:\n\nThe author doesn’t have to assume anything about “the amount of Altir present in soft drinks..” The passage has already stated as fact that “to consume a quantity of Altir sufficient to cause vision problems, a person would need to drink four liters of an Altir-containing drink every day for over 70 years.”\n\nSo, even if this choice is not true, the evidence provided still supports the conclusion.\n\n\n\nThis choice is irrelevant. The safety for human consumption of soft drinks that contain Altir does not depend on people being aware of the effects of Altir. The drinks are safe to consume or not regardless of what people are aware of.\n\n\n\nThis choice is a conclusion that follows from what the passage says about Altir. After all, if what the passage says about Altir is true, then it follows that mentioning the presence of Altir won’t result in any improvement in human health.\n\nHowever, the argument could still work even if somehow mentioning the presence of Altir would result in an improvement in health. Maybe consumption of Altir actually has benefits. In that case, mentioning the presence of Altir could help people consume more of it and get more benefits. In that case, the drinks are safe for consumption even though this choice isn’t true.\n\n\n\nThis comparison is irrelevant. Regardless of whether other coloring agents are less harmful than Altir, we already have information indicating  that Altir is not harmful unless consumed in huge quantities. We don’t need the additional information that no coloring agents are less harmful.\n\n\n\nThis choice states a necessary assumption. After all, while Altir in soft drinks may not cause vision problems, the support for the conclusion that “soft drinks that contain Altir are safe for human consumption” requires the assumption that, as this choice says, “Altir will not when consumed in quantities much smaller than needed to cause vision problems cause any other health problems in humans.”\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |"

        "explanation": "The conclusion that engineering students are lazier now than they used to be does not follow from the stated observation that fewer and fewer of Ms. Dennis’ students regularly do the work they are assigned. In fact, the conclusion is not in any way supported by the reported observation unless it is also true that failure to do the assigned work indicates laziness. That latter proposition must therefore be one of the tacit assumptions underlying the conclusion.  \n\nA is incorrect. Ms. Dennis concludes that her students are lazy on the basis of what she sees as a consequence of that laziness. This choice suggests a cause of that laziness. But Ms. Dennis does not have to make any assumptions about the causes of that laziness in order to draw her conclusion. C is also incorrect. This comparison between the work demands on engineering students and those on other students is irrelevant to the question of whether the work habits of engineering students have changed over time. The fourth answer choice is incorrect. If Ms. Dennis believed that the reason for her own students’ decreasing performance was her own declining effectiveness, she would not think of her students as exemplifying trends among engineering students in general. The last answer choice is also incorrect. Whether laziness is outgrown is irrelevant to the question of whether work habits of engineering students have changed over time.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |"

        "question": "Between 1971 and 1975, the government office that monitors drug companies issued an average of 60 citations a year for serious violations of drug-promotion laws. Between 1976 and 1980, the annual average for issuance of such citations was only 5. This decrease indicates that the government office was, on average, considerably more lax in enforcing drug-promotion laws between 1976 and 1980 than it was between 1971 and 1975.\n\nThe argument assumes which one of the following?\n\n\n(A) The decrease in the number of citations was not caused by a decrease in drug companies violations of drug-promotion laws.\n\n(B) A change in enforcement of drug-promotion laws did not apply to minor violations.\n\n(C) The enforcement of drug-promotion laws changed in response to political pressure.\n\n(D) The government office should not issue more than an average of 5 citations a year to drug companies for serious violations of drug-promotion laws.\n\n(E) Before 1971 the government office issued more than 60 citations a year to drug companies for serious violations of drug-promotion laws.",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The argument presupposes that the drug companies have not changed their behavior. That is, they committed the same number of violations from ‘71 through ‘75 as they did from ‘76 through ‘80; but were caught less often from ‘76 through ‘80 because of lax enforcement.\n\n(B) No. The argument only discusses “serious violations of drug-promotion laws.” Besides, this choice uses the argument’s conclusion (that enforcement of drug-promotion laws changed) as its assumption! \n\n(C) No. This answer-choice is an explanation not an assumption of the argument that the government was lax in enforcing drug-promotion laws. In fact, this choice goes beyond the argument and uses the argument’s conclusion as its assumption! \n\n(D) No. In fact, the argument presumes the opposite. The author concludes that the government was lax in enforcing drug-promotion laws between 1976 and 1980 because only 5 citations on average were issued each year. To conclude this, the author must assume that more than 5 violations of the laws occurred on average each year.\n\n(E) No. What happened before or after the given time period is irrelevant.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |"

To strengthen this argument, we need to identify an assumption that bridges the gap between the change in teaching practices and the expected improvement in learning experience.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) Requiring professors with PhDs to teach all introductory classes will mean that the university must hire more faculty with doctorates.\n\nThis assumption is not necessary for the argument. The argument does not depend on whether the university needs to hire more faculty; it focuses on the impact of having professors with PhDs teach introductory classes.\n(B) Students tend to participate in smaller classes more than they do in large lectures, even when the lectures are supplemented by weekly discussion sections.\n\nThis assumption does not directly support the argument. The argument is about the overall improvement in the students' learning experience, not specifically about class participation.\n(C) Major private universities already have implemented a format in which professors with PhDs teach all introductory classes as large lectures.\n\nThis assumption is irrelevant to the argument. Whether other universities have implemented similar formats does not necessarily strengthen the argument that the students' learning experience will improve at the Southern state university.\n(D) A class taught by a PhD, even in a lecture format with hundreds of students, is a better learning environment than a smaller class taught by an instructor without a PhD.\n\nThis assumption directly supports the argument by stating that having professors with PhDs teach larger classes will still result in a better learning environment. This assumption bridges the gap between the change in teaching practices and the expected improvement in learning experience.\n(E) Services that rank colleges and universities usually consider the percentage of classes taught by PhDs when computing rank.\n\nThis assumption is irrelevant to the argument. The argument is about the impact of having professors with PhDs teach introductory classes on the students' learning experience, not about how colleges and universities are ranked.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) A class taught by a PhD, even in a lecture format with hundreds of students, is a better learning environment than a smaller class taught by an instructor without a PhD."

        "question": "Advertisement: Last year, Factorial Mutual Fund continued its strong record of investment performance. Investors who included Factorial Fund in their portfolios realized an average capital gain of 15% across all of their investment assets, nearly double the market return. Therefore, investors interested in high returns should consider adding Factorial Mutual Fund to their portfolios. \n\nThe claim in the advertisement above is based on which of the following assumptions?\n\n\t\nA. Factorial Fund is one of the oldest and largest mutual funds in the investment industry.\n\t\nB. A substantial part of the 15% portfolio appreciation was attributable to the returns of Factorial Fund and this level of fund’s performance is likely to persist in the future.\n\t\nC. Last year, Factorial Fund outperformed all other funds with similar style and investment objectives.\n\t\nD. The Fund is suitable to all investors.\n\t\nE. The fees charged by Factorial Fund are among the lowest in the investment industry.",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": ", \n\nIt seems you understand that (B) is the strongest answer, but you want to know what is wrong with (D).  \n\nFirst of all, I will say: you are missing the forest for the trees.  You are getting so caught on picayune details that you are missing the big picture.  This tells me you have  experience with GMAT CR arguments and  experience with real-world arguments.  It appears you have hit a point of diminishing returns with GMAT CR questions, at which the study of them can do as much harm as good.  You really need to balance your perspective by getting an excellent grounding in real world economic arguments.  Read the WSJ, the NYT, and the  magazine.  Read about the real push-and-pull in the world.  That will give you the broader perspective you are missing right now.  \n\nIn this problem --- the broader perspective is: this guy wants to sell me this mutual fund.  His evidence --- \"\" ---- wait a moment!  Huge logical leap!  If those folks had several stocks &amp; bonds &amp; funds in their portfolio besides Factorial Fund, why on earth would we attribute the success of the portfolio overall to the presence of Factorial Fund.  If I own, say, $200 in Factorial Fund and $5000 in Apple, and the Apple goes through the roof, yes, I make a big profit, but what does that profit have to do with the little bit of Factorial Fund I had?  That is the huge gaping hole in this argument.  That is precisely the hole that needs to be addressed.   That's why (B) is the clear choice for the correct answer.  \n\nAs for (D), check your own assumptions and careful reading.   The argument does not say: \"investors interested in high returns  Factorial Mutual Fund to their portfolios.\"  (That would be way to strong for the CR section.)  Rather, it says:  Factorial Mutual Fund to their portfolios consider it, simply because it's so good, and only those investors who find it is not suitable for their portfolios should choose not to include it --- in other words, finding out it's not suitable would be the one and only one reason not to include it.  Those are all interpretations by which (D) can be false and the argument can still retain its full strength.  (D) is in no way an assumption upon which the strength of the argument depends.  \n\nDoes all this make sense?\n\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)"

One such official concluded, however, that such a prohibition would be unfortunate because it would prevent high-level government officials from earning a livelihood for three years.\n\nThe official’s conclusion logically depends on which of the following assumptions?\n\n(A) Laws should not restrict the behavior of former government officials.\n\n(B) Lobbyists are typically people who have previously been high-level government officials.\n\n(C) Low-level government officials do not often become lobbyists when they leave government service.\n\n(D) High-level government officials who leave government service are capable of earning a livelihood only as lobbyists.\n\n(E) High-level government officials who leave government service are currently permitted to act as lobbyists for only three years.",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "I think the answer is D. \n\nThe first statement proposes this idea: High level government officials can't take up jobs as lobbyists for three years after leaving the service.\n\nCounter argument: This would render them jobless.\n\nSo if you put these two statements together, what do you think the meaning conveyed is? The fact that prevention of these high level officials from taking up a lobbyist position for three years would render them jobless. \n\nWhat is the underlying tone saying? That they don't have any other livelihood source. \n\nNow look at the options:\n\nA. This is not even directly related to the statement - \nB. This is partially true and can be confusing, but by saying lobbyists were previously high level officials, it's not really saying that all high level officials were only lobbyists. They might have had other opportunities. - \nC. Talking about low level officials doesn't prove anything to us since our argument is based on what these high level officials do or don't do once they leave the government - \nD. This is the most relevant answer. It says high level officials can only become lobbyists after leaving the service. The argument in question says the new rule will render these officials jobless. It matches up. -  (But let's look at the last option just in case)\nE. This doesn't make any logical sense either. If they're only permitted to act as lobbyists for three years, what's the point of bringing the new rule? In either case, this doesn't serve to be the assumption for the argument the official proposed. - \n\nHope this helps."

        "question": "Researchers hope to find clues about the A'mk peoples who lived in the Kaumpta region about one thousand years ago but who left few obvious traces. The researchers plan to hire the few remaining shamans of the modern-day indigenous people in Kaumpta, who are believed to be descended from the A'mk, to lead them to ancestral sites that may be the remains of A'mk buildings or ceremonial spaces. The shamans were taught the location of such sites as part of their traditional training as youths, and their knowledge of traditional Kaumpta customs may help determine the nature of any sites the researchers find.\n\nWhich of the following is an assumption on which the success of the plan depends?\n\n(A) The researchers have reliable evidence that the A'mk of one thousand years ago built important ceremonial spaces.\n(B) The shamans have a reasonably accurate memory of A'mk sites they learned about as youths.\n(C) Kaumpta shamans are generally held in high esteem for their traditional knowledge.\n(D) Modern technologies available to the researchers are likely to be able to find some A'mk sites easily.\n(E) Most or all A'mk sites are likely to be found within the Kaumpta region.\n\n\nCR94231.01\nOG2020 NEW QUESTION",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "You’re right to note that the passage has no word, such as “therefore,” “thus,” or “hence,” that would indicate an obvious conclusion. In fact, the passage itself doesn’t seem to have a conclusion. Rather, it describes a plan formulated by researchers with a specific goal in mind. Let’s think about their plan:\n\n  depends, not an assumption on which a  depends.\n\nSo, the researchers have formulated the plan because they believe that it will help them learn about the A’mk people. We’re asked to identify which of the answer choices is an assumption on which “” depends. In other words, for the plan to be successful, what must be true?\n\nWith that in mind, let’s consider the answer choices:\n\nIt does not HAVE to be true that the researchers have  that the A’mk built . It’s possible that the researchers find regular A’mk buildings that give clues about the A’mk. It’s also possible that A’mk built important ceremonial spaces, but the researchers lack reliable evidence that they built those spaces. For those two reasons, (A) does not have to be true for the researchers’ plan to be successful. Eliminate (A).\n\nThe entirety of the researchers’ plan is predicated on their belief that the shamans will be able to help them find ancient A’mk sites that they learned the location of as youths. But this requires that the shamans accurately remember where those sites are. If not, the researchers plan will not be successful. So, it seems like (B) must be true for the researchers’ plan to be successful. Let’s keep (B).\n\nIt’s important to the researchers’ plan that the traditional knowledge of Kaumpta shamans is accurate. But it does not HAVE to be true that the shamans are  for that knowledge. Eliminate (C).\n\nThe researchers plan involves using Kaumpta shamans to find A’mk sites. It does not require the use of modern technologies, and it definitely does not require that modern technologies find some A’mk sites EASILY. Eliminate (D).\n\n(E) is tempting. Ideally, for the researchers plan to be  successful, it would be great if most or all A’mk sites are likely to be found in the Kaumpta region. But that does not have to be true. It’s possible that only some A’mk sites are LIKELY to be found in the Kaumpta region. The researchers’ plan could be successful while finding only some of the A’mk sites. It’s also far more important whether the researchers ACTUALLY find sites than whether they are LIKELY to find sites. Eliminate (E).\n\n(B) is the only answer choice remaining, and it is correct.\n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |"

        "question": "In virtually any industry, technological improvements increase labor productivity, which is the output of goods and services per person-hour worked. In Parland's industries, labor productivity is significantly higher than it is in Vergia's industries. Clearly, therefore, Parland's industries must, on the whole, be further advanced technologically than Vergia's are.\n\nThe argument is most vulnerable to which of the following criticisms?\n\n(A) It offers a conclusion that is no more than a paraphrase of one of the pieces of information provided in its support.\n\n(B) It presents as evidence in support of a claim information that is inconsistent with other evidence presented in support of the same claim.\n\n(C) It takes one possible cause of a condition to be the actual cause of that condition without considering any other possible causes.\n\n(D) It takes a condition to be the effect of something that happened only after the condition already existed.\n\n(E) It makes a distinction that presupposes the truth of the conclusion that is to be established.\n\n\nID - CR05667\n\n \n\n\nTechnological improvements in nearly every industry increase labor productivity, which is the output of goods and services per person-hour worked. Because labor productivity is significantly higher in Parland than Vergia, Parland's industries are, in general, more technologically advanced than Vergia's.\n\n\n Though one factor, such as technological advancements, may lead to greater labor productivity, it may not be the only such factor, or even a necessary factor, leading to great labor productivity. Therefore, the mere fact that one region's labor is more productive than another's is not sufficient to establish that the former region is more technologically advanced than the latter region is.\n\n(A) The conclusion is not merely a paraphrase of the pieces of information provided in its support. Indeed, the problem with the argument is that the conclusion goes too far beyond what the premises merit.\n\n(B) The premises of the argument are not inconsistent with one another.\n\n. This accurately describes the flaw in the argument because the reasons given in the argument for its conclusion would be good reasons only if there were no other plausible explanations for Parland's greater labor productivity.\n\n(D) The argument does not mention how long Parland has had more productive labor, or when technological improvements would have occurred.\n\n(E) Neither of the premises contains anything that presupposes the conclusion to be true.\n\n</div>­",

        "explanation": "FACT/EVIDENCE:\nCONCLUSION: \n\nWe are told that technological improvements cause increases in labor productivity --- to use the language of formal logic, we know that technological improvements are  for an increase in labor productivity.  This is quite different from saying that: technological improvements are  for an increase in labor productivity.  In other words, the argument is implicitly assuming that absolutely nothing else  ---- labor conditions, local economic conditions, difference in shipping cost for materials or sale, etc. etc. --- would affect labor productivity.  That's crazy.  All kinds of other things also could affect labor productivity.  Technological improvements are  for an increase in labor productivity.  \nParland has higher labor productivity than does Vergia.  One possible explanation  a technological superiority, but again, there are a dozen other things that might differ between the two regions and might account for the difference in labor productivity.   \nThe answer that best summarizes this flaw is (C) --- assuming that one particular cause is the only possible cause, or in other words, assuming that a sufficient cause is thereby also a necessary cause.  \n\nDoes all this make sense?

Because many of those large satellites have ceased to function, the proposal has recently been made to eliminate interference from nonfunctioning satellites by exploding them in space. This proposal, however, is ill conceived, since _______.\n\n(A) many nonfunctioning satellites remain in orbit for years\n\n(B) for satellites that have ceased to function, repairing them while they are in orbit would be prohibitively expensive\n\n(C) there are no known previous instances of satellites’ having been exploded on purpose\n\n(D) the only way to make telescope observations without any interference from debris in orbit is to use telescopes launched into extremely high orbits around the Earth\n\n(E) a greatly increased number of small particles in Earth’s orbit would result in a blanket of reflections that would make certain valuable telescope observations impossible\n\n \n\n question. Typically, Fill in the Blank questions are actually  questions, although you’ll need to read the argument fully to be certain.\n\n. The word proposal refers to the  that satellites be exploded in space. The blank in the argument is connected to the conclusion with the word , indicating that the blank will provide support for the conclusion.

In this case, the conclusion is that the proposal (exploding the satellites) is ill conceived. The right answer will support the idea that the proposal is ill conceived. That is, it will work against the proposal.\n\n. The argument does not state that the leftover debris from exploding the satellites will be removed.

Just says what you should do if you want to get rid of interference completely. Our plan is to decrease interference and this option doesn't tell us why it will not work.

If current distribution channels are no longer available, it will be much more difficult to increase circulation—so this choice strengthens the author’s claim that the plan is flawed.\n\n(D) The fact that some copies of NowNews are currently given away for free does not help to determine whether giving away all copies for free will increase circulation.\n\n(E) The conclusion of the argument is only about advertising revenue for NowNews, so the effects of a similar plan on a competitor are not relevant.</div>",
        "answer": "C",

This group could be rather small for all we know, and thus not important. 2) Even if this particular group reads both magazines anyway, it’s not clear why making the magazine free would have a serious drawback.\n\n If anything, this option might provide a factor that could help the plan succeed.

        "question": "Which of the following best completes the passage below?\n\nThe more worried investors are about losing their money, the more they will demand a high potential return on their investment; great risks must be offset by the chance of great rewards. This principle is the fundamental one in determining interest rates, and it is illustrated by the fact that __________.\n\n(A) successful investors are distinguished by an ability to make very risky investments without worrying about their money\n\n(B) lenders receive higher interest rates on unsecured loans than on loans backed by collateral\n\n(C) in times of high inflation, the interest paid to depositors by banks can actually be below the rate of inflation\n\n(D) at any one time, a commercial bank will have a single rate of interest that it will expect all of its individual borrowers to pay\n\n(E) the potential return on investment in a new company is typically lower than the potential return on investment in a well-established company­",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "I have chosen B for this question:\n\nThis question is looking for an example to match the relationship between high risk and high reward.\n\nA. The relationship between high risk and high reward is not mentioned here. Although \"very risky investments\" is mentioned, there really is no mention of high rewards. You might argue that successful investors obtain \"high rewards,\" but this is not necessarily true because successful investors could obtain many small rewards and still be successful.\n\nB. This answer choice clearly shows an example of the relationship between high risk and high rewards. If you are an individual buying a bond in a company, it would be less risky for the bond to be backed by collateral than without collateral. Therefore, the higher risk bond would yield higher interests rates and the lower risk bonds (backed by collateral) would yield lower interest rates.\n\nC. First of all, we are introducing a \"time of inflation,\" which is a bit suspicious to me. Although these questions can bring in \"outside\" information, by saying \"in times of inflation,\" we are not sure whether this is a time of high or low risk. Also, the remaining part of this answer choice does not express the relationship of high risk and high reward.\n\nD. This statement actually weakens the argument because it contradicts the main relationship. By saying that some banks have a single interest rate for all individuals, you are ignoring the fact that individuals have different risk levels.\n\nE. This also contradicts the main argument. It states that new companies (typically higher risk) have a lower potential return on investment than companies are lower risk."

Even though chickens commercially raised for meat are often fed the type of feed identified as the source of infection in cattle, Ferber's syndrome is only rarely observed in chickens. This fact, however, does not indicate that most chickens are immune to the virus that causes Ferber's syndrome, since _____________.\n\n(A) chickens and cattle are not the only kinds of farm animal that are typically fed the type of feed liable to be contaminated with the virus that causes Ferber's syndrome\n\n(B) Ferber's syndrome has been found in animals that have not been fed the type of feed liable to be contaminated with the virus that can cause the disease\n\n(C) resistance to some infectious organisms such as the virus that causes Ferber's syndrome can be acquired by exposure to a closely related infectious organism\n\n(D) chickens and cattle take more than a year to show symptoms of Ferber's syndrome, and chickens commercially raised for meat, unlike cattle, are generally brought to market during the first year of life\n\n(E) the type of feed liable to be infected with the virus that causes Ferber's syndrome generally constitutes a larger proportion of the diet of commercially raised chickens than of commercially raised cattle",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The argument states that potentially infected chicken, which are turned into feed for cattle, do not test positive for Ferber's disease. Yet, the cattle still become infected. What could account for this discrepancy? Well, if the chickens are infected but are asymptomatic (the disease does not outwardly manifest itself), then such occurrence would help explain why cows become infected by chicken feed. \n\n(D) nicely provides an explanation: Ferber's disease takes more than a year to show any outward signs in infected animals. Since most chicken that are turned into chicken feed are less than a year old, the disease never has a chance to manifest. \n\nHope that helps"

One (latter part) is a fact and the other (\"The alarming fact\") is a judgement.\n\nSharon's argument starts with a \"But\". It means she is either going to counter the judgment or the fact.\n\nIn this case, the statement of Sharon clearly does not counter the Roland's fact. It says that at a moderate level of employment, it is likely for people to know at least one person who is employed.

        "question": "The World Bank has developed a computer program that assesses the authenticity of world currency suspected of being counterfeit. The program contains extensive profiles of the printing techniques and components of currencies of all major nations; such profiles include chemical composition of paper, density of ink, and details in the printing plates that are invisible to the naked eye. Counterfeiters, including the best counterfeiters known from history, cannot hope to reproduce all facets of a particular nation’s currency.\n\nWhich of the following can be logically concluded from the passage above?\n\nA. The staff resources required to prepare currency for analysis by the program make use of the program prohibitively expensive.\n\nB. Consumer banks will soon purchase the right to use the program on their own computers.\n\nC. The program cannot fail to identify as inauthentic counterfeit currency that has previously escaped detection.\n\nD. The authentication program has taken a number of years to develop.\n\nE. In numerous cases, authentic currency is not recognized as authentic by the program.",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "C IMO because the stimulus says \"The World Bank has developed a computer program\" which means such program did not exist in the past. Furthermore it says, \"The program contains extensive profiles of the printing techniques and components of currencies of all major nations\" and \"Counterfeiters cannot hope to reproduce all facets of a particular nation’s currency.\"\n\nE also seems plausible, but to me E seems more of an inference than a conclusion supported by the entire stimulus."

        "question": "For similar cars and comparable drivers, automobile insurance for collision damage has always cost more in Greatport than in Fairmont. Police studies, however, show that cars owned by Greatport residents are, on average, slightly less likely to be involved in a collision than cars in Fairmont. Clearly, therefore, insurance companies are making a greater profit on collision damage insurance in Greatport than in Fairmont.\n\nIn evaluating the argument, it would be most useful to compare\n\n(A) the level of traffic congestion in Greatport with the level of traffic congestion in Fairmont\n(B) the cost of repairing collision damage in Greatport with the cost of repairing collision damage in Fairmont\n(C) the rates Greatport residents pay for other forms of insurance with the rates paid for similar insurance by residents of Fairmont\n(D) the condition of Greatport's roads and streets with the condition of Fairmont's roads and streets\n(E) the cost of collision-damage insurance in Greatport and Fairmont with that in other cities\n\n\n \n\n question.\n\n. The relative cost of repairing damage in the two cities directly influences profits. If repairs cost more in Greatport than Fairmont, this information would weaken the conclusion. If repairs in Greatport cost the same as or less than repairs in Fairmont, the conclusion would be strengthened.\n\n(C) The conclusion is about the profits on collision damage insurance; information about other types of insurance is not relevant.\n\n(D) The road conditions do not have a clear connection to profits. Road conditions could influence driving behavior (e.g. slower driving speeds) or accidents (e.g. greater damage) but the connection is not clear. On Evaluate questions, correct answer should directly relate to the conclusion without the need for additional information.\n\n(E) The argument focuses on a comparison between Greatport and Fairmont. Comparisons to other cities are not important to this conclusion.</div>­",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This argument assumes that the cost of insurance alone determines the profit a car insurance company stands to make. Specifically, the argument contends that an insurance company in Greatport that charges more than one in Fairmont will be more profitable, especially if drivers in Greatport are less likely than those in Fairmont to get into an accident. \n\nHowever, there could be another factor besides cost of insurance and the likelihood of a collision that determines how much profit an insurance company stands to make. (B) provides a compelling alternative explanation: if car repairs are significantly more expensive in Greatport than in Fairmont, then Greatport insurance companies will not be more profitable than those in Fairmont.

The reflected waves could then be analyzed to determine how many persons are within the viewing area of the sets. Critics fear adverse health effects of such a monitoring system, but a proponent responds, \"The average dose of radiation is less than one chest x-ray. As they watch, viewers won't feel a thing.\"\n\nWhich of the following issues would it be most important to resolve in evaluating the dispute concerning the health effects of the proposed system?\n\n(A) Whether the proposed method of monitoring viewership can distinguish between people and pets\n\n(B) Whether radar speed monitors also operate on the principle of analyzing reflected waves of electromagnetic radiation\n\n(C) Whether the proposed system has been tried out in various areas of the country or in a single area only\n\n(D) What uses are foreseen for the viewership data\n\n(E) Whether the average dose that the proponent describes is a short-term dose or a lifetime cumulative dose",

Without even looking at the answers, I could predict that one or more incorrect answers would address the measurement issue.  \n\nLet's look at the answers: \n \nRelevant to the large issue of --- would this measure things accurately? --- but not relevant to health effects.  This is incorrect.   \n\n \nAn interesting analogy, but radar detectors hit cars, which presumably blocks most of the radiation from hitting the human body of the driver/passengers, whereas these TV zapper things will be shot right at the people sitting there.   This is not particularly helpful, so it is incorrect.   \n\n \nMore data is always good, but suppose we had a literal answer to this --- \"Yes, tried in various areas\" or \"No, only in a single area\" --- if we just had that information, that answer, it wouldn't necessarily tell us anything.  This is incorrect.   \n\n \nThis touches on juicy issues of civil liberties and government monitoring of private information, all of which could play into the larger discussion of whether this system would be legal or morally correct or consistent with the US Constitution, but none of these are relevant to the health effects.  This is incorrect.   \n\n \nAh, this one is relevant to the health effects.  First of all, a single chest X-ray is a wallop of radiation ----- if folks get more than, say, two in a year, that's too much.   If each session of watching TV with this zapper system is equivalent to a single chest X-ray dose, that would be bad enough, but if each session of watching TV were a lifetime's dose of X-rays, then it would be absolutely frying the poor TV viewers.   This one is highly relevant to health effects, so this is the correct answer.   \n\nDoes all this make sense?\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)"

Not only will surgery and recovery time be reduced, but custom replacements should last longer; thereby reducing the need for further hospital stays. \n\nWhich of the following must be studied in order to evaluate the argument presented above? \n\n\n(A) The amount of time a patient spends in surgery versus the amount of time spent recovering from surgery \n\n(B) The amount by which the cost of producing custom replacements has declined with the introduction of the new technique for producing them \n\n(C) The degree to which the use of custom replacements is likely to reduce the need for repeat surgery when compared with the use of ordinary replacements \n\n(D) The degree to which custom replacements produced with the new technique are more carefully manufactured than are ordinary replacements \n\n(E) The amount by which custom replacements produced with the new technique will drop in cost as the production procedures become standardized and applicable on a larger scale",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "I'll go with C.\n\n\n\n1. The amount of time spent on surgery and recovery is irrelevant, we need to focus on costs here.\n\n\n\n2.The cost of producing these custom replacements might be down but that doesnt help us evaluate whether we will need to spend more on these replacements in the future.\n\n\n\n3. Yes- this helps , only if this new replacement minimises or eliminates further surgery only then will it justify the investment, else you need to shell out more money. If this replacement requires surgery as frequently then the ordinary treatment holds good.\n\n\n\n4. Manufacturing safety is not the issue here.\n\n\n\n5.

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "One of my clients asked me to share my thoughts on this question, so I am posting here in hopes that everyone can benefit.\n\n, which I will hereafter refer to as B, can  something in order to . How are these coupons being used or abused currently to warrant such a restriction? It is time to consult the passage.\n\nAh... now the situation should be all too clear: , which I will hereafter refer to as A, is buying these coupons from frequent-flyer customers of B airplanes, then A is turning around and selling these coupons to , apparently anybody, since these travelers can save money buying vouchers from A as opposed to buying tickets directly from B. The result: B is losing revenue. It would thus be in the best interest of B to restrict something about these free-travel coupons to reverse the trend and increase revenue instead. What do the answers have in store for us?\n\nAnalysis: We have no information on the  that a person can currently be awarded in a given year. Maybe it is already restricted, maybe not. But the issue remains that these frequent flyers are able to sell their coupons to A, without restrictions. If, say, 1,000,000 frequent flyers are awarded one coupon per year but many of them still sell their coupons to A, then A can continue to resell these coupons to other potential customers of B airlines. It is hard to see how the current cycle will be broken, especially without more numbers in hand. \n\nAnalysis: With this restriction in place, only the frequent flyers themselves--who, of course, were awarded the coupons in the first place for using B airlines--or those directly related to such people could  the coupons, thereby limiting the selling of these vouchers to A, which could then not turn around and sell the same vouchers to anybody who wanted to book a flight with B. The buck stops here, you might say. If  at large can no longer use the coupons, then they will stop purchasing them from A, assuming that A would even be buying them with the new policy in place. Thus, B stands to gain from such a restriction. \n\nAnalysis: This is a nice little distraction, one that someone who was overthinking the question might blunder into. The logic might go that in the real world, flying is more popular on weekends, so if B restricts the days that the coupons can be redeemed to , many flyers will no longer be able get a cheap seat on a desirable weekend flight. This sort of extra legwork, or bending over backwards to find a way to justify an answer, is a hallmark of an incorrect response. The GMAT™, furthermore, does not require outside knowledge of flight trends to answer its questions. \n\nAnalysis: First off, as we encountered in (A), we have no information on the current window of redemption for the coupons, so there is no basis for comparison. You might also misinterpret  as the  of times a coupon can be used, but  makes it clear that  for redeeming a coupon is what would be restricted. The problem with restricting the time in this manner is that  would be impacted equally, so frequent flyers who had been issued the coupons could still turn around, sell to A, and A could then sell to anyone at large. When the whole world is your target customer, it might not be too hard to find  within that population who would want to purchase a discount fare from A instead of a full-price ticket from B. Yes, the inventory of free-travel coupons might go down for A, but nothing about this restriction would disrupt the business model of A, and the bottom line for B could be just as grim. \n\nAnalysis: This policy change might upset the frequent flyers, but who cares? They could just continue to sell to A, who could in turn find  to buy those restricted-destination free-travel coupons. This is not a good idea for B to implement to increase its revenue. \n\nI hope the community may find this analysis useful. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. As always, good luck with your studies.\n\n- Andrew\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________"

If competitors cut prices in response, the automaker is unlikely to gain much market share from its price cuts, weakening the argument.

In the long term, the watchmaker believes that consumers initially attracted by the discounts may become loyal customers.\n\nIn assessing the plan's chances of achieving its aim, it would be most useful to know which of the following?\n\n(A) Whether the watchmaker's competitors are likely to respond by offering deep discounts of their own products\n\n(B) Whether the advertisements will be created by the watchmaker's current advertising agency\n\n(C) Whether some of the watch styles will be more deeply discounted than others\n\n(D) Whether the watchmaker will be able to cut costs sufficiently to maintain profit margins even when the discounts are in effect\n\n(E) Whether an alternative strategy might enable the watchmaker to enhance its profitability while holding a constant or diminishing share of the market\n\n\n­\n\n</div>­",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "IMO A\n\nA) This is crucial to know. If competitors also start offering discounts, the watchmaker's plan might not attract as many customers as anticipated.\n\n(B) This is less relevant. Who creates the advertisements doesn't directly impact the success of the discount strategy.\n\n(C) This might influence the level of customer attraction to the discounts, but it won't necessarily determine the success of the overall strategy.\n\n(D) This is important for the company's profitability but not directly related to increasing market share.\n\n(E) This is a broader strategic question. It could be useful but doesn't directly address the effectiveness of the discount strategy for market share growth.\n\nTherefore, the most useful piece of information would be (A) Whether the watchmaker's competitors are likely to respond by offering deep discounts of their own products. This could significantly impact the success of the watchmaker's strategy."

        "explanation": "This problem includes two great lessons about Critical Reasoning:\n\n1) With Strengthen/Weaken/Assumption questions (at Veritas Prep we consider \"which would be most useful in evaluating the conclusion\" problems as a form of Strengthen/Weaken, and in #2 I'll show you why you should typically look at these as Weakens),  is key.  You should attack wording gaps like this one: the conclusion is that the  grew rapidly but the evidence is about the .  Those are different things and you should absolutely then be fixated on trying to find an answer that could show how 1)  sales could be up but 2)  could be down.  Once you realize that the premise and conclusion are about two related-but-diffrent things, you know what the game is - that's the gap in logic, and to strengthen you fill that gap, to weaken you widen it even farther.  Probably the most common, and in my opinion the easiest to solve, logical gap in these questions is a slight wordplay difference between premise and conclusion.\n\n2) When they ask you which piece of evidence would be useful in evaluating an argument, treat it as a Weaken question.  Why?  Because we're all better at these questions when we're in \"attack mode\" and already not buying the argument they're selling us.  You should generally read the stimulus of a CR problem skeptically looking for flaws because even if it's a Strengthen problem, if you identify the gap in logic you now know the weakness you need to fill in.  With \"useful to evaluate\" problems, the answer choices neither strengthen nor weaken: they just shed more light on the issue.  But if you treat them as Weaken problems and go hunting for an answer choice that deals with your gap in logic, you can just assume that the results of the proposed fact will come back in your favor: you  to find a flaw, and if you're that invested in wanting to find that flaw the answers will pop more.  Think of a lawyer or detective looking to poke a hole in a criminal's alibi: they're skeptical of that alibi and thinking about which question will expose it.  That's what these \"useful to evaluate\" questions are, really - if you see the flaw in the argument, you'll better anticipate which question/study/fact will work in your favor to ruin the argument."

Last week, National released sales figures for the summer months of June, July, and August that showed that by the end of August only 80,000 Luxoras had been sold.  Therefore, National will probably not meet its target of selling 500,000 Luxoras in the model’s first twelve months.\n\nWhich of the following would be most useful to establish in order to evaluate the analyst’s prediction?\n\n\nA. Whether new-car sales are typically lower in the summer months than at any other time of the year\n\nB. Whether National Motors currently produces more cars than any other automaker\n\nC. Whether the Luxora is significantly more expensive than other models produced by National Motors\n\nD. Whether National Motors has introduced a new model in June in any previous year\n\nE. Whether National Motors will suffer serious financial losses if it fails to meet its sales goal for the Luxora",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The analyst's argument is based solely on the data for June-August: if 80,000 Luxoras were sold in that 3-month time period, then we would expect a total of 4x80,000 to sell in the model’s first twelve months (80,000 per quarter) -- that's only 320,000, which is far short of the 500,000 target.\n\nNotice that  doesn't have any bearing on this argument. Whether Luxoras are more expensive or less expensive doesn't change the data. In other words, regardless of where the Luxora's price falls on National's spectrum, the analyst will make the same exact argument.\n\nBut (A) points to a possible wrench in that argument. If new-car sales are typically lower in the summer months than at any other time of the year, that means that National will probably sell MORE than 80,000 in the other three quarters. And that means that total sales will likely be higher than 320,000 and will perhaps break the 500,000 level.\n\nKnowing the answer to (A) wouldn't definitively tell us whether the analysts' prediction will come true, but it would certainly help us to  the reasoning behind that prediction.\n\nI hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |"

        "question": "A certain pharmaceutical firm claims that its dietary supplement, Dietol, is highly effective in helping obese people lose weight and improve physical endurance. The company supports this claim by providing the results of a recent experiment that involved over 800 subjects suffering from obesity. During the 9-week experiment, each of the subjects was required to take a regular dose of Dietol every day immediately after their daily 2-hour workouts supervised by a professional fitness instructor. As a result of the experiment, the subjects lost an average of 12 pounds of weight per person, and over 95% of all participants demonstrated higher physical endurance. \n\nThe answer to which of the following questions would be most helpful in evaluating the conclusion of the pharmaceutical company?\n\n\nA. What was the daily dose of Dietol that the subjects were required to take?\n\nB. What was the maximum weight lost by any participant during the 9-week program?\n\nC.

What was the average age among the subjects participating in the experiment?\n\nE. Did the majority of subjects experience a significant improvement in physical strength?\n\nMain CR Qs link - <!-- m -->",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The pharmaceutical company claims that Dietol is highly effective in helping people lose weight and increase their physical endurance. However, since the regular intake of Dietol was accompanied by daily workouts under professional supervision, it is unclear whether the results of the experiment should be credited to the effects of Dietol or the rigorous fitness program in which the subjects participated. Thus, in order to evaluate the conclusion about the effectiveness of Dietol, it would be useful to separate these two effects and to see what result, if any, is attributable to Dietol alone.\n\n(A) While the answer to this question could be helpful in estimating the required doses of Dietol, the actual amount of the supplement taken by participants provides little information about its effectiveness.\n\n(B) Knowing the maximum weight loss is unlikely to be helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the supplement, as the maximum weight loss among the 800 participants is unlikely to be representative of the typical result and provides little information about the effectiveness of Dietol.\n\n This answer choice underscores the importance of separating the effects of the physical program from those resulting from Dietol in evaluating the overall result of the experiment. For example, if a group of subjects with similar characteristics would be able to achieve comparable results just by repeating the fitness program over the 9-week experiment, this outcome would cast serious doubts on the claim of the pharmaceutical company about the effectiveness of Dietol.\n\n(D) Since the company does not make a claim about Dietol’s effectiveness for a specific age group, the information about the average age is beyond the scope of this argument.\n\n(E) Note that the pharmaceutical company claims that Dietol will help obese people lose weight and improve endurance. No claim is made about the supplement’s effect on physical strength. Therefore, information about the improvement in physical strength is unrelated to the conclusion.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |"

        "explanation": ":  The department plans to apply salt to those roads whenever a winter storm \n\n: In order to reduce the environment damage caused by salt on Lakeville’s main roads\n\n: It takes far less salt to prevent icy conditions by applying salt before a winter storm, than it does to melt the ice after the storms.\n\nIn arriving at the conclusion the author assumes that almost all predictions will lead to a Winter Storm and thereby result in icy roads. Hence, to evaluate the argument one needs to know the probability of success/failure of the prediction. \n\n \n\n(A) How much road salt costs the department\n\n\n\n(B) How frequently winter storms predicted for Lakeville fail to arrive\n\n of the predicted winter storms fail to arrive, then applying road salt whenever the prediction is made will lead to more harm than the current setting does. However, if (or very FEW) winter storms predicted for Lakeville fail to arrive, then applying the road salt whenever the prediction is made makes sense. Let's keep this option\n\n(D) How often Lakeville experiences winter storms\n\n\n\n(E) What percentage of the accidents that occur as a result of icy conditions on Lakeville’s roads occur on minor roads"

We know this because Jim won with only 30% of the votes. If the number of votes was the only consideration, then Tom would have won the election. Since this is not the case, we know that there is at least one other consideration in choosing the victor. Notice that, unlike D, this is a must be true; We cannot say that the number of votes was not used, but we can say that the number of votes was not the sole criteria for determining the winner. \n\nE is the correct answer."

        "question": "Young children are advised to consume Vitamin D, a necessary ingredient for the regulation of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream, in order to strengthen their immune systems and avoid bone disorders like osteomalacia. Vitamin D is found both in fatty fish (including salmon, tuna, and mackerel) and in beef liver.\n\nWhich of the following statements can be inferred from the passage above?\n\n(A) Children who do not consume large amounts of fatty fish rich in Vitamin D run a high risk of developing bone disorders.\n(B) Seniors should consume fatty fish and beef liver to strengthen their immune systems.\n(C) Vitamin D is naturally produced by the skin when the body is exposed to sunlight.\n(D) Young children can reduce the risk of acquiring osteomalacia by consuming tuna or salmon.\n(E) It is safer to obtain Vitamin D from natural sources such as fish and beef than it is to take Vitamin D supplements.",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Though choice C states a true fact, that detail is not suggested by any of the information in the passage. Choices E and B both might be true, but nothing in the passage refers to seniors or vitamin D supplements; therefore, even though both are probable, neither can be inferred from the text. \n\nThis leaves us with answer choices A and D. If we think about them carefully, it should be clear that D is the more logical inference. Osteomalacia is a bone disorder. Children can avoid bone disorders by consuming Vitamin D. Vitamin D is found in fatty fish. Tuna and salmon are both fatty fish. By syllogism we can deduce: Young children consuming tuna and salmon ⇒ reduced risk of osteomalacia. Choice D is correct.\n\nChoice A is a tricky distractor, because it seems to be vaguely implied by the excerpt; ultimately, however, choice A is too extreme. The phrases \"large amount\" and \"high risk\" make this too strong to be a natural consequence. Also, just because Vitamin D helps prevent bone disorders, it does not follow that not consuming Vitamin D generates a \"high risk\" of getting bone disorders; other foods may be equally helpful in the reduction of bone disease, and it is plausible that a person might stop taking Vitamin D in order to increase intake of some other bone-beneficial substance."

        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "A) We cannot infer this. Although we know that fiber-optic cables are more expensive to manufacture, it is not known where the additional cost comes from. For example, it might be that the materials cost the same but the production process is more expensive. \n\nB) There is nothing in the passage that would allow us to infer this. \n\nC) While this is a tricky choice, a carreful look at the passage reveals that this is not inferrable. All we know is that copper cables need to be amplified - this does not necessairly mean that there fiber opic cables carry a larger number of signals. It could be the case that fiber optic carrries the same amount, but is able to carry it for a longer distance. \n\nD) There is no information given on the speed. \n\nE) This is correct. We know that fiber-optic cables are more expensive to manufacture than copper cables, however setting up a telephone line with copper cables costs much more than fiber optic. We also know that copper cables require amplifers, so that the signal may travel the correct distance. Therefore, it can be concluded that the excess manufacturing cost is less than the cost of amplifying the copper cables."

If you say that, you are saying that the two deficits are correlated in some way. The point is that they are not related so if one is large, the other could be small or large. A country with a large budget deficit may have a small or a large trade deficit - apparently, the trade deficit depends on factors other than budget deficit. Hence we cannot say that the country with a large budget deficit can not have a large trade deficit. \nAs for the extreme words, you cannot ignore an option just because it has an extreme word in it. Usually, \"every\", \"all\", \"never\" etc rarely work in real life and hence our conclusions will usually not have such words but an argument could be easily worded such that an extreme word appears in the correct answer. \n\nThe correct answer here would be (C)\n(C) Reducing a country’s national budget deficit will not necessarily result in a lowering of any trade deficit that country may have.\nThe argument tells us that the two deficits are not correlated so reducing one will not necessarily result in lowering of the other.

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When all purchases of consumer goods are taxed at a fixed percentage of the purchase price, poor people pay a larger proportion of their income in sales taxes than wealthy people do.\n\nThe obvious point here is why? Why should poor people pay a larger proportion? If everyone is paying say 10%, poor people are also paying 10% and so are rich. So if poor people are spending $100, they are paying $10 and if rich are spending $1000, they are paying $100. As a proportion of their income, they are paying same tax.\nUntil and unless, poor are spending more of their income on consumer goods and rich are spending less. I took an extreme example here to make sense immediately to me - say poor are spending the entire $100 they are earning on consumer goods and paying $10 tax (so 10% of their income) while rich are saving half their income and spending only half on which they pay 10% tax. So they are paying no tax on half of their income and hence as a proportion of their income, tax paid is much less than 10%.\n\n(A) Poor people constitute a larger proportion of the taxpaying population than wealthy people do.\n\nNot known. How many of the tax payers are rich and how many are poor is unknown.\n\n(B) Poor people spend a larger proportion of their income on purchases of consumer goods than wealthy people do.\n\nThis matches the logic we discussed above. Poor people must be spending a larger proportion of their income on consumer goods to end up paying a larger proportion of their income as tax. Else everyone would be paying the same 10% of their spend as tax.\n\n(C) Wealthy people pay, on average, a larger amount of sales taxes than poor people do.\n\nQuite probably true but not implied from the argument. The argument doesn't tell us that wealthy spend more on consumer goods (and hence pay higher tax). The argument does not tell us that the poor spend $100 per person on consumer goods and wealthy spend $1000 per person. It just says that poor people pay a larger proportion of their income as tax.\n\n(D) The total amount spent by all poor people on purchases of consumer goods exceeds the total amount spent by all wealthy people on consumer goods.\n\nThis depends on the number of poor, the number of rich, the avg spend of poor and the avg spend of rich. We don't know any of these figures and hence we cannot deduce this.\n\n(E) The average purchase price of consumer goods bought by wealthy people is higher than that of consumer goods bought by poor people.\n\nAgain, probably true but the argument does not imply this. It tells us nothing about the average purchase price of consumer goods.\n\nAnswer (B)­\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nYouTube Channel: karishma.anaprep"

Without knowing how many vacationers there were in each year (or at least a ratio), we can not determine which year contained a greater number of injuries.

        "question": "Most pain relievers come with warnings against continuous use longer than 7 consecutive days. While some people might be able to safely use a particular pain reliever for a longer period of time, many people will begin to experience side effects if the warnings are ignored.\n\nThe information above most strongly supports which of the following?\n\n(A) A physician should not advise any patient to take any pain reliever for a period of longer than 7 consecutive days.\n\n(B) People who are sensitive to one type of pain reliever should not attempt to use a different pain reliever.\n\n(C) At least some people who take pain relievers for longer than 7 days will experience side effects.\n\n(D) Any side effects experienced by a patient who has taken a pain reliever for fewer than 7 consecutive days cannot be the result of the pain reliever.\n\n(E) Anyone who wants to maximize their natural health and well-being should avoid pain relievers entirely.",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Solution: C\n\nThis is an Inference question. In isolation, the phrase in the question stem, “most strongly supports”, could hint at either a Strengthen question or an Inference question. However, when we take the stem in its entirety, the structure of the problem begins to unfold. Remember: premises always support conclusions. Thus, if the information in the answer choices supports the argument above, the answer choices must be premises and the conclusion is found in the argument (leading us to believe the problem is a Strengthen question.) On the other hand, if the information in the body of the question supports the answer choices below, the argument’s conclusion must be found in the answer choices (leading us to believe the problem is an Inference question.) Since the question stem indicates that the information “above” is supporting answer choices below, the answer choices must be potential conclusions. This must be an Inference question.\n\nTwo primary insights can be gleaned reading the body of the question. First, since we are looking at an Inference question, our first line of defense is the “no new information” filter. Remember that valid conclusions must always (not just sometimes) be true, and therefore must be based entirely on the information found in the premises. Conclusions containing new information not found anywhere in the argument may or may not be true. The second insight is closely linked to the first. Throughout the entire body of the question, a lot of fuzzy, non-specific words are used: “most pain relievers”, “some people”, and “many people.” They describe subgroups of the total, and are very nebulous, especially when you contrast such phrases with “all pain relievers” or “all people.” Therefore, valid conclusions that go beyond these vague categorizations may or may not be true. Believing you can conclude something about “all people” when you only know about “some people” is a logical error known as overgeneralization. Once we recognize this trick of the Testmaker, it becomes relatively easy to spot many of the wrong answer choices.\n\nAnswer choice “A” is a classic example of overgeneralization. Notice how this conclusion focuses on “any patient” taking “any pain reliever.” The body of the question only tells us about “most people” and “most pain relievers”. This conclusion goes beyond what we know, and therefore is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer choice “B” includes new information not contained in the body of the question. The evidence in the top part of the question contains nothing about people being “sensitive” to one type of pain reliever. Therefore, we cannot make a conclusion about something we don’t have information on. Answer choice “B” is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer choice “C” contains no new information, and remains within the fuzzy scope of the original statements. The body of the question tells us that “many people” who take painkillers for longer than 7 days experience side effects. The conclusion that “at least some people” will experience side effects is well within the information given. “C” is basically a restate of information already given, so we can clearly conclude it must be true. “C” is the right answer.\n\nThe conclusion in answer choice “D” also uses extreme scope limiters not justified by the original evidence. It refers to “any side effects” that “cannot” be the result of pain relievers. This goes well beyond the scope. The problem only tells us about side effects caused by a subset of pain relievers. It makes no mention of side effects not caused by pain relievers. Answer choice “D” fails the “no new information” filter. We cannot make a conclusion about something we don’t have information on. Answer choice “D” is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer choice “E” contains all sorts of new information not contained in the original evidence. The body of the question makes no mention on how to “maximize your natural health and well-being”, nor does it give us any criteria for when we should avoid pain relievers. (For example, could it be possible that the advantages of taking pain relievers could outweigh the side effects, even if we had to deal with these negative consequences?) “E” cannot be a valid conclusion."

        "question": "The short and shaggy Highland Cattle are an iconic feature of Scotland and closely connected to that nation’s history. This sturdy, resilient breed is highly familiar with the cold rainfall and bitter winds of the mountainous Scottish Highlands, and it has existed in that landscape for unknown centuries. The Highland Cattle are most common in the remote areas of the Highlands where they live and breed wild. They are known for their hardy ability to withstand the elements; in fact, many of them live upwards of eighteen to twenty years, giving birth as many as fifteen times.\n\nWhich of the following assumptions can be drawn from the information in the passage above?\n\n\n(A) Due to their stature and tough hides, the Highland Cattle cannot be used for human consumption and is good only for grazing.\n\n(B) As it is native to the Scottish Highlands, the Highland Cattle is the only breed that can survive in Scotland.\n\n(C) Having lived in the Scottish Highlands for centuries, the Highland Cattle has adapted to the climate and has developed the ability to survive there.\n\n(D) The shaggy coats of the Highland Cattle have long been used by the Highlanders for a variety of household purposes.\n\n(E) Scotland’s Highland climate severely limits the plant life that can grow and survive there, leaving the Highland Cattle with limited food to eat.",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Question presents details about the Highland Cattle, the shaggy breed of cattle iconic to the Scottish landscape. The author mentions that the Highland Cattle are strong and “resilient” and that they have lived in Scotland for an extensive period of time. The author also notes that the Highland Cattle have traditionally lived in the wild, are well-used to the harsh Highland climate and might live up to twenty years and give birth fifteen times. The question asks what inference can be drawn from the statements in the passage. Note that this question does not ask for the main point, so the student must look at each answer choice carefully to decide which is most likely to be correct.\n\n\n\nC The author states specifically, “The Highland Cattle are most common in the remote areas of the Highlands where they live and breed wild, and they are known for their hardy ability to withstand the elements.” The author also states in the previous sentence that the Highland Cattle have lived in the Scottish Highlands for “unknown centuries.” This suggests that the cattle have found a way to adapt to the harsh northern climate of Scotland during the centuries that they have lived there and have thus found a way to survive in that climate. Answer choice (C), therefore, is correct.\n\n\n\nA The author of the passage notes that the Highland Cattle have traditionally lived wild in the Scottish Highlands, but there is nothing in the passage to suggest that the cattle are not good for human consumption and can be used only for grazing. Answer choice (A), then, cannot be inferred from the passage and is thus incorrect.\n\nB Although the passage indicates that the Highland Cattle are native to Scotland and have adapted to the climate of Scotland, the passage does not necessarily suggest that this is the only breed that can survive in Scotland. The author focuses almost exclusively on the cattle in the Highland region of Scotland; other breeds might very well be able to survive in southern parts of Scotland. Answer choice (B) states details that are not supported by the information in the passage, so it can be eliminated.\n\nD The author of the passage makes no mention of the interaction between Highland Cattle and human residents of the Highlands, so answer choice (D) cannot be inferred from the information in the passage. It can be eliminated immediately.\n\nE The passage does not make claims on the availability of food for the Highland Cattle, so this answer choice cannot reasonably be inferred. (Rather, as the author notes that Highland Cattle have lived wild in the Highlands for “unknown centuries,” it stands to reason that the availability of food has been adequate for the Highland Cattle). Answer choice (E) is incorrect.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |"

        "question": "Near the city of Budapest in Hungary sits Lake Balaton, the largest lake in central Europe and one of the primary bodies of water in the landlocked country of Hungary. Lake Balaton has had a significant impact on the climate of the surrounding area: it is believed to create an environment for considerably more precipitation than in other regions of Hungary, and the climate itself resembles that of a Mediterranean region, despite the fact that Hungary lies several hundred miles from the Mediterranean Sea. What is more, the soil around Lake Balaton is dense in volcanic ash residue, which is known for containing rich nutrients, and the lake releases small amounts of secondary radiation, providing extra sunlight in the region. Wine is a popular export from the Lake Balaton area.\n\nWhich of the following may be inferred from statements made in the passage above?\n\n\n(A) The volcanic ash is the result of an extinct volcano that permanently affected temperatures near Lake Balaton.\n\n(B) Because of its Mediterranean climate, Lake Balaton is a popular tourist destination for Hungarians and non-Hungarians alike.\n\n(C) Lake Balaton has created a climate and environment that are excellent for vineyards and wine production.\n\n(D) Due to the environmental effects of Lake Balaton, the area around the lake is the greenest and most fertile in Eastern Europe.\n\n(E) Because of the climate, the region of Lake Balaton has a large number of immigrants from Mediterranean countries who bring their knowledge of wine growing.",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Question presents the student with information about Lake Balaton, a very large lake in Central Europe (the largest in that region, in fact) and a very important body of water to the nation of Hungary, which is landlocked. The author notes that Lake Balaton plays a significant role in the climate of that area, creating an almost Mediterranean quality to a region of Hungary that is hundreds of miles from the Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, the soil of the Lake Balaton area is unique with its quality of volcanic ash—which is usually very high in nutrients—and the lake itself gives off extra sunlight through secondary radiation. The author of the passage concludes by noting that the wine of the area around Lake Balaton is very popular. The question asks the student to select an answer choice that may be inferred, requiring once again that the student choose an answer based on specific statements in the passage. If the student cannot point directly to a comment in the passage as support for the inference, it must be incorrect.\n\n\n\nC The author of the passage notes several features of the region: (1) the climate is similar to that of the climate near the Mediterranean Sea, (2) the soil around the lake is rich in volcanic ash, and (3) the lake gives off secondary radiation and, thus, extra sunlight. With this, the author then makes the statement that the area is known for its wine. The immediate inference is that the lake itself has created a region that is good for wine. Answer choice (C) is correct.\n\n\n\nA The author of the passage does note that the soil around Lake Balaton contains volcanic ash. But the author makes no mention of a volcano itself, and it is assuming too much that there is/was a volcano that is now extinct. There is reason to believe that a volcano once affected the region, but there is simply not enough information to make the statement that it “permanently affected temperatures.” Answer choice (A) cannot be correct.\n\nB, E The climate of the Lake Balaton region would suggest it as a popular tourist destination, but the passage does not provide enough detail to indicate who the tourists might be. Similarly, answer choice (E) assumes far too much about the way that the climate might affect migration (if any) to the region. Neither answer choice (B) nor answer choice (E) is clearly implied, so both must be incorrect.\n\nD The area around Lake Balaton is implied to be very fertile, but the passage makes no comparison to other fertile areas in Europe. The author notes only that Lake Balaton is the largest lake in Central Europe; it might not necessarily have the greenest and most fertile region. Answer choice (D) cannot be inferred, so it is incorrect.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |"

        "question": "A large airport in a major city has proposed certain changes intended to improve the ease of flying for domestic passengers but that will also have the negative effect of creating burdens for travelers flying internationally.

The airport considered the petition carefully but has decided to proceed with the original plans, despite the fact that many of the travelers who use the airport for international travel have announced that they will begin booking their flights through a different airport.\n\nWhich of the following can be inferred from the decision made by the airport to continue with the changes?\n\n\n(A) There is no other airport nearby that can offer flights to travelers flying internationally.\n\n(B) The international travelers who plan to book their flights elsewhere will likely change their minds and continue to use the airport regardless of the changes.\n\n(C) Although the airport will likely lose certain international travelers, it will probably gain other international travelers, thus offsetting the loss.\n\n(D) The benefits from the changes for domestic travelers will bring in enough new domestic passengers to outweigh the loss of the international travelers.\n\n(E) Although the changes will negatively affect international travelers in the short term, the airport has a long-term plan to improve international travel.",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Question presents a scenario in which a large airport is planning to make changes that will benefit domestic passengers but create hassles for international passengers. The hassles are such that many international travelers who frequent the airport have signed a petition and have promised to take their business elsewhere if the airport proceeds with the proposed changes. Nevertheless, the airport has made the decision to go forward with the changes. The question asks the student to select the answer choice that can be inferred as having contributed to the airport’s decision to continue with the new plans.\n\n\n\nD The correct answer choice must indicate some kind of alternative benefit that would explain the airport’s willingness to risk the loss of international travelers. Because the proposed changes to the airport will benefit the domestic passengers (“changes that are intended to improve the ease of flying for domestic passengers”), the airport must have decided that the changes will bring in more domestic passengers who will more than offset any loss of international passengers. Therefore, answer choice (D) is most correct.\n\n\n\nA, B Although the airport might very well be counting on the reasons given in answer choices (A) and (B), nothing in the passage suggests that the airport made a decision based on those reasons. Answer choices (A) and (B) must be eliminated because they are not supported by the passage.\n\nC Although answer choice (C) is a distant possibility, the passage does not say anything about the airport anticipating new international travelers. Instead, it suggests that the airport expects benefits to domestic travelers and thus expects to draw more of them. Answer choice (C) is incorrect.\n\nE Answer choice (E) describes a plan the airport might very well use, but there is nothing in the passage to suggest it, so it cannot be inferred that the airport made its decision based on distant plans for improvements in international travel.

Extended time in space means extended time in weightlessness, which is linked to bone loss, muscle atrophy, cardiovascular problems, and other serious health issues.

        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "The correct answer here should be . The first step with any CR question is to understand what is being asked of you, which in this case is to provide an inference/conclusion that MUST be true on the basis of what premises you've been given. With such questions, the ideal strategy is therefore to .\n\n - The premises given to us make no claims about mitigating the health complications from being in space, much less that this is a guarantee. The option is worded to sound like it can be true, and it quite possibly can. However, . \n\n - We've been given no information about this, so we can't make any claims on this front. This option is tempting and a bit of a trap, since the statement \"Extended time in space means extended time in weightlessness\" suggests that there are no viable artificial gravity systems in place. However, . Anything is possible, so we can't say that this option must be true. \n\n - This is quite obviously incorrect, since we know that even travelling to a much closer satellite posed problems. It's highly unlikely that going to the moon would not cause such issues. \n\n - This option makes a claim about what  be done, and this is often a red herring on Inference CR questions. It's very hard to say for sure that no Mars missions should be scheduled because there's no way to tell what should be done based on this limited information. To use a wild example, climate change could be fast ruining life on Earth, and going to Mars may be the only way to salvage humanity. This may sound absurd, but given the premises, it is still . Hence, we cannot say that this (or anything) shouldn't (should) be done unless we literally have all the info. \n\n - Not only is this claim quite obviously right, the non-extreme nature of it guarantees that it MUST be true. It doesn't say that people will be adversely affected for sure, just that they  be. It is therefore impossible to disprove this claim, since to do so would require us to say that there is NO chance of being adversely affected, and we've been told there certainly is. This answer is therefore .\n\nSince the correct answer of an inference question MUST be true, we should always be looking to prove that it CANNOT be false.\n\n - Matoo\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________"

In Parland's industries, labor productivity is significantly higher than it is in Vergia's industries. Clearly, therefore, Parland's industries must, on the whole, be further advanced technologically than Vergia's are.\n\nThe argument is most vulnerable to which of the following criticisms?\n\n(A) It offers a conclusion that is no more than a paraphrase of one of the pieces of information provided in its support.\n\n(B) It presents as evidence in support of a claim information that is inconsistent with other evidence presented in support of the same claim.\n\n(C) It takes one possible cause of a condition to be the actual cause of that condition without considering any other possible causes.\n\n(D) It takes a condition to be the effect of something that happened only after the condition already existed.\n\n(E) It makes a distinction that presupposes the truth of the conclusion that is to be established.\n\n\nID - CR05667\n\n \n\n\nTechnological improvements in nearly every industry increase labor productivity, which is the output of goods and services per person-hour worked. Because labor productivity is significantly higher in Parland than Vergia, Parland's industries are, in general, more technologically advanced than Vergia's.\n\n\n Though one factor, such as technological advancements, may lead to greater labor productivity, it may not be the only such factor, or even a necessary factor, leading to great labor productivity. Therefore, the mere fact that one region's labor is more productive than another's is not sufficient to establish that the former region is more technologically advanced than the latter region is.\n\n(A) The conclusion is not merely a paraphrase of the pieces of information provided in its support.

This accurately describes the flaw in the argument because the reasons given in the argument for its conclusion would be good reasons only if there were no other plausible explanations for Parland's greater labor productivity.\n\n(D) The argument does not mention how long Parland has had more productive labor, or when technological improvements would have occurred.\n\n(E) Neither of the premises contains anything that presupposes the conclusion to be true.\n\n</div>­",

This is quite different from saying that: technological improvements are  for an increase in labor productivity.  In other words, the argument is implicitly assuming that absolutely nothing else  ---- labor conditions, local economic conditions, difference in shipping cost for materials or sale, etc. etc. --- would affect labor productivity.  That's crazy.  All kinds of other things also could affect labor productivity.  Technological improvements are  for an increase in labor productivity.  \nParland has higher labor productivity than does Vergia.  One possible explanation  a technological superiority, but again, there are a dozen other things that might differ between the two regions and might account for the difference in labor productivity.   \nThe answer that best summarizes this flaw is (C) --- assuming that one particular cause is the only possible cause, or in other words, assuming that a sufficient cause is thereby also a necessary cause.  \n\nDoes all this make sense?

        "question": "Local phone companies have monopolies on phone service within their areas. Cable television can be transmitted via the wires that are already in place and owned by the phone companies. Cable television companies argue that if the telephone companies were to offer cable service, these telephone companies would have an unfair advantage, because their cable transmissions could be subsidized by the profits of their monopolies on phone service.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, would ease the cable companies’ fear of unfair competition?\n\n\n(A) In order to use existing telephone wire, telephone companies would need to modernize their operations, a process so expensive it would virtually wipe out all profit from their monopoly for the foreseeable future.\n\n(B) If a phone company were to offer cable service within a particular area, it would have a monopoly within that area.\n\n(C) The cost of television service, whether provided by cable or telephone companies, scales; that is, the total cost of transmission rises only marginally as more homes are added to the network.\n\n(D) Cable programming that offers more channels is already available through satellite dish, but the initial cost of the dish is extremely high.\n\n(E) Cable television will never be able to compete with the burgeoning video rental industry, especially as more homes now have video cassette recorders than ever did before.",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Cable companies argue that telephone companies would have an unfair advantage  if  they (the telephone companies) offer cable. The unfair advantage is based on the fact that telephone companies could use the profits from their monopoly on the local market to pay for cables transmissions. \n\nWe are looking for the answer choice that most weakens this claim. \n\n(A) This answer gives a clear reason for why the cable companies' fears are unfounded. All the money that telephone companies make from their monopoly would be spent on \"moderating their operations.\" (A) goes on to say that this overhaul would completely sap the companies' financial reserves for a long time to come. \n\nBecause the telephone companies stand to lose so much money from cable transmissions they are not, as the cable companies argue, at an unfair advantage. \n\nI hope that makes sense"

This is flawed reasoning because it is possible that a student in any of the other classes could actually collect more cans compared to the student who collected the most cans in Ms. Tarnowski's class. Our task is to identify an answer option that has a similar flaw in its reasoning.\n\n\nConclusion: Mr. Kelly's students planted more tress than Mr. Jackson's students.\nPremise: Altogether, more trees were planted by the students in Mr. Kelly’s class than were planted by those in Mr. Liang’s class and Mr. Jackson’s class combined.\nThis argument is not flawed since the conclusion drawn from the premise given is valid.

So, we cannot conclude that the amount of money raised by Mr. Rowe's class is more than that raised by Ms. Hunt's class. However, the flaw in C does not mimic that in the main argument above. \n\nConclusion: The Milton student who sold the most tickets to the school fair was a student in Ms. Ramirez’s class.\nPremise: The total number of tickets to the school fair sold by the students in Ms. Ramirez’s Milton Elementary School class was greater than the number sold by Milton students from any other class.\nThis argument is flawed and this is the right answer. The flaw in the reasoning mimics that in the main argument above. It erroneously concludes that the student who sold the most tickets was from Ms. Ramirez's class from the premise that the total number of tickets sold by the students in Ms. Ramirez's class was greater than that sold by students from any other class. The fact that Ms. Ramirez's students as a whole sold the most number of tickets does not mean that a student from any of the other classes did not sell more tickets than the student in Ms. Ramirez's class who sold the most number of tickets.\n\nConclusion: The students in Ms. Ventura's class assembled more birdhouses than did the students in any other class.\nPremise: Ms. Ventura’s Milton Elementary School class assembled more birdhouses than did any of the school’s other classes.\nPremise: Ms. Ventura’s class had fewer students than any other Milton class.\nThis argument concludes that the students in Ms. Ventura's class assembled more birdhouses than did the students in any other class from the premises that Ms. Ventura's Milton Elementary School class assembled more birdhouses than did any of the school's other classes and that Ms. Ventura's class had fewer students than any other class.

        "question": "According to a prediction of the not-so-distant future published in 1940, electricity would revolutionize agriculture. Electrodes would be inserted into the soil, and the current between them would kill bugs and weeds and make crop plants stronger. \n\nWhich of the following, if true, most strongly indicates that the logic of the prediction above is flawed? \n\n\n(A) In order for farmers to avoid electric shock while working in the fields, the current could be turned off at such times without diminishing the intended effects. \n\n(B) If the proposed plan for using electricity were put into practice, farmers would save on chemicals now being added to the soil. \n\n(C) It cannot be taken for granted that the use of electricity is always beneficial. \n\n(D) Since weeds are plants, electricity would affect weeds in the same way as it would affect crop plants. \n\n(E) Because a planting machine would need to avoid coming into contact with the electrodes, new parts for planting machines would need to be designed",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "– There was a prediction that electricity would revolutionize agriculture. \n\n. – Electrodes would be used to kill bugs and weeds and make crop plants stronger. \n\n\n\nIt was predicted that electricity would revolutionize agriculture.\nHow? Electrodes would be inserted into the soil. Current will be passed between them. This current would kill bugs and weeds, making crop plants stronger.\n\n\nWhat if electricity harms the crop plants as well?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the prediction?\nThat electricity will revolutionize agriculture.\n\nWhat’s the logic?\nElectrodes would be used to kill bugs and weeds and, thereby, make crops stronger. So, fewer bad things (bugs and weeds) and a good thing (stronger crop plants). That’s how electricity will revolutionize agriculture.\n\nWe have to look for something that will indicate a flow in the logic. Essentially, something that indicates that even if electrodes are used, electricity would not revolutionize agriculture.\n\n\nElectricity will harm the crop plants too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n revolutionize agriculture. This statement highlights a flaw in the logic of the prediction.\n\n\n1. The question stem asks us to find an answer choice that ”most strongly indicates that the logic of the prediction above is flawed”. We need to find a flaw in the logic, and not find an alternate reason for why electricity might not revolutionize agriculture. If using electricity in agriculture requires additional work (option E), I might start doubting whether electricity will revolutionize agriculture (the prediction). The option does not, however, indicate a flaw in the logic of the prediction.\n\nE.g.,\n\nJohn is driving an expensive car. Therefore, John is rich.\n\nA. John lives in a very poor community.\nDoes this option highlight a flaw in the argument’s logic? No. The argument is not based on where John lives.\nDoes it weaken the argument? Yes. Now I believe less that I did before that John is rich.\n\nB. John does not own the car.\nDoes this option highlight a flaw in the logic? Yes. The argument’s logic was based on the assumptions that anyone driving an expensive car perhaps owns it. And anyone who owns an expensive car is rich. \nDoes it weaken the argument? Yes. Now I believe less that I did before that John is rich because this answer choice attacks the logic.\n\n2. One could argue that option D contradicts the passage and is therefore wrong.\n\nHere’s how:\n\nIn the last sentence there’s a prediction that the current between the inserted electrodes would \na. kills bugs and weeds\nb. and make crop plants stronger\n\nOption D states that ”electricity would affect weeds in the same way as it would affect crop plants”. So, presumably electricity would kill weeds as well as crop plants. Thus the current between the inserted electrodes \n\nSo, one could argue that “since we’re given that the current would make crop plants stronger, whereas this option indicates that the current would kill crop plants, this option is wrong.”\n\n\n\nFirstly, the question stem includes the phrase ”if true”. So, our job is not to check the validity of the answer choices. Rather, we have to accept them as true and then check whether they answer the question.\n\nSecondly, notice that the last sentence of the passage is also a prediction. Predictions always have inherent assumptions. E.g., you might be thinking “I will prepare for GMAT for at least one more hour today.”\nCan you be sure though? While hopefully nothing happens to break your rhythm, can you be 100% certain that you  prepare for at least one more hour today? No, right? You might get an important work call, you might have a family issue that needs to be dealt with immediately, you might have a friend call you and ask for urgent help, you might just feel lazy.\n\nPredictions have an inherent assumption that all things will go according to plan. And that assumption can be challenged."

The failure to make this distinction led to the making of the flawed assumption.\n\n(B) This is false: The argument tells us (indirectly) that homeowners aged 40 to 50 buy more ice cream than does any other group—which allows us to infer that they buy more than do homeowners aged 30 to 40, for example. But even if the argument had stated such information explicitly, it would not have offered any better support for its conclusion.\n\n(C) There is nothing in the argument to suggest that the information given is based on popular belief.\n\n(D) Providing precise information about the quantity of ice cream purchased by homeowners aged 40 to 50 would not improve the argument at all.\n\n(E) The subject is ice cream, not nutrition, so this point is irrelevant.\n\nThe correct answer is A.</div>",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "This Flaw question is fairly easy. .\n\n\n- Homeowners aged 40-50 are more likely to purchase ice cream and purchase in large amounts than members from any other demographic group (say 15-30, 50-70 etc.)\nConclusion:\nThe popular belief that teenagers eat more ice cream than adults must, therefore, be false.\n\nThe author makes the above conclusion based on the one data point given. We need to identify the flaw in the reasoning.\n\n In what scenario would teenagers still be the main consumers (eat more ice cream) than adults, despite the fact that homeowners aged 40-50 are the main purchasers of ice cream and not teenagers?\n\nAs you think about this, it is easily to visualize the logical gap here -  Just because 40-50 year olds are the major purchasers, it does not mean they are the biggest consumers. What if these 40-50 year olds buy so much ice cream for their teenage kids at home to consumer?\n\nThat is the situation the author has not considered. And so the flaw in the argument: \n\n\n\n\nCorrect. Exactly what we have discussed above.\n\n(B) does not supply information about homeowners in age groups other than 40 to 50\nEven if the author provided more information about other age groups, say 25-40, 10-25 etc, it does not address the core issue of the argument. For example, even if say 13-19 (teenagers) purchase information was given and it is lesser than 40-50, then the author would still make the same conclusion that teens are not the biggest consumers. And it would still be a flawed argument based on flawed logic.\n\n(C) depends on popular belief rather than on documented research findings\nThis may probably be relevant if a popular belief (which may not be supported by documented research) was used to make a particular conclusion. Then, the validity of the belief can be questioned to ask if the conclusion is valid. Not relevant here. In this argument, the conclusion (claim) is not made on the basis of a popular belief, instead the conclusion is about a popular belief. Big difference! Option C cannot be a flaw in this argument.\n\n(D) does not specify the precise amount of ice cream purchased by any demographic group\nIt is not a necessary detail for this argument to be made. The argument is purely a comparison between demographics. Exact amounts do not matter, or have any impact on teh argument\n\n(E) discusses ice cream rather than more nutritious and healthful foods\nCompletely irrelevant to the argument, cannot be the flaw.\n\nRegards,\nHarsha\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Get 25 AI powered videos | 400 practice questions | 8 free webinars How a personalized study plan can save you 60+ hours M7 admits | INSEAD admits | ISB admits [40+ case studies]\n\nLearn why e-GMAT has 10X more 700+ verified scores than other GMATClub partners –"

        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Since this is a flaw question, you know that the stimulus will be worded in the form of an argument. So, the first step is to identify the conclusion and the evidence of this argument.\n\n\n\nRonald has performed better than Derek.\n\n\n\nRonald scored 600 on the GMAT and Derek scored 338 on the GRE, and since 600 is more than 338, Ronald must have performed better.\n\nBut does this make sense? Those of you who are aware of the GRE scoring pattern would obviously know that a 338 (out of 340) on the GRE is a much better score than a 600 (out of 800) on the GMAT. However, the argument does not assume that you will know this or need you to know this.\n\nFor all you know, the GRE could be scored out of 1000 and the GMAT could be scored out of 2000. The important thing is to notice that the argument does not mention this fact, which will then take you to the assumption.\n\n\n\nThe assumption now is fairly easy to predict—the GRE and the GMAT are scored on the same scoring scale. Only if this is assumed can the argument conclude what it is concluding; if you negate this fact then the argument will fall apart.\n\nFlaw—The flaw will always question the assumption. It will raise doubts in your mind as to what if the assumption were not true. Out of the five options in the above argument, E does this best and, hence, is the correct answer. The argument does not take into account the possibility that the GRE and the GMAT may have different scoring scales—that a 338 on the GRE may actually be a better score than a 600 on the GMAT.\n\nFor clarity, let’s also take a look at the other options:\n\n(A) It really doesn’t matter how Ronald arrived at that particular score as long as there is a possibility that this score could still be worse than Derek’s score.\n\n(B) Past academic records are irrelevant because the argument is only concluding for the current tests taken by Ronald and Derek. The argument does not make a conclusion that Ronald, in general, is a better student than Derek.\n\n(C) There is nothing in the argument to suggest that the data is unverified.\n\n(D) The argument does not make any conclusions about how successful will the two candidates be in the future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |"

While this may be true, it is also possible that there are other causes. If you didn’t spot the causal argument, don’t worry. You would probably have seen it when you attacked the answer choices. Let’s do that now: \n\n\n\nThis is the best answer. The new chief executive officer may not have been the cause of the turnaround— there may have been some other cause we don’t know about. \n\n\n\n\nIt may be hasty to crown LEX with laurels after only three economic quarters, but this statement doesn’t point out a flaw in the reasoning of the passage. Eliminate it. \n\n\n\nThis answer choice may seem tempting because it’s not in favor of the new CEO. But this alone doesn’t represent a major flaw in the reasoning of the passage. Eliminate it. \n\n\n\nProfitability seems a common enough word, and a change in the balance sheet from minus 10 million to plus 22 million seems to qualify.

Studies show that the number of unemployed people who are actively looking for jobs has steadily decreased during that period.\nThe editorial’s reasoning is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it\n\n(A) presumes, without providing justification, that the government is at least partly responsible for the improvement in the employment situation\n(B) relies on data from a period that is too short to justify an inference about a general trend\n(C) fails to take into account the possibility that many unemployed workers who still desire jobs may have stopped looking for jobs\n(D) fails to take into account that the sorts of governmental efforts that reduce unemployment may not be effective in creating more high-paying jobs\n(E) ignores other economic indicators, which may not have improved during the past two years",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Over the past couple of years, “unemployment” (as measured by the number of people searching for jobs) has actually been falling. But this is largely in part because lots of people have simply given up. That doesn’t mean the unemployment situation has actually been improving. Rather, it means that our stupid “unemployment” statistic is kinda worthless.\n\nWe’re asked to find grounds for criticizing the editor’s argument, and that’s exactly where I’d start. “Dude, you cited studies about the number of people looking for work. What if people have just given up?”\n\nA) No. The editorialist doesn’t ever mention the government.\n\nB) No way. The editorialist isn’t trying to claim there is a general trend. The editorialist is only concluding that things have gotten better over the past two years, and cites data from the past two years to back that up. There’s nothing wrong with the editorialist’s argument as far as sample size is concerned.\n\nC) Yeah, this is exactly what we were looking for.\n\nD) Again, the editorialist never mentioned the government.\n\nE) The editorialist didn’t make any claim about the economy as a whole, so this can’t be the answer. The editorialist was only talking about unemployment, so the worst attack we could make on the editorialist is to say, “Your unemployment statistics are leaving out a very important consideration relevant to actual employment.” \n\nSo C is our answer."

The question asks that you match the reasoning in the answer to the one in the statement, so you are looking for a similar pattern of thinking between the two.\n\n \nThe argument tells of a maintenance man who makes an exception based on a judgment that a police officer, due to his special skills, can protect himself.\n\n\nThe correct answer will include a judgment and an exception to that judgment that matches the kind made in the argument.\n\n\nIn answer A the deliveryman makes a judgment to organize his deliveries, but he makes no exceptions, so this does not resemble your pattern of thinking and is not the correct answer. Answers B and C both fail your test because both the candidate and jury make a judgment regarding certain areas or one person to the exclusion of all others, not the other way around as your maintenance man does. In answer D the captain of the yacht judges that the US naval officer has special skills that enable him or her to handle an emergency situation, so the captain excludes the officer from the training. This resembles your required pattern of thinking and is most likely the correct answer, but you must complete your review of the answers. Answer E says the manager makes no exceptions at all, forcing everyone to participate, and this does not fit your pattern, so the correct choice is answer D.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |"

        "question": "William Paley was an eighteenth-century Christian apologist credited with developing what is now known as the watchmaker analogy. This analogy has often come under attack for a logical flaw. Paley’s argument followed this reasoning: Suppose a person found a watch lying on the ground and did not know it was a watch. Would the person assume that it simply came into being without some sort of intelligent design? Most likely not. This is because a watch contains a carefully crafted and highly complex series of mechanisms in order to make it work correctly; due to the complexity of its design, it cannot have come into being , or out of nothing, and thus it indicates intelligence and a designer. In the same way, the universe exhibits a carefully crafted and highly complex system. As with the watch, the universe cannot have come into being without intelligence and a designer.\n\nWhich of the following logical flaws best expresses the flaw in Paley’s reasoning?\n\n\n(A) A red herring, or a strategy used to create a distraction\n\n(B) A bad comparison that fails to create a clear similarity between two items\n\n(C) An , or personal attack\n\n(D) An appeal to sympathy that uses an emotional quality to make the argument\n\n(E) An appeal to authority that uses the claimed authority of an outside source",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": ", or out of nothing, and thus it indicates intelligence and a designer. In the same way, the universe exhibits a carefully crafted and highly complex system. As with the watch, the universe cannot have come into being without intelligence and a designer.\n\nWhich of the following logical flaws best expresses the flaw in Paley’s reasoning?\n\n\n(A) A red herring, or a strategy used to create a distraction\n\n(B) A bad comparison that fails to create a clear similarity between two items\n\n(C) An , or personal attack\n\n(D) An appeal to sympathy that uses an emotional quality to make the argument\n\n(E) An appeal to authority that uses the claimed authority of an outside source\n\n \n\nQuestion presents information about William Paley, a Christian apologist remembered for developing the watchmaker analogy: if a person came upon a watch and knew nothing about watches, would that person believe the watch to have simply appeared or to have no designer behind it? Paley thought not. Paley argued that a watch contains such complex mechanisms that a person would naturally assume the watch to have an intelligent designer. Similarly, the universe displays a vast complexity, and according to Paley we can assume that it has an intelligent designer as well. The passage notes that Paley’s argument is often thought to be flawed. The question asks the student to identify the flaw in the reasoning by selecting an answer choice that best expresses the nature of the logical fallacy. (The student does not need to know specific details about logical fallacies; within the answer choices there are enough details to help the student select the correct answer.)\n\n\n\nB Paley’s analogy is weak because it does not establish a clear comparison between a watch and the universe. In other words, there is not enough similarity between a watch and the universe to create a strong and effective analogy (for instance, a watch is small; the universe is vastly larger; a watch does not last very long, relatively speaking; the universe has existed for a very long time). Answer choice (B) is thus correct.\n\n\n\nA There is nothing within Paley’s analogy to suggest he is creating a distraction; rather, he is making a specific comparison between two items. Answer choice (A) is incorrect.\n\nC Nothing in the passage suggests that Paley is attacking any person on personal grounds. Answer choice (C) is clearly incorrect.\n\nD Paley uses a comparison between a watch and the universe, but at no point does his argument clearly appeal to the sympathies of others. In this particular example, an appeal to sympathy might consist of an attempt to win over supporters by appealing to religious views. As the passage does not indicate that Paley does this, answer choice (D) cannot be correct.\n\nE Paley does not at any point appeal to any specific authority. An appeal to authority involves a clear appeal to an outside source, such as religious figures or biblical claims. Paley clearly does not do this in the passage. Answer choice (E) is incorrect.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |"

Surely his economic advice is as untrustworthy as he is himself, and so the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services. \n\nWhich one of the following is a questionable argumentative strategy employed in the editorial’s argument?\n\n\n(A) rejecting a proposal on the grounds that a particular implementation of the proposal is likely to fail\n\n(B) trying to win support for a proposal by playing on people’s fears of what could happen otherwise\n\n(C) criticizing the source of a claim rather than examining the claim itself\n\n(D) taking a lack of evidence for a claim as evidence undermining the claim\n\n(E) presupposing what it sets out to establish",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "As with all \"Flaw in the Reasoning\" questions, you must closely examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this argument, the editorial concludes that the advice of the economic advisor is untrustworthy and “the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services.” What support is offered for this position? Is a discussion of taxation issued presented? Is a discussion of the cost of government service provided? Is the position of the economic advisor dissected? No. According to the editorial, the only reason for ignoring the economic advisor’s advice is that the advisor was convicted in his youth of embezzlement. This fact has no bearing on the argument made by the advisor, and focuses instead on attacking the person making the argument. This is a classic Source or ad hominem argument, and you should immediately seek an answer choice that reflects this fact. \n\nAnswer choice (A): A proposal is not rejected in the stimulus; rather, a goal is advocated by the advisor and then the author questions whether that goal can be met by examining the background of the advisor. There is no discussion of a “particular implementation” that is likely to fail. \n\nAnswer choice (B): This answer fails the Fact Test because there is no discussion of “what could happen otherwise” and no discussion of people’s fears. \n\n The answer is a perfect description of a Source argument. \n\nAnswer choice (D): This answer describes an evidence error in which a lack of evidence for a position is considered to hurt the claim. In the argument, the author improperly used evidence about the advisor, and this mistake is the error in the argument. Even though this introduced a flaw into the argument, from the author’s perspective this was an attempt to use evidence against a position to hurt the position. The editorial did not state or indicate that there was a lack of evidence when forming the conclusion. Put simply, the editor thought he had a reason that undermined the claim; no argument was made that there was a lack of evidence. \n\nAnswer choice (E): This answer describes Circular Reasoning. But, because the argument in the stimulus gives reasons for its position (albeit weak ones), the argument is not circular.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |"

        "question": "Business executive: Attempting to create an ethical company by teaching ethics to our employees is a waste of time and money because the corporate structure at its foundation is inherently neither ethical nor unethical. No matter what we do, people will inevitably act in an unethical manner. All we can do is create monitoring systems to prevent problems from occurring and to protect the company when they do.\n\nEthicist: To claim that we should not train employees in ethics because they will inevitably act unethically makes about as much sense as arguing that we should not spend money on driver’s education because all drivers will inevitably cause an accident.\n\nThe method the ethicist uses to object to the business executive’s argument is to\n\n\n(A) argue that there are problems that time and money, no matter how judiciously spent, cannot solve\n\n(B) attack the character of the business executive rather than the position the business executive is taking\n\n(C) show that the executive’s line of reasoning would lead to an unacceptable conclusion if applied to a different situation\n\n(D) show that the executive must present more evidence to substantiate the business executive’s position\n\n(E) explicate a dilemma that is central to the business executive’s argument",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Answer: C\n\n\nThis is a Describe question. The question asks you to describe the method the ethicist uses to respond to the business executive’s argument\n\n\nIn essence, the business executive argues that teaching ethics to employees is a waste of time because they will inevitably act unethically.\n\n\nFirst you notice by the tone that the ethicist indicates disagreement with the executive (“makes as much sense as … ”) and that the ethicist uses an analogous situation (“spending money on driver’s education”) and that the analogous situation has what the ethicist considers an absurd justification (“all drivers will inevitably cause an accident”), indicating that such thinking will have an equally bad result. You will look for something similar in your answer options.\n\n\nAnswer A seems closer to a description of the business executive’s thinking than the ethicist’s. Your question asks for the ethicist’s method, not the executive’s. With answer B, the ethicist makes no attack on the executive’s character, only on his argument, so this is not the correct answer. For answer C, the ethicist does use another (analogous) situation to show the executive’s reasoning is flawed and would lead to a bad result, so this answer seems like your best option, but let’s continue to review the rest of the options. Answer D does not seem right because the ethicist makes no demands for further evidence. For answer E, the ethicist does not think there is any dilemma to explicate. For the ethicist, there is no dilemma at all, as you see by his use of an analogous situation that is fairly black-and-white. The correct choice is answer C.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |"

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Method question.\n\n\nTourists want inexpensive thank paintings. \nBut they contain symbolic inaccuracies - so this art form is dying (when it loses its accuracy, it will die)\nConclusion: Prohibit sale of thangka to tourists so that artists focus on making accurate thangka paintings. \n\n\nIf tourists were forbidden to buy thangkas, young artists will stop making them (and start making other art forms that tourists can buy)\nWithout dedicated young artists, an art form will decay and die.\n\nSo how does Yvette respond to Xavier?

        "explanation": "Conclusion: Archeopteryx was probably a tree-dwelling bird.\nPremise: The curvature of the claws of the modern tree-dwelling birds enables them to perch in trees. The claws of Archeopteryx, the earliest known birdlike creature, show similar curvature that must have enabled the creature to perch on tree limbs.\n\n\nConclusion: No, the ability to perch in trees is not good evidence that Archeopteryx was a tree-dwelling bird.\nPremise: Chickens also spend time perched in trees, yet chickens are primarily ground-dwelling.\n\nThe conclusion of the Ornithologist that the Archeopteryx was probably a tree-dwelling bird is based on the premise that modern tree-dwelling birds have have curvature claws similar to those of the Archeopteryx and that since the these curvature claws enable modern tree-dwelling birds to perch in trees, the Archeopteryx was perhaps a tree-dwelling bird. What if there is another bird that has the curvature claws yet this bird is not tree dwelling although they could spend some time in trees? This would certainly weaken the argument of the Ornithologist. The paleontologist cited an example of the chicken, which is a type of bird that spends its time perched in trees, although the chicken is predominatly ground-dwellng. With this evidence, the Paleontologist concludes that the conclusion of the Ornithologist is not properly drawn. So how did the Paleontologist oppose the argument made by the Ornithologist? He cites a parallel example that is contrary to the conclusion of the Ornithologist. From the answer choices, option C states that the Paleontologist uses a parallel case to illustrate a weakness in the Ornithologist's argument. This is in line with the reasoning above, hence C is the right answer.\n\nThe Paleontologist did not question the qualifications of the Ornithologist. A is thus incorrect.\n\nThe Paleontologist did not deny the truth of the claims the Ornithologist makes in support of the hypothesis. The claim the Ornithologist made in support of the hypothesis is not what the Paleontologist has an issue with but the Paleontologist rather have an issue with the conclusion that the Ornithologist drew from the claim. By citing an example of a bird species that has the same curvature claws similar to those of the tree-dwelling birds yet this bird is ground dwelling although it is capable of dwelling in trees, the Paleonthologist calls into question the conclusion/hypthesis made by the Ornitologist. B is thus incorrect.\n\nThis is correct per the reasoning above.\n\nIncorrect since the Paleonthologist did not show that the hypothesis contradicts one of the pieces of evidence used to support it. The Paleonthologist only showed that the hypothesis of the Ornitologist is not water-tight since there not all birds with curvature claws are tree dwelling. D is incorrect.\n\nIncorrect. The evidence provided by the Paleonthologist rather opposes the conclusion drawn by the Ornitologist."

Your approach would generate a biased version of history and to avoid that, historians must stick to general and objective characterizations of the past.\n\nCarla does which one of the following in disputing Mark’s position?\n\n(A) contests Mark’s understanding of historical events.\n(B) questions Mark’s presupposition that one person can understand another’s feelings.\n(C) argues that the selection involved in carrying out Mark’s proposal would distort the result.\n(D) questions whether Mark accurately describes the kind of historical writing he deplores.\n(E) gives reason to believe that Mark’s recommendation is motivated by his professional self-interest.",

There is always more division of labor in market economies than in planned economies.\n\nIf all of the statements given are true, the which of the following must also be true?\n\n\nA. Disruptions of supply and production are more frequent in planned economies than in market economies.\n\nB. There are more specialized producers in planned economies than in market economies.\n\nC.

Division of labor functions more effectively in market economies than in planned economies.",

        "explanation": "If, as the first statement claims, greater division of labor entails a greater need for coordination and if, as the second statement claims, there is always more division of labor in market economies than in planned economies, then it must be true that the need for coordination in market economies is greater than in planned economies.\n\nThe first choice is incorrect. If the statements are true, then it is possible, and even expected, that disruptions of supply and production are NOT more frequent in planned economies than in market economies. The statements suggest that since there is always more division of labor in market economies than in planned economies, there is potentially a greater number of disruptions in market economies than in planned economies. B is not correct. One would expect there to be fewer, not more, specialized producers in planned economies than in market economies, other things being equal. This is because, according to the statements, there is always more division of labor in market economies than in planned economies and because increased division of labor entails a larger number of specialized producers. The fourth answer choice is incorrect. The statement lead to the conclusion that a manager’s task would be harder, not easier, in a market economy than in a planned economy. This is because the increased division of labor that exists in a market economy entails a larger number of specialized producers. The last answer choice, E is also incorrect. The statement that division of labor functions more effectively in market economies than in planned economies does not follow from the statements given. The statements imply that such effectiveness is dependent on the amount of coordination available, but no information concerning that amount is given.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |"

        "explanation": "In 80s and 90s, number of people visiting the Sordellian Mountains increased and many new resorts came up. \nNumber of avalanches has remained same.\nBut number of visitors caught in avalanches in these resorts decreased. \n\nWhat helps to explain this? Though more people visited and there were more resorts built, still fewer people got caught in avalanches. \n\n(A) Avalanches were most likely to happen when a large new snowfall covered an older layer of snow.\n\nIrrelevant. We know number of avalanches remained same.\n\n(B) Avalanches destroyed at least some buildings in the Sordellian Mountains in every year.\n\nIrrelevant.\n\n(C) People planning new ski slopes and other resort facilities used increasingly accurate information about which locations are likely to be in the path of avalanches.\n\nSo people used science to make resorts where avalanches do not happen. This certainly explains why even though number of resorts has gone up, number of people stuck in avalanches has decreased. \n\n(D) The average length of stay for people visiting the Sordellian Mountains increased slightly.\n\nIf length of stay increased, probability of getting stuck in avalanches increased too. Does not explain why fewer people got stuck.\n\n(E) Construction of new ski resorts often led to the clearing of wooded areas that had helped to prevent avalanches.\n\nNote the tense - the wooded areas HAD helped prevent avalanches. Now they will not prevent because they have been cleared. But this is irrelevant because we know that number of avalanches has been the same. \n\nAnswer (C)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nYouTube Channel: karishma.anaprep"

        "question": "When adults toss balls to very young children they generally try to toss them as slowly as possible to compensate for the children’s developing coordination.

This could explain why they do. The children are somehow triggered by fast moving balls, a factor that somehow helps them to quickly react and catch the balls. \n\n(B) Incorrect. This does not tell us why children would more easily catch faster moving balls. In fact, it gives us a reason to believe that they would more easily catch slower moving balls.\n\n(C) Incorrect. We have to be careful not to concoct a story from what this choice says, arriving as something like. \"This shows that children are different from adults. So, they don't catch the same way, and therefore catch faster moving balls better.\" This choice provides no information that explains why a child more easily catches a faster moving ball.\n\n(D) Incorrect. The fact that children do better when they throw faster does not explain why they more easily catch faster moving balls. While this answer is not particularly tricky, it does illustrate the fact that a choice that mentions something, in this case faster moving balls, that is related to what we are looking for is not necessarily correct, and could be a trap.\n\n(E) Incorrect. The fact that there is a limit to how fast the balls can be tossed to the children does not explain why they more easily catch faster moving balls.\n\nThe correct answer is A.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________"

        "question": "Rainwater contains hydrogen of a heavy form called deuterium. The deuterium content of wood reflects the deuterium content of rainwater available to trees during their growth. Wood from trees that grew between 16,000 and 24,000 years ago in North America contains significantly more deuterium than wood from trees growing today. But water trapped in several North American caves that formed during that same early period contains significantly less deuterium than rainwater in North America today.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most helps to reconcile the two findings?\n\n(A) There is little deuterium in the North American caves other than the deuterium in the water trapped there.\n\n(B) Exposure to water after a tree has died does not change the deuterium content of the wood.\n\n(C) Industrialization in North America over the past 100 years has altered the deuterium content of rain.\n\n(D) Trees draw on shallow groundwater from rain that falls during their growth, whereas water trapped in caves may have fallen as rainwater thousands of years before the caves formed.\n\n(E) Wood with high deuterium content is no more likely to remain preserved for long periods than is wood with a low deuterium content.\n\n\nID - CR03749\n\n \n\n\n\nThe question asks you to reconcile the two findings so this is an  question.\n\n\n\nTrees 16K-24K = more D\n\nCave water same time = less D\n\n\n\nOn Discrepancy questions, your goal is to find a piece of information that makes the findings in the argument less surprising. It often helps to restate exactly what is surprising in the argument in your own words; it is strange that the trees and water from caves of the same age have different levels of deuterium. What would resolve this discrepancy?\n\n\n\n(A) The argument is comparing deuterium from water in trees and caves. The fact that there is little deuterium in the caves aside from the water found there does not explain the different levels observed in caves and trees.\n\n(B) This answer actually makes the finding more surprising. If the deuterium content increased after trees died, this might explain the higher deuterium content in wood. But if the level does not change, then it’s still unclear why the trees and caves from the same time period have different levels of deuterium.\n\n(C) The argument compares the deuterium content in wood and cave water from several thousand years ago; anything that happened in the last 100 years is not relevant.\n\n. This answer suggests that even though the trees and caves are of the same age, the water in the trees and the water in the caves may be of different ages (cave water may be thousands of years older). If the water is from different time periods, different levels of deuterium are less surprising.\n\n(E) This information makes the findings even more puzzling. Only wood that remains preserved can be analyzed thousands of years later, so if high deuterium wood was more likely to be preserved that could explain the higher deuterium levels in wood. But if, as this answer states, wood with any level of deuterium can remain preserved, then it’s still not clear why the trees and caves from the same time period have different levels of deuterium.</div>­",

Reading and  makes it clear that this is an \"explain\" type question, which means that there is a mystery or contradiction that we are attempting to resolve. The question stem also tells us WHAT that mystery is: why did this plan did not result in what was expected?\n\nSo, we should . What's the mystery of the plan? Well, the elderly citizens of Runagia are getting substantially more pension money. But, this money isn't actually helping them! They are no better off.\n\nWhen you predict an answer to an explain question (and you should always ), sometimes a single solution will leap into your head, but other times multiple resolutions present themself. On first read through, I immediately thought of two explanations: 1) the pensions make up way too small a proportion of Runagian retirement plans to help, so the increase is useless, or 2) some expense, tax, or lifestyle change offset the extra money.\n\nWith a few well-thought, if loose, predictions, we can move to the final step: . Sure enough, (C) matches our prediction exactly, and is the correct answer. Note that our other prediction wasn't useless; it is 180 degrees the opposite of (A), letting us quickly rule out this potentially distracting trap answer!\n\nThanks for posting this question, and good luck on your studies!\n\nRegards,"

        "question": "Economist: In 2015, the average per-person amount paid for goods and services purchased by consumers in Country X was the equivalent of $17,570 in United States dollars, just 30 percent of the corresponding figure of $58,566 for Country Y. Yet in 2015, there was already a substantial middle class in Country X that had discretionary income for middle-class consumer goods such as new vehicles, computers, or major household appliances, while a significant portion of the middle class in Country Y did not have sufficient income to purchase such items.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most helps explain the discrepancy in the relationships described by the economist?\n\nA. There are many consumer goods, such as household appliances, that are produced in Country X to be sold in the Country Y market.\nB. The volume of trade between Country X and Country Y is increasing rapidly in both directions.\nC. The economy of Country Y is recovering from a downturn that affected both Country Y and Country X.\nD. Country X residents pay much less than their Country Y counterparts for housing, transportation, and child care.\nE. In Country Y as well as in Country X, there are few assembly-line jobs in factories that pay a middle-class wage.\n\n\nCR33061.01\nOG2020 NEW QUESTION",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "To me what's really important here is the precision in language as to what the two countries spend more/less on (in the first sentence): .  The seemingly-contradcitory fact is that Country X has a larger middle class to afford  (\"middle-class consumer goods such as new vehicles, computers, or major household appliances\") but note that that fact does not say anything about services and only talks about a certain subset of goods!  So while the thought is that people in Country X, where there's more of a middle class, should spend more on consumer goods, we don't have anything to say that specifically about services or the full set of goods.  \n\nFact 1: Country Y spends more on average than Country X on s\nFact 2: People in Country X have the ability to spend more on \n\nWhat's missing?  How much do they spend on services?  On goods that don't fall within \"middle-class consumer goods\"?    Choice D shows that Country Y spends more on services (transportation, childcare) and on housing (which I'm not sure counts as a good or a service, but at the very least helps demonstrate the narrowness of what Country X spends more on).\n\nImportantly: the two facts here are very related but don't talk about the same thing!  This kind of precision-in-language is huge: whenever you can note that two parts of a \"paradox\" are talking about slightly different things, the primary thing you're looking for in the answer choice is a way to explain or bridge that slight gap between those different things."

        "question": "Harunia Province has a relatively dry climate and is attracting a fast-growing population that has put increasing demands on its water supply. The two companies that supply water to the region have struggled to keep up with demand and still remain profitable. Yet now they are asking Harunian authorities to write residential water-use regulations that could reduce their revenues and restrict their future flexibility in supplying water profitably.\n\nWhich of the following would, if true, most logically help explain why the water-supply companies are asking the authorities to regulate residential water use?\n\nA. The companies are planning large water-transportation and irrigation systems that require the approval of neighboring provinces.\nB. The companies believe regulation is inevitable and that having it in place now will allow better planning and thus future profitability.\nC. Few, if any, Harunian government officials have investments in the companies or serve on their boards of directors.\nD. The companies believe that the population is not likely to continue to grow.\nE. Long-term climate projections suggest that greater rainfall will eventually increase the amount of water available.\n\n\nCR79041.01\nOG2020 NEW QUESTION",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Let us first analyze the passage. \n\nHarunia province:\n1. Dry climate\n2. Fast growing population\n\nDue to 1 and 2, the demand for water is increasing. \n2 companies supply water:\n\n1. Both have struggled to meet demand\n2. both still remain profitable\n\n\nDespite this, these companies are requesting for residential water use regulations which will:\n1. Reduce their revenues\n2. Restrict their ability in the future to make a profit supplying water\n\nThis is a paradox. Why would the two companies push for regulations, if it can impact their profitability?\n\nThought Process: \nWhat if - \n1. The companies are aware of the fact that water is a scarce resource.\n2. In the absence of some regulation on residential usage, in the future the companies would run out of water to supply.\n3. So even if profits can be made immediately, in the long term, the companies would not have enough water to supply their customers.\n4. Thus, in the long term, the companies won't be able to run their business, and may also struggle to make profits. \n5. Thus, though profitable in the short term, without regulations, the companies will either run out of business/struggle for profits. \n\nNow let us look at the options and see if any of the options fits our thought process. \n\n\n\nIt is unclear how residential usage and the entities in this option are related. There are possible use cases where this would make sense. For example, the companies wants to focus its attention  and resources on building large transportation and irrigation systems in the whole region (including neighboring provinces), as it may be more profitable (more efficient, larger systems, maybe!), at the expense of residential usage. This can explain the companies' push for regulations. But we cannot be sure as the relationship between residential usage and these other entities is not clear. Hence, not an ideal choice. \n\n\n\nExactly what we analyzed, albeit in different words. This option simply means that given the scarcity of water (probably), regulation is inevitable. It will be better to sacrifice short term profitability so that companies can plan better and attain long term profitability. \n\n\n\nIrrelevant. There is no clear connection between what this option states and the companies' push for regulation. \n\n\n\nEven if there were true, it does not explain why the companies should then push for regulations now. If the population is not going to grow, then it is even possible that demand may get stabilised and manageable in the future. Then why do the companies have to push for residential usage regulation?\n\n\n\nIf this is true, then it may be the case that the companies will have enough water to supply even in the future. Then, it makes no logical sense to push for regulations in usage now. Why go for regulations if supply will not be a problem?\n\nCheers!"

Yet despite their significant cost disadvantages, steam-powered factories were built in large numbers well before technical improvements brought their cost down. Furthermore, they were built even in regions where geographical conditions permitted the construction of wind- and water-powered factories close to major markets.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most helps to explain the proliferation of steam-powered factories during the earliest period of industrialization in Britain?\n\n(A) In many areas of Britain, there were fewer steam-powered factories than wind- or water-powered factories in the earliest period of industrialization.\n\n(B) Unlike wind- or water-powered factories, steam-powered factories were fueled with coal, which sometimes had to be transported significant distances from the mine to the site of the factory.\n\n(C) It was both difficult and expensive to convert a factory from wind power or water power to steam power.\n\n(D) In the early period of industrialization, many goods sold in towns and cities could not be mass-produced in factories.\n\n(E) In Britain, the number of sites where a wind or water-powered factory could be built was insufficient to provide for all of the demand for factory-produced goods at the time.\n\n\nID - CR01295­",

But even though in 1966 one-seventh of the cars in Morodia were replaced with new cars, the number of car collisions and collision-related injuries did not decline.\n\nWhich of the following, if true about Morodia, most helps to explain why the number of collisions and collision-related injuries in Morodia failed to decline in 1966?\n\n(A) Because of a driver-education campaign, most drivers and passengers in cars that did have safety belts used them in 1966.\n\n(B) Most of the new cars bought in 1966 were bought in the months of January and February.\n\n(C) In 1965, substantially more than one-seventh of the cars in Morodia were replaced with new cars.\n\n(D) An excessive reliance on the new safety features led many owners of new cars to drive less cautiously in 1966 than before.\n\n(E) The seat belts and power steering put into new cars sold in 1966 had to undergo strict quality-control inspections by manufacturers, whether the cars were manufactured in Morodia or not.",

        "question": "In essence, all rent-control policies involve specifying a maximum rent that a landlord may charge for a dwelling. The rationale for controlling rents is to protect tenants in situations where limited supply will cause rents to rise sharply in the face of increased demand. However, although rent control may help some tenants in the short run, it affects the rental-housing market adversely in the long run because landlords become reluctant to maintain the quality of their existing properties and even more reluctant to have additional rental-housing units built.\n\nWhich one of the following, if true, best explains the landlords’ reluctance described above?\n\n\n(A) Tenants prefer low-quality accommodations with rent control to high-quality accommodations without it.\n\n(B) Rent control makes it very difficult for landlords to achieve reasonable returns on any investments in maintenance or in new construction.\n\n(C) Rent control is a common practice even though it does nothing to alleviate shortages in rental housing.\n\n(D) Rent control is generally introduced for political reasons and it takes political action to have it lifted again.\n\n(E) Tenants prefer rent control to the alternative of receiving direct government subsidies toward rents they cannot afford.",

        "question": "The Plexis Corporation, a leading computer chip manufacturer, is currently developing a new chip, which is faster and more efﬁcient than any computer chip currently in use. The new chip will be released for sale in twelve months. Plexis’ market research has shown that initial sales of the new chip would be maximized by starting to advertise it now, but the company has decided to wait another six months before doing so.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, provides the Plexis Corporation with the best reason for postponing advertising its new chip?\n\n(A) Some computer users are reluctant to purchase new computer products when they are ﬁrst released.\n\n(B) The cost of an advertising campaign capable of maximizing initial sales of the new chip would be no greater than campaigns previously undertaken by Plexis.\n\n(C) Advertising the new chip now will signiﬁcantly decrease sales of Plexis’ current line of computer chips.\n\n(D) Plexis’ major rivals in the computer chip manufacturing business are developing a chip with capabilities that are comparable to those of Plexis’ new chip.\n\n(E) Taking full advantage of the capacities of the new chip will require substantial adjustments in other segments of the computer industry",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Dear \nWe know that the new chip will be faster &amp; more efficient than anything currently available.  It will be ready in 12 months.  \n\n\nSuppose this is 100% true.  Then we know for sure that Plexis will lose money now.  This is a clear and unambiguous reason not to advertise now.  \n\n(D) \nSuppose this is 100% true.  What do we know?  When will these other manufacturers start to advertise?  We don't know.  When will these competing product be release for sale? before or after 12 months from now?  We don't know.  If these other manufacturers found out about Plexis' new chip, what would their response be?  Would they be able to mimic what is great about the Plexis chip?  We don't know.  \nThere's a ton that we don't know about (D).  Yes, we could imagine some scenarios in which this also would be a clear reason to delay the advertising, but other readings don't support that conclusion.  This is vague and suggestive, leaving a lot of room in which we can read things--highly characteristic of GMAT CR trap answers!  This is not a tight clear unambiguous answer.  Choice (C) is a much much stronger answer.   \n\nThat was part of my analysis.   I will also say,  Plexis was able to achieve this breakthrough.  Once the Plexis chips are for sale and the R&amp;D departments of competitors can buy the chips and analyze them, then that's the point at which copy-cat efforts might begin.   \n\nStudents often vastly underestimate the importance of real world considerations in GMAT CR.

        "question": "If we are to expand the exploration of our solar system our next manned flight should be to Phobos, one of Mars's moons, rather than to Mars itself. The flight times to each are the same but the Phobos expedition would require less than half the fuel load of a Mars expedition and would, therefore, be much less costly. So, it is clear that Phobos should be our next step in space exploration.\n\nWhich one of the following, if true, would most help to explain the difference in fuel requirement?\n\n(A) More equipment would be required to explore Phobos than to explore Mars.\n(B) Smaller spaceships require less fuel than larger spaceships.\n(C) Information learned during the trip to Phobos can be used during a subsequent trip to Mars.\n(D) The shortest distance between Phobos and Mars is less than half the shortest distance between Earth and Mars.\n(E) Lift-off for the return trip from Phobos requires much less fuel than that from Mars because of Phobos weaker gravitational pull.\n\n(Aristotle, Critical Reasoning Practice Set - I, Q. 35)",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "According to the argument:\n   -&gt;    Phobos expedition is less costly -&gt; next manned flight should be to Phobos\n\nQuestion stem wants us to identify a statement, if true, would strengthen our belief that:\n\n\nLets look at the options:\n\nTalks about equipment requirement. Argument focuses on fuel requirement.\n\n\nRelates fuel requirement to size of spaceship. We do not know about the size of spaceship that is required for either of the two expeditions.\n\n\nTalks about usage of information gathered from one expedition for another expedition's purpose. Our focus is to explain the difference in the fuel requirement for the 2 expeditions.\n\n\nThough distance can be related to fuel requirement, here the option talks about distance between (i) Phobos and Mars and (ii) Earth and Mars. We still cant infer the distance between Earth &amp; Phobos and thus cant compare it with distance between Earth &amp; Mars. \n\n\nCorrect answer. Explains that: fuel consumption during lift off from Phobos &lt; fuel consumption during lift off from Mars. Therefore it increase our belief that fuel requirement might be lesser in case of Phobos expedition"

Grocers stopped selling apples. So even though people wanted to buy, they couldn't. Hence the sales fell. This explains our paradox.\n\n(B) Because of a growing number of food-safety warnings, consumers in March were indifferent to such warnings.\n\nThis tells us why people ignored the negative report. That doesn't help us figure out why sales fell despite consumers interest remaining same. \n\n(C) The report was delivered on television and also appeared in newspapers.\n\nIrrelevant.\n\n(D) The report did not mention that any other fruit contains Alar, although the preservative is used on other fruit.\n\nIrrelevant\n\n(E) Public health officials did not believe that apples posed a health threat because only minute traces of Alar were present in affected apples.\n\nAgain, doesn't explain why sales fell. \n\nAnswer (A)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nYouTube Channel: karishma.anaprep"

        "question": "Many people start working out in a gym in order to become fitter. When surveyed a month after joining the gym, a large majority of these people report a high level of satisfaction with having joined a gym although the typical gym member gains, on average, 3 pounds in the first month after joining the gym.\n\nWhich of the following resolves the seeming discrepancy described above?\n\n\nA. Not all people surveyed were satisfied with their gyms.\n\nB. Working out in a gym increases muscle tissue and decreases fat tissue, which improves one's fitness.\n\nC. People that are new to working out in a gym are not more prone to physical injury than those that are experienced members.\n\nD. A similar survey conducted among gym members two months after they had joined a gym had very similar results.\n\nE. The only reason for satisfaction with a gym is the amount of weight lost after joining it.",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "To resolve the discrepancy presented in the scenario, which is that many people gain an average of 3 pounds in the first month after joining a gym, yet they report high levels of satisfaction, we need to find an answer choice that makes it reasonable for people to be satisfied despite the weight gain. Let's analyze the options:\n\nA. \"Not all people surveyed were satisfied with their gyms.\"\n\nThis option doesn't resolve the discrepancy; it merely suggests that some people might not be satisfied, which is expected in any survey.\nB. \"Working out in a gym increases muscle tissue and decreases fat tissue, which improves one's fitness.\"\n\nThis option provides a reasonable explanation for the discrepancy. Even though gym members may gain weight due to increased muscle mass, they are becoming fitter, which aligns with their goal of joining the gym.\nC. \"People that are new to working out in a gym are not more prone to physical injury than those that are experienced members.\"\n\nThis information is not directly relevant to explaining why people are satisfied despite weight gain.\nD. \"A similar survey conducted among gym members two months after they had joined a gym had very similar results.\"\n\nThis option suggests that the pattern continues over time, but it doesn't explain why people are satisfied despite the weight gain.\nE. \"The only reason for satisfaction with a gym is the amount of weight lost after joining it.\"\n\nThis option is too extreme and doesn't take into account the possibility that people join gyms for various reasons, not just weight loss.\nThe most appropriate answer is Option B because it provides a reasonable explanation for why people might be satisfied despite gaining weight in the initial month after joining a gym. It acknowledges that the weight gain could be due to muscle development, which contributes to improved fitness."

Children who attend daycare nurseries during preschool are exposed to common childhood illnesses, which helps them develop immunity, making them less prone to these illnesses when they reach school age. This aligns with the information presented in the passage."

Parallel reasoning questions, while relatively rare, tend to trip test takers up.\n\nWhen asked a parallel reasoning question, I like to translate the stimulus into variables.  Because the subject matter will be different for the answer choices, translating everything to variables helps me not get lost in the unrelated subject matter.\n\nQuestion stimulus:\nConversation - X\nTelevision - Y\nFrayed family ties - Z\nY eliminates X, which causes Z.  Z is undesirable; the only solution is to eliminate Y.\n\nAnswer choice C:\nEngaging in sports - X\nWatching Sports - Y\nHealth deteriorates - Z\nY eliminates X, which causes Z.  Z is undesirable; the only solution is to eliminate Y.\n\nNo other answer choices matches.  This kind of logic takes a while to get used to, but is very helpful once you develop the habit.\n\nI hope this helps!!!"

But they are fair game, and understanding the logical underpinnings is a skill to develop for any type of CR question.\n\nThe passage could not be more straightforward. The argument runs that  should not , since these same types of errors . If you prefer the premise to come first, we get something like , in which X and Y are held together by a common theme—in this case, errors. We want to find an answer choice that mimics this sort of relationship.\n\n of our company: you  our president’s name. and promotion decisions. \nThis looks pretty good. Note that similar  does not have to mean similar . The passage deals with errors, the answer choice with hiring practices, but the reasoning is similar, fitting into the same  shell I mentioned above.\n\n: selling it is  under an existing-product clause. would be likely to produce any kind of product. \n\n from a soft-drink company.  has to do with accepting , I have no clue. If the coach was not supposed to accept money from sponsors, then the deal could be seen as unethical, but even then, there is no reasonable association with swimming. \n\n: your revenue depends on  and  prove difficult to comprehend, this answer choice could look feasible. But the argument makes no sense, unless we want to assume that  in question would not want to read about . I would think high schoolers would be more interested in reading about issues that would potentially affect them. In any case, despite the fact that there is a common thread here in high school, the relationship between the two halves of the argument is unclear, not like what we see in the passage. Again, the argument in the passage is essentially,  It is hard to create a parallel sentence with the information in the answer choice above.\n\nIn the end, (B) stands alone as the one reasonable answer. A harder question might place the premise and argument in a different order or present more answer choices with paired elements X and Y, but with different relationships between them. But you have to take what you can get, especially when looking at LSAT Logical Reasoning questions. Count yourself lucky here.\n\n- Andrew\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________"

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Answer: D\n\n\n\nThis is a Parallel question. It asks that you find among the answers a situation that “parallels” the one given.\n\n\nThe given situation is that of an auction that Jody is not participating in; because nobody wants to buy the Giacometti statue more than she does, then “not one person” will bid on the statue no matter how low the bidding starts. \n\n\nMost likely the correct answer will use similar extreme or all-or-nothing terms like “most,” “nobody,” or “not one person” and will create an equally absurd notion. The correct answer will have a similar flawed logic. \n\n\nAnswer A starts out well, saying that one jockey wants something the “most,” but it breaks down later in the statement because it says the other jockeys will just double their efforts. This is not the all-or-nothing statement you need. Answer B starts off with Larry being the most qualified to spot a forgery, but the rest of the statement is wrong because it says that since one item has no flaws, others must be forgeries. This is not an all-or-nothing result of the first statement. Answer C does not say Professor Ricardo is the only one who can translate the text. It leaves open the possibility that there are others, definitely not an all-or-nothing result. In answer D, Emilio is the “most” intent to get the sales position, and because he is not applying, nobody else will apply no matter how high the salary goes. You have your extreme (“most”) and all-or-nothing result (“nobody else”) words and the statement is equally flawed in logic. This would seem to be your answer, but you must read your last option. In answer E, Sherry is not the most motivated to join the group, and her timing conflicts result in only a gradually worsening situation, not an all-or-nothing situation.

        "question": "Factory workers in Beltania are guaranteed lifetime jobs, bonuses paid on the basis of productivity and corporate profits, and a wage rate that is not attached to a particular job.\nParadoxically, these guarantees do not discourage factory owners from introducing labor-saving machinery. Such innovations are to the factory owners’ advantage despite the fact that the owners must protect the wages of their workers.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most helps to explain why the introduction of labor-saving machinery is advantageous to factory owners?\n\n\nA. Before a Beltanian Factory worker is hired, he or she must present a record of his or her previous productivity.\n\nB. Labor-saving machinery increases productivity, thus yielding profits that more than cover the cost of retraining workers for other jobs.\n\nC. The purchase and maintenance of new machinery adds significantly to the final cost of the goods produced.\n\nD. Factory workers demand a change of procedure in the routine tasks they perform.\n\nE. Limited competition exists among Beltanian factories for consumer markets.",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If the second answer choice is true, introducing labor-saving machinery results in additional profits even if it also requires the retraining of workers. Hence, this answer choice demonstrates the advantages to the factory owners of labor-saving machinery.  \n\nThe first answer choice is incorrect. Productivity in a previous job may relate to productivity in the job for which a worker is hired. However, if the worker’s job is eliminated by new machinery, the factory owner loses the advantage of having been able to select a highly productive worker for that job. There is no indication in this answer choice of what advantage, if any, the owner gains. C is incorrect. Since increased costs, other things being equal, mean decreased profits, this answer choice suggests the change is disadvantageous to the factory owners. D is also incorrect. Changes of procedure may result for those employees whose jobs are eliminated by the introduction of machinery, but would not necessarily result for a substantial number of factory workers. The owners have an advantage only if a substantial number of workers have been satisfied. Thus, this fourth answer choice cannot explain why the change is advantageous. The last answer choice is incorrect. Limited competition might imply that the factory owners will be able to sell their products, even if the price must be raised to cover new machinery as well as wages. Although this does not harm the factory owners, it does not suggest an advantage either.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |"

        "explanation": "Plan: Increase profit by adding oatmeal\n\nOatmeal is popular among workers\nOatmeal is “the ultimate convenience food” because it can be served by the cup\nOatmeal does not require elaborate cooking equipment so no large investment needed\n\nHence, it seems likely that \"profit\" will increase because investment is less while it is popular. We need to make our plan more likely to be successful:\n\nA. Some of the office building's businesses have recently begun providing free coffee to their employees.\n\nThis is bad news for coffee stand business. If businesses provide free coffee, fewer people will visit the stand.\n\nB. The ingredients needed to make oatmeal are inexpensive and do not spoil easily the way many fresh breakfast foods typically sold at coffee stands do.\n\nSo costs are low and wastage may be low too. This does show that our profits may increase. It is good for our plan. Hence this is the answer.\n\nC. In order to offer more flexible schedules to their workers, several businesses in the office building will soon be expanding their hours.\n\nFlexible schedule means that some people might come in early morning and leave early evening while other may come in afternoon and leave at night etc. So people will be spread out over more hrs, say 18 hrs. Is this good news for our stand, we don't know. Fewer people may come in during breakfast time and if we serve oatmeal only during breakfast, we may not get enough business. On the other hand, more people may come earlier than usual and hence may want breakfast in office so we may get a lot of business. On the whole, how this will impact our coffee stand depends on how the plan is implemented and how people react to expanded hours. \n\nD. Supermarket sales of oatmeal and other cereals slowed this year following large gains last year.\n\nDoesn't impact us.\n\nE. Oatmeal manufacturers have recently reduced their oatmeal offerings, which had included oatmeal in microwaveable cups and convenient cereal bars made with rolled oats.\n\nDid many people use microwaveable cups and convenient cereal bars made with rolled oats?

        "question": "for GMAT Review, 12th Edition, 2009\n\nThe Eurasian ruffe, a fish species inadvertently introduced into North America’s Great Lakes in recent years, feeds on the eggs of lake whitefish, a native species, thus threatening the lakes’ natural ecosystem. To help track the ruffe’s spread, government agencies have produced wallet-sized cards about the ruffe. The cards contain pictures of the ruffe and explain the danger they pose; the cards also request anglers to report any ruffe they catch.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, would provide most support for the prediction that the agencies’ action will have its intended effect?\n\n(A) The ruffe has spiny fins that make it unattractive as prey.\n\n(B) Ruffe generally feed at night, but most recreational fishing on the Great Lakes is done during daytime hours.\n\n(C) Most people who fish recreationally on the Great Lakes are interested in the preservation of the lake whitefish because it is a highly prized game fish.\n\n(D) The ruffe is one of several nonnative species in the Great Lakes whose existence threatens the survival of lake whitefish populations there.\n\n(E) The bait that most people use when fishing for whitefish on the Great Lakes is not attractive to ruffe.",

        "question": "for GMAT Verbal Review, 2nd Edition\n\n\nQuestion No.: 21\nPage: 123Aphasia, an impairment of the capacity to use language, often occurs when a stroke damages the left half of the brain. Many people with stroke-related aphasia recover at least some capacity to use language within a year. One proposed explanation for such recoveries is that the right side of the brain, which is not usually the major language center, develops its latent language capabilities to compensate for the damage to the left side.\n\n\n\n(A) In a study of local brain activity in people performing a language task, people with stroke related aphasia showed higher activity levels in the right half of the brain than people who did not have aphasia.\n\n(B) A blow to the head injuring the left half of the brain can result in impairment of the capacity to use language indistinguishable from that produced by a stroke.\n\n(C) Among people with stroke-related aphasia, recovering lost capacity to use language does not lead to any impairment of those capacities normally controlled by the right half of the brain.\n\n(D) A stroke that damages the left half of the brain often causes physical impairments of the right side of the body that lessen over time.\n\n(E) Studies of numerous people with aphasia have indicated that the functions that govern language production and those that govern language comprehension are located in separate areas of the brain.",
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "gave while rejecting option (C).\n\n(C). This provides no evidence about whether it is the right half of the brain’s developing its latent\nlanguage capabilities that alleviates aphasia.

Since drivers of noncommercial vehicles also use radar detectors and since speeding decreases safety for any vehicle, use of radar detectors should also be banned in noncommercial vehicles to increase safety.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most strongly supports the argument above?\n\n\nA. The average noncommercial-vehicle driver is involved in less long-distance driving than is the average commercial-vehicle driver.\n\nB. In many places airplanes or helicopters are used rather than radar to locate vehicles traveling faster than the posted speed limit.\n\nC.

        "question": "Two decades after the Emerald River Dam was built, none of the eight fish species native to the Emerald River was still reproducing adequately in the river below the dam. Since the dam reduced the annual range of water temperature in the river below the dam from 50 degrees to 6 degrees, scientists have hypothesized that sharply rising water temperatures must be involved in signaling the native species to begin the reproductive cycle.\n\nWhich of the following statements, if true, would most strengthen the scientists’ hypothesis?\n\n(A) The native fish species were still able to reproduce only in side streams of the river below the dam where the annual temperature range remains approximately 50 degrees.\n\n(B) Before the dam was built, the Emerald River annually overflowed its banks, creating backwaters that were critical breeding areas for the native species of fish.\n\n(C) The lowest recorded temperature of the Emerald River before the dam was built was 34 degrees, whereas the lowest recorded temperature of the river after the dam was built has been 43 degrees.\n\n(D) Nonnative species of fish, introduced into the Emerald River after the dam was built, have begun competing with the declining native fish species for food and space.\n\n(E) Five of the fish species native to the Emerald River are not native to any other river in North America.",

        "explanation": "Evaluation of a Plan\nSituation A company plans to increase the total efficiency of its farms in an arid region by drilling down to an aquifer whose water will be used to raise fish in ponds and to help irrigate the farms' vegetable fields. The ponds and accompanying vegetation should help reduce\nthe heat around the farms.\n\nReasoning What would make it most likely that implementing the plan would increase the farms' overall efficiency? The farms will become more efficient if the plan significantly increases\ntheir production for little or no added cost.\n\nA Vegetation native to an arid region may be no more likely to thrive around ponds than non-native vegetation would be, and in any case would not clearly increase the farms' total crop production or efficiency.\n\nB This makes it slightly more likely that the plan would increase the farms' profitability, not their efficiency or productivity.\n\nC Correct. Fertilizing the fields with the waste while irrigating the crops might significantly improve crop production. But it would cost little or nothing extra, since the waste would already be in the irrigation water. Thus, this feature of the plan would likely enhance the farms' efficiency by increasing their productivity for no significant extra cost.\n\nD This government assistance might slightly reduce the work the company has to do to procure a loan. But probably it would neither increase the farms' production nor reduce the overall expense of implementing the plan (including the expense incurred by the government).\n\nE If anything, this suggests that the plan might reduce the farms' efficiency by eliminating productive crop land.\n\n\nThe correct answer is C."

The company is also less likely to have to manage a scenario in which the employee cannot work because they suffer from heart disease. This program clearly provides benefits to both the employee and the company.\n\n(C) is looking good for now.

This is the Alternative approach.\n\nA. This policy would promote additional consumption, which is what we need. Looks good, let's look at the others.\nB. How does this affect water consumption?\nC. This policy would cause reduced consumption, the opposite of what we need.\nD. This also doesn't directly affect consumption.\nE.

        "question": "Commercially available chemical fertilizers contain the same nutrients and micronutrients as organic fertilizers such as manure and composted garden clippings.

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Hello Mun23,\n\nLet me try clearing this one for you.\n\nThe passage talks about chemical fertilizers and organic fertilizers. It mentions that both of these fertilizers contain the same nutrients and micro nutrients. It goes further to say that these nutrients are absorbed by the root hairs of the plants and the source of the nutrients is irrelevant to the plant's ability to absorb them. This implies that plants do not differentiate between the nutrients present in the chemical fertilizers and organic fertilizers . However, the argument then makes a huge leap by stating that organic fertilizers are better for the health of plants when compared to chemical fertilizers. We need to find a reason or an assumption that could validate it. \n\nAny assumption that should strengthen this argument should highlight that chemical fertilizers either lack some property or benefit that organic fertilizer have or that they are harmful in some way. Now let us analyze the answer options.\n\n(A)The nutrients in organic fertilizers are slowly released to the plant over time, rather than being absorbed by the plant immediately.\n\nThe nutrients in organic fertilizers may be released slowly over time. However, nothing in the passage suggests that slow release of nutrients is better for plants than fast release of nutrients. It could be possible that the plants use the nutrients to the maximum possible extent during a particular time and if the organic fertilizers are applied during that time of the day, they might release nutrients very slowly and thus hamper the absorption by the plants. Thus, this cannot be accepted to be beneficial due to lack of further information. \n\n(B)In organic fertilizers, the natural combination of nutrients with other natural materials makes the nutrients more usable by the plant than nutrients found in chemical fertilizers.\n\nNow this suggests that the natural combination of nutrients with other natural materials makes the nutrients more usable by the plant when compared to the combination of nutrients in chemical fertilizers. This is good from the health perspective of the plant as it gets more nutrients to absorb and would grow to be more healthy. On the other hand, the nutrient combination in the same quantity of chemical fertilizers might cause poor absorption when compared to the absorption that would have resulted if organic fertilizers were applied. Hence, this might be the right answer.\n\n(C)Plants often must be provided with nutrients because naturally occurring nutrients in the surrounding soil are depleted or washed away over time.\n\nThis just provides us a reason for application of fertilizers. These fertilizers could be organic or chemical. As this provides no particular distinction between either, this is irrelevant to the discussion at hand.\n\n(D)The typical gardener can't easily know the exact amount and type of nutrients in an organic fertilizer such as manure.\n\nIf anything, this argument provides a way in which organic fertilizers might harm plants. Since gardeners do not have an idea about the amount of nutrients in the organic fertilizer, it might be overused or underused and thus might damage the plant. Hence, if anything this might weaken the argument. Hence, Insufficient.\n\n(E)Chemical fertilizers produced by the leading manufacturer contain nutrients that are no harder for the plants to absorb than those provided by the competitor’s chemical fertilizer.\nThis does not give us any way in which the organic fertilizers might benefit the plants more than chemical fertilizers and hence is not the answer.\n\nHope this helps!

Well, if the chickens are infected but are asymptomatic (the disease does not outwardly manifest itself), then such occurrence would help explain why cows become infected by chicken feed. \n\n(D) nicely provides an explanation: Ferber's disease takes more than a year to show any outward signs in infected animals.

        "question": "Conventional wisdom suggests vaccinating elderly people first in flu season, because they are at greatest risk of dying if they contract the virus. This year’s flu virus poses particular risk to elderly people and almost none at all to younger people, particularly children. Nevertheless, health professionals are recommending vaccinating children first against the virus rather than elderly people.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, provides the strongest reason for the health professionals’ recommendation?\n\nA. Children are vulnerable to dangerous infections when their immune systems are severely weakened by other diseases.\n\nB. Children are particularly unconcerned with hygiene and therefore are the group most responsible for spreading the flu virus to others.\n\nC. The vaccinations received last year will confer no immunity to this year’s flu virus.\n\nD. Children who catch one strain of the flu virus and then recover are likely to develop immunity to at least some strains with which they have not yet come in contact.\n\nE. Children are no more likely than adults to have immunity to a particular flu virus if they have never lived through a previous epidemic of the same virus.\n\n  V 2017 New Question (Book Question: 139)\n</div>",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In this passage, we have an apparent discrepancy:\n\nEven if children are vulnerable to dangerous infections when they contract other diseases such as the flu, this does not change the given fact that elderly people are at greatest risk of dying if they contract the virus. Thus, statement (A) does not explain why the children should be vaccinated first, when the elderly people are more likely to die if they contract the flu. Eliminate (A).\n\nThe point of vaccinating elderly people is to help them avoid contracting the flu virus. Choice (B) tells us that children are the group MOST RESPONSIBLE for spreading the flu virus to others. Thus, if we can keep the children healthy by vaccinating them first, we can greatly reduce elderly people's risk of contracting the virus from those children. Choice (B) explains why we might want to vaccinate the children first, so hang on to (B).\n\nThis statement simply tells us that last year's vaccinations will not be effective against this year's flu virus. This does not address the discrepancy and can be eliminated.\n\nChoice (D) describes an  to a child's contracting of the flu virus. This does not explain why we would want to vaccinate children first, even when the elderly are more likely to die if they contract the virus. Eliminate (D).\n\nThis statement might suggest that children are no more likely than elderly people to have immunity to the flu virus, but that doesn't change the fact that elderly people are at greatest risk of dying if they contract the virus. Choice (E) does not explain why children should be vaccinated first and can be eliminated.\n\n(B) is the best answer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t @ ) | :  |  |  | :  |  |  \n\n:  + \n\n:  |  |"

The report said \"forests . . . are not being damaged,\" which implies that: some, at least a few, are. \nChoice (C) = other countries --- off-topic\nChoice (D) = Not earthshattering.  Acid rain is happening --- if it weren't, they wouldn't do the report in the first place.  The fact that acid rain has been happening to all forest for 15 year is probably agreed upon by all parties.  The question is: is it causing damage?  That's the controversial issue, which this choice doesn't address.  \nChoice (E) = Again, like (A), not big news.  The report says, \" forest . . .  are not being damaged,\" which means some are, which means the severity of damage differs from forest to forest.

This in a way supports the conclusion that the standard codes are to be held responsible for the collapse.\nThus, this is not the correct choice.\n\n\n\nThis is in line with our pre-thinking. It shows that despite the safety codes in place, something unexpected happened that led to the collapse.\nThus, this is the correct choice.\n\n\n\nThe passage says all the safety codes that were required for the equipment storage building were followed except one.

        "question": "Beta Corporation claims that it no longer has enough work for the 60 computer data-entry workers that it is laying off. These workers have heard, however, that the company is buying 100 new computers. So the workers concluded that the company's real reason for laying them off is to fill their jobs with lower-paid workers.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, would most undermine the workers' conclusion?\n\n\n(A) Most of the workers being laid off know how to enter data on a number of different computer systems.\n\n(B) Orders for almost all of Beta Corporation products have increased over the past year.\n\n(C) A recent memorandum from the president of Beta Corporation requested that all data generated by the company be stored in computerized form.\n\n(D) Beta Corporation's computer data-entry workers are more experienced and hence more highly paid than people doing comparable work in other companies.\n\n(E) Beta Corporation's new computers will allow its current management and sales staff to perform many of the tasks that the data-entry workers were previously doing.",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Dear ,\nI'm happy to help.   they were laid off.  The workers assume that their old jobs will be filled by lower-paid workers.  (What's lower pay than data entry is a bit curious, but we'll let that pass.)   Of course, the purchase of 100 new computers fuels the worker's suspicions.   \n\nChoice  says \".\"   Is this data entry?  That's unclear.  It may be that this data is already in some web form, and employees weren't in the habit of saving it, and the memorandum is just instructing folks: as long as you have the data on your screen anyway, you might as well save it in the computer system.   That's one possibility.  Or, it may be the case that Beta Corporation will hire very cheap labor to enter all this data on the new computers --- that would exactly confirm the suspicions of the workers.  So that would be a strengthener, not a weakener.   Of course, we don't know for sure that this latter interpretation is the case, but it's much easier to see how this choice would be a strengthener rather than a weakener, and since it can be a strengthener, it's definitely not the best weakener.  \n\nRemember, on any weakener question, one or two of the wrong answers will be strengtheners, and .\n\nChoice  says \".\"  Now, this genuinely does give an alternate explanation.   It's not that low-wage workers will do this work.  Management will do this work --- management is most certainly not low wage!  Also, sales staff will do the work.  In most corporate settings, sales staff is paid quite well, whereas data-entry are the lowest of the low.   Sometimes, janitors get paid more than data-entry folks.   Here, the recently unemployed data-entry people were just plain wrong --- Beta did not hire a new bunch of low-wage workers.  Instead, workers who were already working at Beta, and already getting paid more than the data-entry people, will absorb that extra work.   This is an alternate explanation that absolutely blows holes in the worker's explanation.   That's why this is the best answer.  \n\nDoes all this make sense?\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)"

This will drive up the cost of producing orange juice and thus push up the price of orange juice for the consumer.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument above?\n\n(A) The recent drought was not as severe as scientists predicted.\n\n(B) States other than Florida also supply oranges to orange juice manufacturers.\n\n(C) Other ingredients are used in the production of orange juice.\n\n(D) Last year the price of oranges was actually lower than the average price over the past ten years.\n\n(E) The price of oranges will eventually be $0.48 per crate.­",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": ", so this is a weaken question. The argument uses an interpretation of evidence reasoning pattern, which can be identified by the presentation of specific facts as evidence. In this case, that the price of Florida oranges this season will be three times the usual because of a recent drought, which in turn will drive up the cost of producing orange juice and push up the price for the consumer.\n\nThe standard assumption of an interpretation of evidence reasoning pattern is that there is no other way to interpret the facts. Because this is a weaken question, the correct answer will demonstrate that the facts do not necessarily lead to the conclusion. In other words, that just because the price of Florida oranges this season will be three times the usual price because of a recent drought, that will not necessarily drive up the cost of producing orange juice and push up the price for the consumer. Evaluate the answer choices, looking for one that matches this idea.\n\n No. This answer choice is out of scope. Even if The recent drought was not as severe as predicted, it could still have enough impact to drive up the cost of producing orange juice and push up the price for the consumer.\n\n Correct. This choice weakens the argument. If Only a small percentage of the oranges used to make orange juice are grown in Florida, then just because the price of Florida oranges will be three times the usual would not necessarily drive up the cost of producing orange juice and the price of orange juice for the consumer in general.\n\n No. This answer choice is out of scope. Even if Other ingredients are used in the production of orange juice, the price of Florida oranges this season (which are) three times the usual price could still have enough impact to drive up the cost of producing orange juice and push up the price for the consumer.\n\n No. This answer choice is out of scope. Even if Last year the price of oranges was lower than the average over the past ten years, the price of Florida oranges this season (which are) three times the usual price could still have enough impact to drive up the cost of producing orange juice and push up the price for the consumer.\n\n No. This answer choice is out of scope. An eventual price of oranges has no impact on the price of Florida oranges this season."

        "question": "Psychologists conducted a series of experiments to test the effect upon schoolchildren of violence in films. In the first experiment, grammar school children were shown a film that included scenes of a male teenager engaging in violent acts against others, such as punching, pushing, and kicking. During a free-play session following the film viewing, 42 percent of the children were observed to engage in one or more violent acts similar to those in the film. In a second experiment, a different group of children was shown a similar film featuring a female teenager. Only 14 percent of the children were observed behaving violently afterward. The psychologists concluded that children are more likely to imitate violent behavior on film when a male model is shown than when a female model is shown.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, would most seriously weaken the psychologists’ conclusion?\n\n\n(A) In both experiments, the victims of the filmed violence included both males and females.\n\n(B) In the second experiment, 28 percent of the children appeared upset during the viewing the violent film scenes.\n\n(C) The first group included 19 male students and 20 female students; the second group included 20 male students and 21 female students.\n\n(D) In the first group, 58 percent of the children appeared bored during the showing of the film, and 12 percent fell asleep.\n\n(E) The percentage of children known to have discipline problems prior to the experiment was greater in the first group than in the second group.",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "one more vote for E. Here's my line of reasoning.\n\nThis stimulus falls into a common reasoning pattern in which the author concludes that because two groups of people, one that is supplied with a product whereas the other is not, present differences between them. The author attributes this differences to the product but does not consider that the differences might have already been there before the supply.\n\nAs a analogy consider a product that claims to make people loose weight. Consider two groups of people. People in group 1 weight less than people in group 2. People in group 1 take the product for 6 weeks after of which they weight less than people in group 2. The study concludes that the product caused that lost in weight. This is clearly flawed.\n\nRegarding the stimulus \n\nA) In both experiments, the victims of the filmed violence included both males and females.  \nThis answer address the victims of the filmed that is not discussed in the stimulus. out\nB) In the second experiment, 28 percent of the children appeared upset during the viewing the violent film scenes.\nFor this to weaken the argument you have to assume that when people view a film while they are upset the film does not influence them. Since we cannot make that assumption, we can rule B out.\n\n(C) The first group included 19 male students and 20 female students; the second group included 20 male students and 21 female students.\nThe stimulus talks about percentages so raw numbers are useless\nD) In the first group, 58 percent of the children appeared bored during the showing of the film, and 12 percent fell asleep.\nThat the children did not like the film does not weaken that the film influenced them. \n(E) The percentage of children known to have discipline problems prior to the experiment was greater in the first group than in the second group.\nThis states that the groups were different prior to the experiment.

One particular layer of sedimentary rock that contains an unusual amount of the element iridium has been presented as support for a theory that a meteorite collided with the earth some sixty million years ago. Meteorites are rich in iridium compared to the earth's crust, and geologists theorize that a meteorite's collision with the earth raised a huge cloud of iridium-laden dust. The dust, they say, eventually settled to earth where it combined with other matter, and as new layers accumulated above it, it formed a layer of iridium-rich rock.\n\nWhich one of the following, if true, would counter the claim that the iridium-rich layer described in the passage is evidence for the meteorite collision theory?\n\n\n(A) The huge dust clo8ud described in the passage would have blocked the transmission of sunlight and lowered the earth's temperature.\n\n(B) A layer of sedimentary rock takes millions of years to harden.\n\n(C) Layers of sedimentary rock are used to determine the dates of prehistoric events whether or not they contain iridium.\n\n(D) Sixty million years ago there was a surge in volcanic activity in which the matter spewed from the volcanoes formed huge iridium-rich dust clouds.\n\n(E) The iridium deposit occurred at about the same time that many animal species became extinct and some scientists have theorized that mass dinosaur extinctions were caused by a meteorite collision.",

        "question": "Automobile manufacturers who began two decades ago to design passenger vehicles that were more fuel-efficient faced a dilemma in the fact that the lighter, more efficient vehicles were less safe on high-speed highways. However, the manufacturers avoided this dilemma by producing two types of passenger vehicles: a lighter vehicle for medium-speed, local transportation, and a heavier, safer vehicle for long-distance travel. Since most automobile traffic is local, a net savings in fuel use was achieved with no loss in safety.\n\nWhich one of the following, if true,  the argument?\n\n(A) Lighter vehicles can have smaller, more fuel-efficient engines without sacrificing power.\n(B) Long-distance drivers are usually made on high-speed highways.\n(C) Every automobile manufacturer now produces a greater number of fuel-efficient passenger vehicles than that manufacturer did two decades ago\n(D) Many drivers use high-speed highways even when traveling locally\n(E) Passenger vehicles today weigh less, on average, than did passenger vehicles two decades ago.\n\nSource : LSAT\n\n : This question asks you to determine which response most weakens the argument. In approaching such questions, you should identify the conclusion of the argument, and find the response that, if true, undermines the argument's support for its conclusion.\n\nA. Incorrect. If anything, this statement would tend to strengthen the argument, by eliminating a reason people might not actually use the lighter, more efficient cars.\n\nB. Incorrect. This statement tends to strengthen the argument, by asserting that part of what the argument takes for granted (namely, that long-distance travel tends to take place on high-speed highways) is actually true.\n\nC. Incorrect. The number of fuel-efficient cars being produced, and the distribution of such cars among the various automobile manufacturers, is irrelevant to the argument.\n\nD. . The argument is weakened to the extent that local travel takes place on high-speed highways. The argument says that \"lighter, more efficient vehicles were less safe on high-speed highways.\" So if people use the more efficient but lighter, less-safe cars for local travel, and much local travel takes place on high-speed highways, the argument's conclusion that there is \"no loss in safety\" associated with the savings in fuel use is undermined.\n\nE. Incorrect. The average passenger vehicle weight is irrelevant to the argument.\n\nDifficulty Level: Easy\n\n: It may seem obvious to say that if the question asks for weakening evidence, one should not choose strengthening evidence, and vice versa, but this is an easy mistake to make when answering questions quickly.

This is then a strengthener for the plan rather than a weakener. \n\n\nInteresting option. If you have followed my analysis, you can see that this option needs consideration. But here, the option only mentions that Fizzles would have to launch an ad campaign to promote the new flavours. There is nothing to suggest that this campaign will have such a significant cost that profit will be impacted (Profit = Revenue - Expenses). Hence, in the absence of any information on the magnitude of costs, this option cannot be the correct weakener. \n\n\nCorrect choice! \nIf you observe carefully, this option works against our assumption 1. \n\nAs per this option, consumers are \n1. Brand conscious (Name recognition). Not an issue because as far as we know, the brand is the same, only the flavours are different (Like Pepsi Blue!)\n2. Price conscious. This means that consumers will definitely prefer a cheaper priced product when given a choice between a cheaper and pricier option. \n3. Not really flavour conscious. This means that as long as it is cheap and satisfies their need (thirst/refreshment), the customers do not care about the flavour.\n\nThe above means that:\n\nPrice sensitive, Flavour insensitive customer -&gt; will not buy exotic flavour, high priced new drinks -&gt; Revenue may not be significant enough -&gt; no profits -&gt; Weakens the plan successfully. \n\n\nInteresting choice. \n\nThe problems with this option are:\n1. We do not know the magnitude of 'few'. Insignificant number or significant number?\n2. We do not know the magnitude of 'loyal to a specific brand'. \n\nFor example, if both 'few' and 'loyal' represent a huge, significant number of customers, then the above statement would read:\n\nA significant majority of consumers would willingly switch to another brand that costs more. This actually strengthens the conclusion (they will buy the new high priced flavours). \n\nNow, if both 'few' and 'loyal' represent a tiny, insignificant number of customers, then the above statement would read: \n\nA small, insignificant number of customers would switch to another brand that costs more. i.e. the vast majority will not switch. Then the company won't make profits. Hence, it is a weakener. \n\nThe issue is that we have no idea which of the above two scenarios does 'few' and 'loyal' represent. So, we cannot definitely say that option (E) serves as a weakener. \n\nHope this explanation helps those are confused about option (E). \n\nCheers!"

        "question": "Cocoa grown organically on trees within the shade of the rain forest canopy commands a premium price. However, acquiring and maintaining the certification that allows the crop to be sold as organically grown is very time-consuming and laborious. Meanwhile, the price premium for the grower is about 30 percent, whereas cocoa trees grown in full sun using standard techniques can have twice the yield of organic, shade-grown trees. Financially, therefore, standard techniques are the better choice for the farmer.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?\n\n(A) Cocoa can be grown only in a climate that has the temperature and moisture characteristics of a tropical rain forest.\n\n(B) Cocoa trees grown using standard techniques require costly applications of fertilizer and pesticides, unlike shade-grown trees.\n\n(C) Although organically grown cocoa has long commanded a price premium over cocoa grown using standard techniques, its price has fluctuated considerably during that period.\n\n(D) Cocoa is not the only cash crop that can be raised on plots that leave the rain forest canopy overhead essentially intact.\n\n(E) Governments and international conservation organizations are working to streamline organic certification so as to relieve farmers of unnecessary work.­",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Could you please give your views on this?Let's break this down and stick to the language that the choice itself is using:\n\n organic certification...\" This implies that the work to streamline is in progress. The streamlining is not complete, and we don't yet know the results..\" The intention of streamlining certification is to relieve farmers of unnecessary work, but don't know how \"unnecessary work\" fits into the total amount of work required to acquire and maintain certification. 1% of that total work might be unnecessary. 90% of that total work might be unnecessary. We also don't know whether \"unnecessary work\" is more expensive than \"necessary work.\"\nChoice (E) is not correct because it doesn't weaken the argument as seriously as choice (B) does.\n\n(E) identifies a potential way that some portion of certification costs might be reduced. If the work to streamline certification is successful, and if the \"unnecessary work\" actually represents a significant share of total work, then we'd have more reason to doubt that standard techniques are the better choice.\n\nBut if the work to streamline certification is unsuccessful, or if the \"unnecessary work\" represents an insignificant share of total work, then we wouldn't have much reason at all to doubt that standard techniques are the better choice.\n\n(E) doesn't give us enough information to know which of these scenarios is true, so it doesn't seriously weaken the argument.\n\nChoice (B), on the other hand, tells us:\n\nIf true, this means that standard techniques are costly in a way that shade-grown techniques are not.\n\nThis is a very concrete statement, with no ambiguity. Standard techniques require costly applications. Shade-grown trees don't require those costly applications. This weakens the the argument much more seriously than (E), and that's why it's the best choice.\n\nI hope this helps!

Danville uses a similar bottle.  Thus, it is likely that many customers intending to buy our wine will mistakenly buy theirs instead.\n\nDanville Winery:  Not so.  The two bottles can be readily distinguished:  the label on ours, but not on theirs, is gold colored.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most undermines Danville Winery's response?\n\n(A) Gold is the background color on the label of many of the wines produced by Danville Winery.\n(B) When the bottles are viewed side by side, Danville Winery's bottle is perceptibly taller than Mourdet Winery's.\n(C) Danville Winery, unlike Mourdet Winery, displays its wine's label prominently in advertisements.\n(D) It is common for occasional purchasers to buy a bottle of wine on the basis of a general impression of the most obvious feature of the bottle.\n(E) Many popular wines are sold in bottles of a standard design.",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "D is the answer. The statement says the wine is sold in distinctive tall, black bottle. Answer D says purchasers will buy on the basis of the impression of the most obvious feature of the bottle which links back to tall, black bottle. The Gold label is not the obvious feature here. Therefore, D weakens Danville Winery's response.\n\nAnswer A kind of strengthen the Danville Winery's response.\nAnswer B can not weaken Danville Winery's response because DW's response is about the gold label.\nAnswer C is irrelevant to the question.\nAnswer E is irrelevant because we are talking about distinctive design here."

        "explanation": "In 80s and 90s, number of people visiting the Sordellian Mountains increased and many new resorts came up. \nNumber of avalanches has remained same.\nBut number of visitors caught in avalanches in these resorts decreased. \n\nWhat helps to explain this? Though more people visited and there were more resorts built, still fewer people got caught in avalanches. \n\n(A) Avalanches were most likely to happen when a large new snowfall covered an older layer of snow.\n\nIrrelevant. We know number of avalanches remained same.\n\n(B) Avalanches destroyed at least some buildings in the Sordellian Mountains in every year.\n\nIrrelevant.\n\n(C) People planning new ski slopes and other resort facilities used increasingly accurate information about which locations are likely to be in the path of avalanches.\n\nSo people used science to make resorts where avalanches do not happen. This certainly explains why even though number of resorts has gone up, number of people stuck in avalanches has decreased. \n\n(D) The average length of stay for people visiting the Sordellian Mountains increased slightly.\n\nIf length of stay increased, probability of getting stuck in avalanches increased too. Does not explain why fewer people got stuck.\n\n(E) Construction of new ski resorts often led to the clearing of wooded areas that had helped to prevent avalanches.\n\nNote the tense - the wooded areas HAD helped prevent avalanches. Now they will not prevent because they have been cleared.

Therefore, some farmers must still be using the banned pesticide on their apple orchards.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the conclusion drawn above?\n\n(A)    Most farmers did not object to the ban and switched to a safer pesticide that was recommended by the EPA.\n(B)    To keep it fresh, most applesauce contains some preservatives, many of which have been investigated for safety by the EPA.\n(C)    Residues of the pesticide linger in the soil from past spraying, are absorbed into the trees' roots, and are deposited in the fruit, even if no spraying was recently done.\n(D)    Many consumers prefer the taste of organically grown fruits, which are not sprayed with any pesticides, and avoid buying fruits sprayed with any type of pesticide.\n(E)    The type of pesticide used to spray apple orchards varies from region to region in the United States.",

It does not directly address the presence of the pesticide. \nThis talks about preservatives used in applesauce, but there is no connection to the specific pesticide found in the applesauce. It is irrelevant to the argument about the banned pesticide. \nThis directly weakens the conclusion. It provides an alternative explanation: the presence of the pesticide could be due to  from past use, not because farmers are currently violating the ban. Thus, the presence of the pesticide in applesauce could be from old contamination. \nThis is about consumer preferences for organic fruits and does not address the presence of the banned pesticide or explain its traces in the applesauce. \nThis is about the variation in pesticide use across regions but does not address the specific issue of why traces of the  pesticide were found in applesauce. </span>­"

These monitors detect the colorless, soundless, odorless gas that can be lethal to humans and pets if inhaled in sufficient quantities. Since forewarned homeowners could flee their homes in the case of carbon monoxide leaks, many of the poisonings and deaths that would otherwise occur could be avoided if homes were required to have carbon monoxide monitors.\n\nThe answer to which of the following questions would be most important in determining whether implementing the proposal would be likely to achieve the desired result?\n\nA. How often do carbon monoxide leaks occur within homes?\n\nB. Where in the home would the monitors be located?\n\nC. Do the carbon monoxide levels at which the monitors signal an alert allow enough time for residents to escape to a ventilated area?\n\nD.

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Ok, so safety officials recommend installing CO monitors because these monitors can detect this gas and forewarn the homeowner before any poisonings or deaths occur.\nWe need to pick a question from below to evaluate the soundness of the officials' argument\n\nA. How often do carbon monoxide leaks occur within homes?\nWe do not really care about the occurrence frequency of CO gas. We are trying to understand whether implementing this monitoring devices will prevent poisonings/deaths. Leaks may occur once a year or once a week for all we care...\n\nB. Where in the home would the monitors be located?\nWe are concerned if this device will help prevent deaths/poisonings we don't care about the location of this monitor. Sure, you may say it would be important to place it where it will be of most use but then we don't have any information whether the location affects the efficiency of the device...\n\nC. Do the carbon monoxide levels at which the monitors signal an alert allow enough time for residents to escape to a ventilated area?\nThis is crucial, because officals recommended that using this device will contribute to preventing deaths/poisonings, but now imagine if the warning signal was not given in time and you get to inhale this toxic gas sufficient enough to poison you before you can escape, this would shatter the argument because installing this device won't really save people...\n\nD. How soon after dangerous levels of carbon monoxide are dissipated can homeowners return to their homes?\nArgument is concerned about alerting people before they are harmed by the gas. We literally don't care if it takes an hour or a month to return back to homes\n\nE. Can the monitors detect other household hazards such as fire?\nWe are concerned about the CO gas not fire. Officials recommended it to prevent CO poisonings not fire or any other hazards...\n\nSo, IMO, the answer is C"

        "explanation": "A) This is not a must be true. There could have been many more than 3 candidates, but only Tom, Jim, and Joanna received votes. Out.\n\nB) There is no way to infer this from the stem - all that is known is that Joanna received the least number of votes. Joanna could be the most popular girl, but she may have been running a platform that most of the students did not like. There is no way to infer her popularity from a college election. \n\nC) Much like B, there is no possible way to infer this from the stem. Campaign hours are not mentioned anywhere in the passage. \n\nD) This is a trap. This is not a must be true. While it may seem that, since Jim won with only 30% of the votes, the votes were not a criterion, in reality they could have been. For example, perhaps it was a requirement this election that the winner needs 25% of the vote, and then at least 3.8 GPA to win the election. Jim had 30%, meeting the first requirement, and a GPA of 3.9, meeting the second requirement while Tom had 50%, meeting the first requirement, and a GPA of only 3.0, not meeting the second requirement. Out. \n\nE) E is the final option, and it works. It must be the case that, some other criterion than just the plain number of votes was used to decide who wins the election. We know this because Jim won with only 30% of the votes. If the number of votes was the only consideration, then Tom would have won the election. Since this is not the case, we know that there is at least one other consideration in choosing the victor. Notice that, unlike D, this is a must be true; We cannot say that the number of votes was not used, but we can say that the number of votes was not the sole criteria for determining the winner. \n\nE is the correct answer."

This could explain why they do. The children are somehow triggered by fast moving balls, a factor that somehow helps them to quickly react and catch the balls. \n\n(B) Incorrect. This does not tell us why children would more easily catch faster moving balls. In fact, it gives us a reason to believe that they would more easily catch slower moving balls.\n\n(C) Incorrect. We have to be careful not to concoct a story from what this choice says, arriving as something like. \"This shows that children are different from adults.

The fact that children do better when they throw faster does not explain why they more easily catch faster moving balls.

        "explanation": "Though choice C states a true fact, that detail is not suggested by any of the information in the passage. Choices E and B both might be true, but nothing in the passage refers to seniors or vitamin D supplements; therefore, even though both are probable, neither can be inferred from the text. \n\nThis leaves us with answer choices A and D. If we think about them carefully, it should be clear that D is the more logical inference. Osteomalacia is a bone disorder. Children can avoid bone disorders by consuming Vitamin D. Vitamin D is found in fatty fish. Tuna and salmon are both fatty fish. By syllogism we can deduce: Young children consuming tuna and salmon ⇒ reduced risk of osteomalacia. Choice D is correct.\n\nChoice A is a tricky distractor, because it seems to be vaguely implied by the excerpt; ultimately, however, choice A is too extreme. The phrases \"large amount\" and \"high risk\" make this too strong to be a natural consequence. Also, just because Vitamin D helps prevent bone disorders, it does not follow that not consuming Vitamin D generates a \"high risk\" of getting bone disorders; other foods may be equally helpful in the reduction of bone disease, and it is plausible that a person might stop taking Vitamin D in order to increase intake of some other bone-beneficial substance."

Therefore, the mere fact that one region's labor is more productive than another's is not sufficient to establish that the former region is more technologically advanced than the latter region is.\n\n(A) The conclusion is not merely a paraphrase of the pieces of information provided in its support. Indeed, the problem with the argument is that the conclusion goes too far beyond what the premises merit.\n\n(B) The premises of the argument are not inconsistent with one another.\n\n. This accurately describes the flaw in the argument because the reasons given in the argument for its conclusion would be good reasons only if there were no other plausible explanations for Parland's greater labor productivity.\n\n(D) The argument does not mention how long Parland has had more productive labor, or when technological improvements would have occurred.\n\n(E) Neither of the premises contains anything that presupposes the conclusion to be true.\n\n</div>­",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "FACT/EVIDENCE:\nCONCLUSION: \n\nWe are told that technological improvements cause increases in labor productivity --- to use the language of formal logic, we know that technological improvements are  for an increase in labor productivity.  This is quite different from saying that: technological improvements are  for an increase in labor productivity.  In other words, the argument is implicitly assuming that absolutely nothing else  ---- labor conditions, local economic conditions, difference in shipping cost for materials or sale, etc. etc. --- would affect labor productivity.  That's crazy.  All kinds of other things also could affect labor productivity.  Technological improvements are  for an increase in labor productivity.  \nParland has higher labor productivity than does Vergia.  One possible explanation  a technological superiority, but again, there are a dozen other things that might differ between the two regions and might account for the difference in labor productivity.   \nThe answer that best summarizes this flaw is (C) --- assuming that one particular cause is the only possible cause, or in other words, assuming that a sufficient cause is thereby also a necessary cause.  \n\nDoes all this make sense?

Because many of those large satellites have ceased to function, the proposal has recently been made to eliminate interference from nonfunctioning satellites by exploding them in space. This proposal, however, is ill conceived, since _______.\n\n(A) many nonfunctioning satellites remain in orbit for years\n\n(B) for satellites that have ceased to function, repairing them while they are in orbit would be prohibitively expensive\n\n(C) there are no known previous instances of satellites’ having been exploded on purpose\n\n(D) the only way to make telescope observations without any interference from debris in orbit is to use telescopes launched into extremely high orbits around the Earth\n\n(E) a greatly increased number of small particles in Earth’s orbit would result in a blanket of reflections that would make certain valuable telescope observations impossible\n\n \n\n question. Typically, Fill in the Blank questions are actually  questions, although you’ll need to read the argument fully to be certain.\n\n. The word proposal refers to the  that satellites be exploded in space. The blank in the argument is connected to the conclusion with the word , indicating that the blank will provide support for the conclusion. Treat this as a  problem.\n\n problems, the right answer will make the conclusion more likely to be correct. In this case, the conclusion is that the proposal (exploding the satellites) is ill conceived. The right answer will support the idea that the proposal is ill conceived. That is, it will work against the proposal.\n\n. The argument does not state that the leftover debris from exploding the satellites will be removed. Presumably, it will remain in orbit, and there will therefore be a larger amount of small debris in orbit. This answer choice states that an increased amount of small debris would prevent certain telescope observations. Preventing these observations is a potential drawback of the plan.</div>",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Responding to a pm:\n\nProblem: Debris interferes with telescope observations but a few large satellites interfere more seriously because of strong reflections.\nSolution: Explode the satellites. Since large satellites interfere more seriously, convert them to debris. The interference will be reduced since debris causes less interference.\n\nQuestion: What is the problem with the solution?\n(E) A large increases in the number of small particles will create a blanket of reflections. This will cause serious interference with telescope observations. Makes sense. Correct answer.\n(D) Doesn't tell us why it is a bad idea to convert satellites to debris. Just says what you should do if you want to get rid of interference completely. Our plan is to decrease interference and this option doesn't tell us why it will not work. We have to focus on the option that tells us exactly why our plan will not work. Our plan is not to completely get rid of interference but to reduce it. We want to improve the observations.

        "question": "Factory workers in Beltania are guaranteed lifetime jobs, bonuses paid on the basis of productivity and corporate profits, and a wage rate that is not attached to a particular job.\nParadoxically, these guarantees do not discourage factory owners from introducing labor-saving machinery. Such innovations are to the factory owners’ advantage despite the fact that the owners must protect the wages of their workers.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, most helps to explain why the introduction of labor-saving machinery is advantageous to factory owners?\n\n\nA. Before a Beltanian Factory worker is hired, he or she must present a record of his or her previous productivity.\n\nB. Labor-saving machinery increases productivity, thus yielding profits that more than cover the cost of retraining workers for other jobs.\n\nC. The purchase and maintenance of new machinery adds significantly to the final cost of the goods produced.\n\nD. Factory workers demand a change of procedure in the routine tasks they perform.\n\nE. Limited competition exists among Beltanian factories for consumer markets.",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If the second answer choice is true, introducing labor-saving machinery results in additional profits even if it also requires the retraining of workers. Hence, this answer choice demonstrates the advantages to the factory owners of labor-saving machinery.  \n\nThe first answer choice is incorrect. Productivity in a previous job may relate to productivity in the job for which a worker is hired. However, if the worker’s job is eliminated by new machinery, the factory owner loses the advantage of having been able to select a highly productive worker for that job. There is no indication in this answer choice of what advantage, if any, the owner gains. C is incorrect. Since increased costs, other things being equal, mean decreased profits, this answer choice suggests the change is disadvantageous to the factory owners. D is also incorrect. Changes of procedure may result for those employees whose jobs are eliminated by the introduction of machinery, but would not necessarily result for a substantial number of factory workers. The owners have an advantage only if a substantial number of workers have been satisfied. Thus, this fourth answer choice cannot explain why the change is advantageous. The last answer choice is incorrect. Limited competition might imply that the factory owners will be able to sell their products, even if the price must be raised to cover new machinery as well as wages. Although this does not harm the factory owners, it does not suggest an advantage either.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n | \n• Tests:  | \n• Guides:  |  |  | \n• Rules:  |"

This in a way supports the conclusion that the standard codes are to be held responsible for the collapse.\nThus, this is not the correct choice.\n\n\n\nThis is in line with our pre-thinking.

        "explanation": "Plan: Increase profit by adding oatmeal\n\nOatmeal is popular among workers\nOatmeal is “the ultimate convenience food” because it can be served by the cup\nOatmeal does not require elaborate cooking equipment so no large investment needed\n\nHence, it seems likely that \"profit\" will increase because investment is less while it is popular. We need to make our plan more likely to be successful:\n\nA. Some of the office building's businesses have recently begun providing free coffee to their employees.\n\nThis is bad news for coffee stand business. If businesses provide free coffee, fewer people will visit the stand.\n\nB. The ingredients needed to make oatmeal are inexpensive and do not spoil easily the way many fresh breakfast foods typically sold at coffee stands do.\n\nSo costs are low and wastage may be low too. This does show that our profits may increase. It is good for our plan. Hence this is the answer.\n\nC. In order to offer more flexible schedules to their workers, several businesses in the office building will soon be expanding their hours.\n\nFlexible schedule means that some people might come in early morning and leave early evening while other may come in afternoon and leave at night etc. So people will be spread out over more hrs, say 18 hrs. Is this good news for our stand, we don't know. Fewer people may come in during breakfast time and if we serve oatmeal only during breakfast, we may not get enough business. On the other hand, more people may come earlier than usual and hence may want breakfast in office so we may get a lot of business. On the whole, how this will impact our coffee stand depends on how the plan is implemented and how people react to expanded hours. \n\nD.

Paradoxically, the hospital's administrators claim that he is the best surgeon currently working at the hospital. \n\nWhich one of the following, if true, goes farthest toward showing that the administrators' claim and the statistic cited might both be correct? \n\n\n(A) Since the hospital administrators appoint the chief surgeon, the administrators are strongly motivated to depict the chief surgeon they have chosen as a wise choice. \n\n(B) In appointing the current chief surgeon, the hospital administrators followed the practice, well established at the city hospital, of promoting one of the surgeons already on staff. \n\n(C) Some of the younger surgeons on the city hospital's staff received part of their training from the current chief surgeon. \n\n(D) At the city hospital those operations that inherently entail the greatest risk to the life of the patient are generally performed by the chief surgeon. \n\n(E) The current chief surgeon has a better record of patients'surviving surgery than did his immediate predecessor.",
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "IMO Option D.The chief surgeon performs those operations which entail the highest risk.This explains his low success rate while performing operations.The hospital staff regard him as the best surgeon because he performs the most complex operations. This resolves the paradox.Please give me kudos. I need them badly to increase my score."

To help track the ruffe’s spread, government agencies have produced wallet-sized cards about the ruffe. The cards contain pictures of the ruffe and explain the danger they pose; the cards also request anglers to report any ruffe they catch.\n\nWhich of the following, if true, would provide most support for the prediction that the agencies’ action will have its intended effect?\n\n(A) The ruffe has spiny fins that make it unattractive as prey.\n\n(B) Ruffe generally feed at night, but most recreational fishing on the Great Lakes is done during daytime hours.\n\n(C) Most people who fish recreationally on the Great Lakes are interested in the preservation of the lake whitefish because it is a highly prized game fish.\n\n(D) The ruffe is one of several nonnative species in the Great Lakes whose existence threatens the survival of lake whitefish populations there.\n\n(E) The bait that most people use when fishing for whitefish on the Great Lakes is not attractive to ruffe.",

Since these councils advise NIH directors and recommend policy, the underrepresentation of social scientists results in a relative lack of NIH financial support for research in the social sciences.\n\nIf the statements above are correct, they most strongly support which of the following?\n\n\n(A) A significant increase in the size of NIH advisory councils would be required in order to increase the representation of social scientists on these councils.\n\n(B) A significant increase in the representation of social scientists on NIH advisory councils would result in an increase in NIH funding for social science research.\n\n(C) A significant increase in funding for social science research would result in improved policy recommendations to NIH directors.\n\n(D) A significant increase in funding for the training of social scientists would result in an increase in the number of social scientist on NIH advisory councils.\n\n(E) A significant increase in the representation of social scientists on NIH advisory councils would have to precede any increase in the number of NIH directors who are social scientists.",
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "This is an inference/conclusion question, and the right answer is . With such questions, the key trap that the GMAT tries to introduce is the confusion between something that \"can be true\" and something that \"must be true\". When you want to verify the correctness of an answer therefore, the best way to do so is to try to falsify it. If the answer \"can be false\", then its wrong to say that it \"must be true\" and is also wrong for the question.\n\nLet's look at this for the right answer B. We know that \"few social scientists in NIH ---&gt; less funding for social science\". B says that if we had a lot more social scientists, we would have more funding as well. Okay, so is it possible that we could have a lot more social scientists and NOT have the funding increased? No, since the premises already contradict that. Hence, we can confirm B is correct.\n\nRemember that many inference/conclusion questions in some way reveal to us that the only things we know for sure tend to be similar to the premises, what we've already been told as a given.\n\n - Matoo\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n_________________"

        "question": "Shelby Industries manufactures and sells the same gauges as Jones Industries. Employee wages account for forty percent of the cost of manufacturing gauges at both Shelby Industries and Jones Industries. Shelby Industries is seeking a competitive advantage over Jones Industries. Therefore, to promote this end, Shelby Industries should lower employee wages. \n\nWhich of the following, if true, would most weaken the argument above? \n\n\n(A) Because they make a small number of precision instruments, gauge manufacturers cannot receive volume discounts on raw materials. \n\n(B) Lowering wages would reduce the quality of employee work, and this reduced quality would lead to lowered sales. \n\n(C) Jones Industries has taken away twenty percent of Shelby Industries' business over the last year. \n\n(D) Shelby Industries pays its employees, on average, ten percent more than does Jones Industries. \n\n(E) Many people who work for manufacturing plants live in areas in which the manufacturing plant they work for is the only industry.",

The reflected waves could then be analyzed to determine how many persons are within the viewing area of the sets. Critics fear adverse health effects of such a monitoring system, but a proponent responds, \"The average dose of radiation is less than one chest x-ray. As they watch, viewers won't feel a thing.\"\n\nWhich of the following issues would it be most important to resolve in evaluating the dispute concerning the health effects of the proposed system?\n\n(A) Whether the proposed method of monitoring viewership can distinguish between people and pets\n\n(B) Whether radar speed monitors also operate on the principle of analyzing reflected waves of electromagnetic radiation\n\n(C) Whether the proposed system has been tried out in various areas of the country or in a single area only\n\n(D) What uses are foreseen for the viewership data\n\n(E) Whether the average dose that the proponent describes is a short-term dose or a lifetime cumulative dose",
        "answer": "E",
        "explanation": "Dear , \n\nI'm happy to help.  .  Without even looking at the answers, I could predict that one or more incorrect answers would address the measurement issue.  \n\nLet's look at the answers: \n \nRelevant to the large issue of --- would this measure things accurately? --- but not relevant to health effects.  This is incorrect.   \n\n \nAn interesting analogy, but radar detectors hit cars, which presumably blocks most of the radiation from hitting the human body of the driver/passengers, whereas these TV zapper things will be shot right at the people sitting there.   This is not particularly helpful, so it is incorrect.   \n\n \nMore data is always good, but suppose we had a literal answer to this --- \"Yes, tried in various areas\" or \"No, only in a single area\" --- if we just had that information, that answer, it wouldn't necessarily tell us anything.  This is incorrect.   \n\n \nThis touches on juicy issues of civil liberties and government monitoring of private information, all of which could play into the larger discussion of whether this system would be legal or morally correct or consistent with the US Constitution, but none of these are relevant to the health effects.  This is incorrect.   \n\n \nAh, this one is relevant to the health effects.  First of all, a single chest X-ray is a wallop of radiation ----- if folks get more than, say, two in a year, that's too much.   If each session of watching TV with this zapper system is equivalent to a single chest X-ray dose, that would be bad enough, but if each session of watching TV were a lifetime's dose of X-rays, then it would be absolutely frying the poor TV viewers.   This one is highly relevant to health effects, so this is the correct answer.   \n\nDoes all this make sense?\nMike \n\nEducation is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. — William Butler Yeats (1865 – 1939)"
